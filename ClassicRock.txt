Gimme your body
Gimme your mind
Open your heart
Pull down the blind
Gimme your love
Gimme it all
Gimme in the kitchen gimme in the hall

Art for art's sake
Money for God's sake
Art for art's sake
Money for God's sake

Gimme the readys

Gimme a bullet
Gimme a smash
Gimme a silver
Gimme a gold
Make it a million for when I get old

Money talks so listen to it
Money talks to me
Anyone can understand it
Money can't be beat
Oh no

When you get down
Down to the root
Don't give a damn
Don't give a hoot
Still gotta keep makin' the loot
Chauffeur driven
Gotta make her quick as you can
Give her lovin'
Make you a man
Get her in the palm of your hand
Bread from Heaven

Gimme a country
Where I can be free
Don't need the unions
Strangling me
Keep me in exile the rest of my days
Burn me in hell but as long as it pays

Art for art's sake
Money for God's sake
Art for art's sake
Money for God's sake
Art for art's sake
Money for God's sake
Art for art's sake
Money for God's sake



[Verse 1]
Well, I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind
I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time
But I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
I feel there's nothing I can do, yeah
I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
After all I knew, it had to be something to do with you
I really don't mind what happens now and then
As long as you'll be my friend at the end

[Chorus]
If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there and holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite

[Verse 3]
You called me strong, you called me weak
But still your secrets I will keep
You took for granted all the times, I never let you down
You stumbled in and bumped your head
If not for me then you'd be dead
I picked you up and put you back on solid ground

[Chorus]
If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there and holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite, yeah
If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there and holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite



[Verse 1]
If I had a gun for every ace I have drawn
I could arm a town the size of Abilene
Don't you push me, baby, because I'm moanin' low
And you know I'm only in it for the gold

[Verse 2]
All that I am asking for is ten gold dollars
And I could pay you back with one good hand
You can look around about the wide world over
And you'll never find another honest man

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country, Sweet Suzie
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down

[Verse 3]
Don't you push me, baby, 'cause I'm moanin' low
And I know a little something you won't ever know
Don't you touch hard liquor, just a cup of cold coffee
Gotta get up in the morning and go

[Verse 4]
Everybody's braggin' and drinkin' that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well I got no chance of losin' this time

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down

[Outro]
Everybody's braggin' and drinkin' that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well I got no chance of losin' this time



[Verse 1]
There's another world inside of me that you may never see
There's secrets in this life that I can't hide
But somewhere in this darkness
There's a light that I can't find
Well maybe it's too far away, yeah
Or maybe I'm just blind
Or maybe I'm just blind

[Chorus]
So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared
And love me when I'm gone
Everything I am and everything in me
Wants to be the one you wanted me to be
I'd never let you down
Even if I could
I'd give up everything
If only for your good
So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
You can hold me when I'm scared
You won't always be there
So love me when I'm gone
Love me when I'm gone

[Verse 2]
When your execution x-ray
Cannot see under my skin
I won't tell you a damn thing
That I could not tell my fans
Roaming through this darkness
I'm alive but I'm alone
And part of me is fighting this
But part of me is gone

[Chorus]
So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared
And love me when I'm gone
Everything I am and everything in me
Wants to be the one you wanted me to be
I'd never let you down
Even if I could
I'd give up everything
If only for your good
So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
You can hold me when I'm scared
You won't always be there
So love me when I'm gone
Love me when I'm gone

[Refrain]
Or maybe I'm just blind

[Chorus]
So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared
And love me when I'm gone
Everything I am and everything in me
Wants to be the one you wanted me to be
I'd never let you down
Even if I could
I'd give up everything
If only for your good
So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
You can hold me when I'm scared
You won't always be there
So love me when I'm gone
Love me when I'm gone
Love me when I'm gone

[Outro]
Love me when I'm gone
When I'm gone
When I'm gone
When I'm gone



Twenty-five years and my life is still
Trying to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination

I realized quickly when I knew I should
That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man
For whatever that means

[Pre-Chorus]
And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out what's in my head,
And I
I am feeling a little peculiar

And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high, and I
Scream from the top of my lungs
What's going on?

[Chorus]
And I say, hey yeah yeah, hey yeah yeah
I said hey, what's going on?

And I say, hey yeah yeah, hey yeah yeah
I said hey, what's going on?

Ooh, ooh ooooooooooooooooh
Ooh, ooh ooooooooooooooooh

And I try, oh my god do I try
I try all the time, in this institution

And I pray, oh my god do I pray
I pray every single day
For a revolution

[Pre-Chorus]
And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out what's in my head
And I
I am feeling a little peculiar

And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high, and I
Scream from the top of my lungs
What's going on?

[Chorus]
And I say, hey yeah yeah, hey yeah yeah
I said hey, what's going on?

And I say, hey yeah yeah, hey yeah yeah
I said hey, what's going on?

And I say, hey yeah yeah, hey yeah yeah
I said hey, what's going on?

And I say, hey yeah yeah, hey yeah yeah
I said hey, what's going on?

Ooh, ooh ooooooooooooooooh ooooooooooooooooh

Twenty-five years I'm alive here still
Trying to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination
Mmh mh



[Verse 1]
We're talking away
I don't know what I'm to say
I'll say it anyway
Today's another day to find you
Shying away
I'll be coming for your love, OK?

[Chorus]
Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

[Verse 2]
So needless to say
Of odds and ends
But that's me stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is ok
Say after me
It's no better to be safe than sorry

[Chorus]
Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

[Bridge]
Oh, things that you say
Is it a life or just to play my worries away
You're all the things I've got to remember
You're shying away
I'll be coming for you anyway

[Outro]
Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two
Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day



Ooo, baby, I love your way, everyday
Ooo, baby, I love your way, everyday

Shadows grow so long before my eyes
And they're moving across the page
Suddenly the day turns into night
Far away from the city
Well, don't hesitate
'Cause your love just won't wait

Ooo, baby, I love your way, everyday
Wanna tell you I love your way, everyday
Wanna be with you night and day

The moon appears to shine and light the skies
With the help of some fireflies
I wonder how they have the power to shine
I can see them under the pine
But don't hesitate
'Cause your love won't wait

Ooo, baby, I love your way, everyday
Wanna tell you I love your way, everyday
Wanna be with you night and day

I can see the sunset in your eyes
Brown and grey, blue besides
Clouds are stalking islands in the sun
I wish I could buy one out of season
But don't hesitate
'Cause your love won't wait, just won't wait

Ooo, baby, I love your way, everyday
Wanna tell you I love your way, everyday
Wanna be with you night and day

Ooo, baby, I love your way
Wanna tell you I love your way
Wanna be with you night and day

Ooo, baby, I love your way
Wanna tell you I love your way



[Verse 1]
Back in black, I hit the sack
I've been too long, I'm glad to be back
Yes, I'm let loose from the noose
That's kept me hanging about
I'm just looking at the sky 'cause it's getting me high
Forget the hearse, 'cause I'll never die
I got nine lives, cat's eyes
Abusing every one of them and running wild

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black

[Verse 2]
Back in the back of a Cadillac
Number one with a bullet, I'm a power pack
Yes, I'm in a bang with a gang
They've got to catch me if they want me to hang
'Cause I'm back on the track and I'm beatin' the flack
Nobody's gonna get me on another rap
So, look at me now, I'm just making my play
Don't try to push your luck, just get out of my way

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black

[Chorus]
Well, I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black, yow

[Bridge]
Ah, yeah
Oh, yeah
Take my love
Yeah, yeah
Yeah
Ah, hey yeah
Ooh, yeah

Well, I'm back (I'm back)
Back, well I'm (I'm back)
Back (I'm back)
Back (I'm back)
Back (I'm back)
Back
Back in black
Yes, I'm back in black
I've hit the sack



[Verse 1]
Riot on the radio
Pictures on the TV
Invader man take what he can
Shootout on the silver screen
Sticking 'em up and knocking 'em down
Living out a fantasy
There's a bad man cruisin' around
In a big black limousine

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't let it be wrong
Don't let it be right
Get in his way
You're dead in his sights

[Chorus]
Big gun
Big gun, number one
Big gun
Big gun kick the hell out of you

[Verse 2]
Terminators, Uzi makers
Shooting up Hollywood
Snakes alive with a .45
Gettin' up and doin' no good
If you ain't wise, they'll cannibalize
Tear the flesh off you
Classified lady killers
Playing in the human zoo

[Pre-Chorus]
He saddle you up
And take you to town
Better look out
When he come around

[Chorus]

Showdown, yeah

[Solo]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Mmm-hmm
Uh-huh

Got big gun, ready or not
Big gun, give it a, give it a shot, come on
Terminator, Uzi makers
A regulator, yeah, gonna get you later

Big gun kick the hell out of you



[Verse 1]
If you're having trouble with the high school head
He's giving you the blues
You wanna graduate, but not in his bed
Here's what you gotta do:
Pick up the phone, I'm always home
Call me anytime

[Pre-Chorus]
Just ring: 3-6, 2-4, 3-6, hey
I lead a life of crime

[Chorus]
Dirty deeds (Done dirt cheap)
Dirty deeds (Done dirt cheap)
Dirty deeds (Done dirt cheep)
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap

[Verse 2]
You got problems in your life of love?
You got a broken heart?
He's double dealin' with your best friend
That's when the tear drops start, fella
Pick up the phone, I'm here alone
Or make a social call

[Pre-Chorus]
Come right in, forget about him
We'll have ourselves a ball

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
If you got a lady and you want her gone
But you ain't got the guts
She keeps naggin' at you night and day
Enough to drive you nuts
Pick up the phone, leave her alone
It's time you made a stand

[Pre-Chorus]
For a fee, I'm happy to be
Your back-door man

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Concrete shoes
Cyanide
TNT (Done dirt cheap)
Neck ties
Contracts
High voltage (Done dirt cheap)

[Chorus]
(Dirty deeds) Do anything you want me to
(Done dirt cheap)
(Dirty deeds) dirty deeds
Dirty deeds (Done dirt cheap)

Yaah!

[Verse 1]
I've been around the world
I've seen a million girls
Ain't one of them got
What, my lady, she's got
She's stealin' the spotlight
Knocks me off my feet
She's enough to start a landslide
Just a-walking down the street

[Pre-Chorus]
Wearing dresses so tight
And looking dynamite
About to blow me out
No doubt about it, can't live without it

[Chorus]
The girl's got rhythm (Girl's got rhythm)

She's got the backseat rhythm (Backseat rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm

Too much for any man
She give me first degree
She really satisfied me
Love me till I'm legless
Aching and sore
Enough to stop a freight train
Or start the Third World War

You know I'm losing sleep
But I'm in too deep
Like a body needs blood
No doubt about it, can't live without it

[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus]
You know she move like sin
And when she let me in
It's like liquid love
No doubt about it, can't live without it

[Chorus]

You know she really got the rhythm (Girl's got rhythm)
She's got the backseat rhythm (Backseat rhythm)
Rock 'n' roll rhythm (Rock 'n' roll rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm



[Verse 1]
A rolling rock, electric shocks
She gives a lickin' that don't stop
She light 'em up, push you 'round
Smokin' rings goin' 'round and 'round

[Pre-Chorus]
Her hot potatoes
Will elevate you
Her bad behavior
Will leave you standin' proud
An' hard as a rock

Hard as a rock
Well, it's harder than a rock
Hard as a rock

Whiskey, gin and brandy
With a glass, I'm pretty handy
I'm tryin' to walk a straight line
On sour mash and cheap wine

So, join me for a drink, boys
We're gonna make a big noise
So, don't worry about tomorrow

[Verse 1]
Living easy
Loving free
Season ticket on a one way ride
Asking nothing
Leave me be
Taking everythin' in my stride
Don't need reason
Don't need rhyme
Ain't nothing I’d rather do
Goin' down
Party time
My friends are gonna be there too

[Chorus]
I’m on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I’m on the highway to hell

[Verse 2]
No stop signs
Speed limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down

Gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me around
Hey Satan
Payin' my dues
Playing in a rocking band
Hey mama
Look at me
I’m on the way to the promised land

I’m on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I’m on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
Don't stop me

I’m on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I’m on the highway to hell

And I’m going down
All the way
I’m on the highway to hell



Paroles de la chanson It's A Long Way To The Top (ac/dc) :
[AC/DC cover]

Ridin' down the highway

Goin' to a show

Stop in all the by-ways

Playin' rock 'n' roll

Gettin' robbed

Gettin' stoned

Gettin' beat up

Broken boned

Gettin' had

Gettin' took

I tell you folks

It's harder than it looks

It's a long way to the top

If you wanna rock 'n' roll

It's a long way to the top

If you wanna rock 'n' roll

If you think it's easy doin' one night stands

Try playin' in a rock roll band

It's a long way to the top

If you wanna rock 'n' roll

Hotel, motel

Make you wanna cry

Lady do the hard sell

Know the reason why

Gettin' old

Gettin' grey

Gettin' ripped off

Under-paid

Gettin' sold

Second hand

That's how it goes

Playin' in a band

It's a long way to the top

If you wanna rock 'n' roll

It's a long way to the top

If you wanna rock 'n' roll

If you wanna be a star of stage and screen

Look out it's rough and mean

It's a long way to the top

If you wanna rock 'n' roll

It's a long way to the top

If you wanna rock 'n' roll

Well, it's a long way

It's a long way, (they tell me)

It's a long way, such a long way, (bagpipe)



Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
Somewhere in this town
See me and the boys, we don't like it
So we're getting up and going down

Hiding low looking right to left
If you see us coming I think it's best
To move away do you hear what I say
From under my breath

Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
Somewhere in the town
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
So don't you be around

Don't you be around

Tonight there's gonna be trouble
Some of us won't survive
See the boys and me mean business
Busting out dead or alive

I can hear the hound dogs on my trail
All hell breaks loose, alarm and sirens wail
Like the game if you lose
Go to jail

Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
Somewhere in the town
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
So don't you be around
Tonight there's gonna be trouble
I'm gonna find myself in
Tonight there's gonna be trouble
So woman, stay with a friend

You know it's safer

Breakout

Tonight there's gonna be a breakout
Into the city zones
Don't you dare to try and stop us
No one could for long

Searchlight on my trail
Tonight's the night all systems fail
Hey you, good looking female
Come here

Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
Somewhere in the town
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
So don't you be around
Tonight there's gonna be trouble
I'm gonna find myself in
Tonight there's gonna be trouble
So woman stay with a friend



[Verse 1]
In the beginning
Back in nineteen-fifty-five
Man didn't know about a rock 'n' roll show
An' all that jive
The white man had the schmaltz
The black man had the blues
No one knew what they was gonna do
But Tchaikovsky had the news

[Pre-Chorus]
He said, "Let there be sound"
There was sound
"Let there be light"
There was light
"Let there be drums"
There was drums
"Let there be guitar"
There was guitar

[Chorus]
Oh, let there be rock

[Solo 1]

[Verse 2]
And it came to pass
That rock 'n' roll was born
And all across the land, every rockin' band
Was blowing up a storm
And the guitar man got famous
The business man got rich
And in every bar, there was a superstar
With a seven year itch
There were fifteen-million fingers
Learning how to play
And you could hear the fingers pickin'
And this is what they had to say:

[Pre-Chorus]
"Let there be light
Sound
Drums
Guitar"

[Chorus]
Oh, let there be rock

[Solo 2]

[Verse 3]
One night, in the club called, "The Shaking Hand"
There was a 42 decibel rockin' band
And the music was good, and the music was loud
And the singer turned and he said to the crowd:

[Chorus]
"Let there be rock"



[Verse 1]
Loose lips sink ships
So, come aboard for a pleasure trip
It's high tide, so let's ride
The moon is rising and so am I

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna get it up
Never gonna let it up
Cruisin' on the seven seas
A pirate of my loving needs
I'll never go down, never go down

[Chorus]
So, let's get it up
Let's get it up, get it right up
Let's get it up, right to the top
Let's get it up, right now

[Verse 2]
Loose wires cause fires
Getting tangled in my desires
So, screw him up and plug him in
Then switch it on and start all over again

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna get it up
Never gonna let it up, no
Ticking like a time bomb
Ooh yeah, blowing out the fuse box
I'll never go down, never go down

[Chorus]
So, let's get it up
Let's get it up, get it up, ow-ow
Let's get it up, right to the top
Let's get it up, right now

[Bridge]
Get it up
Come on and

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
So, let's get it up
Let's get it up, get it up, ow-ow
Let's get it up, right to the top
Let's get it up, right now



[Verse 1]
Well, if you're looking for trouble
I'm the man to see
If you're looking for satisfaction
I'm satisfaction guaranteed

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm as cool as a body on ice
Hotter than the rolling dice
Send you to heaven
Take you to hell
I ain't fooling, can't you tell?

[Chorus]
I'm a live wire
I'm a live wire
I'm a live wire
Going to set this town on fire

[Verse 2]
And if you need some lovin'
And if you need some man
You've got the phone and the number
And I got no future plans

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, come on honey, you've got nothing to lose
You got the thirst 'n' I've got the booze
Give you an inch
Take you a mile
I want to make you fry

[Chorus]
I'm a live wire, (Live wire)
I'm a live wire, (Live wire)
I'm a live wire, (Live wire)
Holy smoke and sweet desire

Like a hot rod, baby

Oh, stick this in your fuse box!
[Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, cooler than a body on ice
Hotter than the rolling dice
Wilder than a drunken fight
You're going to burn tonight

[Chorus]
I'm a live wire, (Live wire)
I'm a live wire, (Live wire)
I'm a live wire, (Live wire)
And I'm gonna set this town on fire

Live wire, (live wire)
I'm a live wire, (live wire)
Well, I'm your live wire, (live wire)
I'm a live wire, (live wire)
Look at me burn
Ow, let me
Meltin'
Short my circuit
Burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn



Yeah!

[Verse 1]
Tailored suits, chauffeured cars
Fine hotels and big cigars
Up for grabs, all for a price
Where the red hot girls keep on
Dancing through the night

[Pre-Chorus]
The claim is on you, the sights are on me
So what do you do that's guaranteed?
Hey little girl, you want it all
The furs, the diamonds
The paintings on the wall

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, loving for the money
Come on, come on, listen to the money talk
Come on, come on, loving for the money
Come on, come on, listen to the money talk

[Verse 2]
A French maid, foreign chef
A big house, with king-size beds
You had enough, you ship them out
The dollar's up, down, you better buy the Pound

[Pre-Chorus]
The claim is on you, the sights are on me
So what do you do that's guaranteed?
Hey little girl, you break the laws
You hustle, you deal, you steal from us all

[Chorus]

[Bridge 1]
Money talks
Yeah-yow!

[Solo]

[Bridge 2]
Money talks
B.S. walks
Money talks
Come on, come on

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Money talks
Money talk, talk, talk
Oh, hear it talk
Yeah, yeah-yeah!
Moneytalk!



[Verse 1]
Somewhere a clock strikes midnight
And there's a full moon in the sky
You hear a dog bark in the distance
You hear someone's baby cry
A rat runs down the alley
And a chill runs down your spine
And someone walks across your grave
And you wish the sun would shine
Cause no one's going to warn you
And no one's going to yell, "Attack!"
And you don't feel the steel
Till it's hanging out your back

[Chorus 1]
I'm your night prowler, I sleep in the day
I'm your night prowler, get out of my way
Yeah, I'm the night prowler, watch you tonight
Yes, I'm the night prowler, when you turn out the light

[Verse 2]
Too scared to turn your light out
'Cause there's something on your mind
Was that a noise outside the window?
What's that shadow on the blind?
As you lie there naked
Like a body in a tomb
Suspended animation
As I slip into your room

[Chorus 1][x3]

I'm your night prowler, break down your door
I'm your night prowler, crawlin' 'cross your floor
I'm the night prowler, make a mess of you (yes I will)
Night prowler
And I'm tellin' this to you
There ain't nothin', there ain't nothin'
Nothin' you can do

"Shazbot, nanu nanu"



[Intro]
Alright
Hey there, all you middle men
Throw away your fancy clothes
And while you're out there, sittin' on the fence
So, get off your ass and come down here
'Cause rock and roll ain't no riddle, man
To me, it makes good, good sense
Good sense, just go
Ow
Ooh, yes

[Verse 1]
Heavy decibels are playing on my guitar
We got vibrations comin' up from the floor
We're just listenin' to the rockers givin' too much noise
Are you deaf, you wanna hear some more?

[Pre-Chorus]
We're just talking about the future
Forget about the past
It'll always be with us
It's never gonna die
Never gonna die

[Chorus]
Rock and roll ain't noise pollution
Rock and roll ain't gonna die
Rock and roll ain't noise pollution
Rock and roll, it will survive
Yes it will, ha ha

[Verse 2]
I took a look inside your bedroom door
You looked so good lyin' on your bed
Well, I asked you if you wanted any rhythm and love
You said you wanna rock and roll, instead

[Pre-Chorus]
We're just talking about the future
Forget about the past
It'll always be with us
It's never gonna die
Never gonna die

[Chorus]
Rock and roll ain't noise pollution
Rock and roll ain't gonna die
Rock and roll ain't noise pollution
Rock and roll is just rock and roll

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
Rock and roll ain't noise pollution
Rock and roll ain't gonna die
Rock and roll ain't noise pollution
Rock and rollin' will survive
Rock and roll ain't no pollution
Rock and roll it'll never die
Rock and roll ain't no pollution
Rock and roll
Ah, rock and roll
Is just rock and roll, yeah



[Verse 1]
All you women who want a man of the street
An' don't know which way you wanna turn
Just keep a-coming
And put your hand out to me
'Cause I'm the one who's going to make you burn

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm going to take you down
Oh, down, down, down
So, don't you fool around
I'm gonna pull it, pull it
Pull the trigger

[Chorus]
Shoot to thrill, play to kill
Too many women with too many pills, yeah
Shoot to thrill, play to kill
I got my gun at the ready, gonna fire at will, yeah

[Verse 2]
I like evil, I get under your skin
Just like a bomb that's ready to blow
'Cause I'm illegal
I got everything that all you women might need to know

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna take you down
Yeah, down, down, down
So, don't you fool around
I'm gonna pull it, pull it
Pull the trigger

[Chorus]
Shoot to thrill, play to kill
Too many women with too many pills, said
Shoot to thrill, play to kill

I can't get enough and I can't get my fill
I shoot to thrill, play to kill
Yeah

[Bridge]
Pull the trigger, pull it
Pull it, pull it
Pull the trigger

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Oh

Too many women with too many pills, I said
Shoot to thrill, play to kill

'Cause I shoot to thrill and I'm ready to kill
I can't get enough and I can't get my fill
'Cause I shoot to thrill, play to kill

[Breakdown]
Yeah
Shoot you down, yeah
I'm gonna get you down on the bottom, girl
Shoot you, I'm going to shoot you
Ooh, yeah
Yeah, yeah
I'm going to shoot you down, yeah-yeah
I'm going to get you down
Down, down, down, down

Shoot you, shoot you, shoot you, shoot you down
Shoot you, shoot you, shoot you down

I'm gonna shoot to thrill
Play to kill
Shoot to thrill



[Verse 1]
Woo!
One, Two

Out on the town, looking for a woman
Gonna give me good love
Anybody want to hang out with me?
And give me plenty of...
She was standing alone over by the jukebox
Like she's something to sell
I said, "Baby what's the going price?"
She told me to go to hell

[Chorus 1]
Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain’t it a shame
To be shot down in flames?

[Verse 2]
Singles bar, got my eye on a honey
Hanging out everywhere
She might be straight
She might want my money
I really don't care, no
Said, "Baby, you're driving me crazy"
Laid it right on the line
When a guy with a chip on his shoulder said
"Toss off, buddy, she's mine"

[Chorus 1]
Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain’t it a shame
To be shot down in flames?

[Bridge]
Hey you, Angus, shoot me, shoot!
That's nice, woah!

[Chorus 1]
Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain’t it a shame
To be shot down in flames?

[Chorus 1]
Shot
Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain’t it a shame
To be shot down in flames?

[Outro]
I don't need the pain
Don't want to be shot down in flames
Ohhh



[Verse 1]
Diamonds and dust
Poor man last
Rich man first
Lamborghini's, caviar
Dry martini's, Shangri-La

[Pre-Chorus]
I got a burnin' feelin'
Deep inside of me
It's a yearning
But I'm going to set it free

[Chorus]
I'm goin' in
To sin city
I'm gonna win
In sin city
Where the lights are bright
Do the town tonight
I wanna win
In sin city

Oh, let me roll you baby

[Solo]

[Bridge]
Ladders and snakes
Ladders give
Snakes take
Rich man, poor man
Beggar man, thief
Ain’t got a hope in hell
That's my belief
Fingers Freddy, Diamond Jim
They're gettin' ready
Look out, I'm comin' in

[Pre-Chorus]
So spin that wheel
Cut that pack
And roll those loaded dice
Bring on the dancing girls and put the champagne on ice

[Chorus]
I'm goin' in
To sin city
I'm gonna win
In sin city
Where the lights are bright
Do the town tonight
I wanna win
In sin city



Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi!
Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi!
Oi! Oi! Oi!

[Verse 1]
See me ride out of the sunset
On your color TV screen
Out for all that I can get
If you know what I mean
Women to the left of me
And women to the right
Ain't got no gun
Ain't got no knife
Don't you start no fight

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm T.N.T., I'm dynamite
T.N.T., and I'll win the fight
T.N.T., I'm a power load
T.N.T., watch me explode

I'm dirty, mean, I'm mighty unclean
I'm a wanted man
Public enemy number one
Understand?
So lock up your daughter
Lock up your wife
Lock up your back door
Run for your life
The man is back in town
So don't you mess me 'round

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm T.N.T., I'm dynamite
T.N.T., and I'll win the fight
T.N.T., I'm a power load
T.N.T., watch me explode

[Intro] (x10)
Thunder, ah

[Verse 1]
I was caught
In the middle of a railroad track (Thunder)
I looked 'round
And I knew there was no turning back (Thunder)
My mind raced
And I thought, what could I do? (Thunder)
And I knew
There was no help, no help from you (Thunder)
Sound of the drums
Beating in my heart
The thunder of guns
Tore me apart

[Chorus]
You've been - thunderstruck

[Verse 2]
Went down the highway
Broke the limit, we hit the town
Went through to Texas
Yeah, Texas, and we had some fun
We met some girls
Some dancers who gave a good time
Broke all the rules, played all the fools
Yeah-yeah, they, they, they blew our minds

[Pre-Chorus]
I was shaking at the knees
Could I come again please?
Yeah, the ladies were too kind

[Chorus]
You've been - thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Yeah-yeah-yeah, thunderstruck
Oh, thunderstruck
Yeah

[Bridge 1]
I was shaking at the knees
Could I come again please?
Yow

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Yeah-yeah-yeah, thunderstruck
Thunderstruck, yeah, yeah, yeah
Said

[Bridge 2]
Yeah, it's alright
We're doing fine
Yeah, it's alright
We're doing fine, so fine

[Chorus]
Thunderstruck, yeah-yeah-yeah
Thunderstruck, thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Whoa, baby, baby (Thunderstruck)
You've been thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Thunderstruck, thunderstruck
You've been thunderstruck



[Verse 1]
It was one of those nights
When you turn off the lights
And everything comes into view
She was taking her time
I was losing my mind
There was nothing that she wouldn't do

[Pre-Chorus]
It wasn't the first
It wasn't the last
She knew we was making love
I was so satisfied
Deep down inside
Like a hand in a velvet glove

[Chorus]
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Too much for my body, too much for my brain
This damn woman's going to drive me insane
She got a touch, a touch too much

[Verse 2]
She had the face of an angel
Smiling with sin
A body of Venus with arms
Dealing with danger
Stroking my skin
Like a thunder and lightning storm

[Pre-Chorus]
It wasn't the first
It wasn't the last
It wasn't that she didn't care
She wanted it hard
And wanted it fast
She liked it done medium rare

[Chorus]
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Too much for my body, too much for my brain
This damn woman's going to drive me insane
She got a touch, a touch too much

Touch me!

[Solo]

[Bridge]
Seems like a touch (touch too much)
You know it's much too much, (much too much)
I really want to feel, yeah (touch too much)
Girl, you know you're giving me (much too much)
Seems like a touch
Just a dirty little touch
I really need your touch
Cause you're much too much, too much, too much

[Chorus]
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Givin' me a touch, a touch too much
Lay me down and touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
A touch too much
A touch too much
A touch too much
Touch
Come on, touch me
Yeah



[Verse 1]
You're workin' in bars, ridin' in cars
Never gonna give it for free
Your apartment with a view, on the finest avenue
Lookin' at your beat on the street
You're always pushin', shovin', satisfied with nothing
You bitch, you must be gettin' old

[Pre-Chorus]
So, stop your love on the road
All your diggin' for gold
You make me wonder
Yes I wonder
I wonder

[Chorus]
Honey, what do you do for money?
Honey, what do you do for money?
Oh, where do you get your kicks?

[Verse 2]
You're lovin' on the take and you're always on the make
Squeezin' all the blood outta men
Yeah, we're standin' in a queue
Just to spend the night with you
It's business as usual again
You're always grabbin', stabbin', trying get it back in
But girl, you must be gettin' slow

[Pre-Chorus]
So, stop your love on the road
All your diggin' for gold
You make me wonder
Yes I wonder
Yes I wonder

[Hook]
Honey, what do you do for money?
Oh, honey, what do you do for money?

[Bridge]
What do you do for money honey?
How do you get your kicks?
What do you do for money honey?
How do you get your licks?
Go!

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Honey, what do you do for money?
I said, honey, what do you do for money?
Oh yeah
(Honey) Oh yeah, honey
(What do you do for money?) What you gotta do?
(Honey) Oh yeah, honey
(What do you do for money?)
What you gonna do?
Ah, what you gotta do?



[Verse 1]
The video games say, "Play me"
Face it on a level, but I take you every time on a one-on-one
Feelin' running down your spine
Nothin' gonna save your one last dime cause it own you
Through and through

The databank know my number
Says I got to pay 'cause I made the grade last year
Feel it when I turn the screw
Kick you 'round the world
There ain’t a thing that it can't do
Do to you, yeah

[Chorus]
Who made who, who made you?
Who made who, ain’t nobody told you?
Who made who, who made you?
If you made them and they made you
Who picked up the bill and who made who?
Who made who, who turned the screw?

[Solo]

[Verse 2]
Satellites send me picture
Get it in the aisle
Take it to the wire
Spinnin' like a dynamo
Feel it goin' round and round
Running outta chips, you got no line in an 8-bit town
So don't look down, no

[Chorus]
Who made who, who made you?
Who made who, ain’t nobody told you?
Who made who, who made you?
If you made them and they made you
Who picked up the bill and who made who?
Ain't nobody told you?

Who made who?
Who made you?
Who made who?
And who made who?
Yeah
Nobody told you?



[Intro]
Wan' tell you a story
'Bout a woman I know
Ah, come [to] loving
She steals the show
She ain't exactly pretty
Ain't exactly small
Forty-two, thirty-nine, fifty-six
You could say she's got it all

[Verse 1]
Never had a woman
Never had a woman like you
Doin' all the things
Doin' all the things you do
Ain't no fairy story
Ain't no skin and bones
But you give it all you got
Weighing in at nineteen stone

[Chorus]
You're a whole lotta woman
A whole lotta woman
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
And you're a whole lotta woman

[Verse 2]
Oh, honey you can do it
Do it to me all night long
Only one that turn
Only one that turn me on
All through the night time
And right around the clock
Woo, to my surprise, Rosie never stopped

[Chorus]
She was a whole lotta woman
Whole lotta woman
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
A whole lotta woman

[Solo]

[Chorus]

Whole lotta woman-man-man-man-man
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta woman
Whole lotta woman



[Verse 1]
She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen
She had the sightless eyes, telling me no lies
Knocking me out with those American thighs
Taking more than her share, had me fighting for air
She told me to come, but I was already there
'Cause the walls start shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching, and we were making it

[Chorus]
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long

[Verse 2]
Working double-time on the seduction line
She's one of a kind, she's just a-mine all mine
Wanted no applause, just another course
Made a meal outta me, and come back for more
Had to cool me down to take another round
Now, I'm back in the ring to take another swing
That the walls were shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching, and we were making it

[Chorus]
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long
It knocked me out that
You shook me all night long
It had me shaking
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me
Well, you took me

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
You really took me and
You shook me all night long
Ah, you shook me all night long
Yeah, yeah, you shook me all night long
You really got me and you, shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me
Yeah, you shook me
All night long



How long has this been going on?
How long has this been going on?

Well, your friends with their fancy persuasion
Don't admit that it's part of a scheme
But I can't help but have my suspicion
'Cause I ain't quite as dumb as I seem

And you said you was never intending
To break up our scene in this way
But there ain't any use in pretending
It could happen to us any day

How long has this been going on?
How long has this been going on?

Oh, your friends with their fancy persuasion
Don't admit that it's part of a scheme
But I can't help but have my suspicion
'Cause I ain't quite as dumb as I seem

Oh, you said you was never intending
To break up our scene in this way
But there ain't any use in pretending
It could happen to us any day

And how long has this been going on?
How long has this been going on?
How long
How long has this been going on?
How long has this
How long has this been going on?
How long
How long has this been going on?



[Verse 1]
I see you coming, I'm supposed to follow
And I don't even want to have the chain
If this is really what it's like to let go
It was all in my brain
Is something living in the house tomorrow?
'Cause he don't even wanna have a face
What would it be if I refused to give up
It was all in my way

[Verse 2]
I see it coming, it's so hard to swallow
'Cause I don't even wanna have to change
How do you sleep if you can hear the echo
Hear it calling my name
I been searching in a love so shallow
Never even wanted half the blame
If this is really what it's like to let go
Was it all in my way?

[Chorus 1]
It's you and it's me
Dog on a leash...

I'm like a dog on a leash
And I'm the one lifeless feeling holding on
I'm like a dog on a leash
And I'm the one starving to save my soul
I'm like a dog on a leash
It's you and it's me, count on the day
Dog on a leash

[Verse 3]
Is there a reason that your hope is hollow now
You don't even wanna have to stay
How would it be if I could learn to let go
Would it all be the same?

[Chorus]
It's you and it's me
Dog on a leash

I'm like a dog on a leash
And I'm the one lifeless feeling holding on
I'm like a dog on a leash
And I'm the one starving to save my soul
I'm like a dog on a leash
It's you and it's me, count on the day
Dog on a leash
Dog on a leash

[Bridge]
It's you and it's me, the dog the leash
And I can't be fine like that
It's you and it's me, the dog the leash

[Chorus 2]
I'm like a dog on a leash
And I'm the one lifeless feeling holding on
I'm like a dog on a leash
And I'm the one starving to save my soul
I'm like a dog on a leash
It's you and it's me, killing the day
I'm like a dog on a leash
It's you and it's me, killing on the day
Dog on a leash



Angel came down from heaven yesterday
She stayed with me just long enough to rescue me
And she told me a story yesterday
About the sweet love between the moon and the deep blue sea
And then she spread her wings high over me
She said she's gonna come back tomorrow

And I said, "Fly on, my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on, my sweet angel
Tomorrow I'm gonna be by your side"

Sure enough, this morning came unto me
Silver wings silhouetted against the child's sunrise
And my angel, she said unto me
"Today is the day for you to rise
Take my hand, you're gonna be my man
You're gonna rise"
And then she took me high over yonder

And I said, "Fly on, my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on, my sweet angel
Forever I will be by your side"



[Chorus]
I'M BACK!
I'M BACK in the saddle again
I'M BACK!
I'M BACK in the saddle again

[Verse 1]
Riding into town alone
By the light of the moon
I'm looking for all Sukie Jones
She crazy horse saloon
Barkeep give me a drink
That's when she caught my eye
She turned to give me a wink
That'd make a grown man cry

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Umm...come easy, go easy
Alright until the rising sun
I'm calling all the shots tonight
I'm like a loaded gun
Peeling off my boots and chaps
I'm saddle sore
Four bits gets you time in the racks
I scream for more
Fool's gold out of their mines
The girls are soaking wet
No tongue's drier than mine
I'll come when I get back

[Chorus]
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm riding, I'm loading up my pistol
I'm riding, I really got a fistful
I'm riding, I'm shining up my saddle
I'm riding, this snake is going to rattle

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Riding high[x2]
Riding high already



[Verse 1]
Got me the strangest woman
Believe me this trick's no cinch
But I really get her going
When I whip out my big ten inch

[Chorus]
Record of a band that plays the blues
Well a band that plays its blues
She just love my big ten inch
Record of her favorite blues

[Verse 2]
Last night I tried to tease her
I gave my love a little pinch
She said now stop that jivin'
Now whip out your big ten inch

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I, I, I cover her with kisses
And when we're in a lover's clinch
She gets all excited
When she begs for my big ten inch

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
My girl don't go for smoking
And liquor just make her flinch
Seems she don't go for nothing

[Intro: Steven Tyler]
Come here, baby
You know you drive me up a wall?
The way you make good on all the nasty tricks you pull
Seems like we're makin' up more than we're makin' love
And it always seems you got somethin' on your mind other than me
Girl, you got to change your crazy ways
You hear me?

[Verse One: Aerosmith]
Say you're leavin' on a seven thirty train and that you're headin'
Out to Hollywood
Girl you been givin' me that line so many times it kinda gets like
Feelin' bad looks good

[Bridge: Aerosmith]
That kinda loving
Turns a man to a slave
That kinda loving
Sends a man right to his grave

[Chorus: Aerosmith]
I go crazy, crazy, baby, I go crazy
You turn it on
Then you're gone
Yeah you drive me
Crazy, crazy, crazy, for you baby
What can I do, honey
I feel like the color blue

[Verse Two: Aerosmith]
You're packing up your stuff and talking like it's tough and trying
To tell me that it's time to go
But I know you ain't wearing nothing underneath that overcoat
And it's all a show

[Bridge: Aerosmith]
That kind of loving
Makes me want to pull
Down the shade, yeah
That kind of loving
Yeah now I'm never, never, never, never gonna be the same

[Chorus: Aerosmith]
I go crazy, crazy, baby, I go crazy
You turn it on
Then you're gone
Yeah you drive me
Crazy, crazy, crazy, for you baby
What can I do, honey
I feel like the color blue

[Bridge: Aerosmith]
I'm losing my mind, girl
Cause I'm going crazy
I need your love, honey
I need your love

[Outro: Aerosmith]
Crazy, crazy, crazy, I go crazy
You turn it on
Then you're gone
Yeah you drive me
Crazy, crazy, crazy, for you baby
I'm losing my mind, girl
Cause I'm going crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy for you baby
You turn it on, then your gone
Yeah you drive me



[Verse 1]
There was a time
When I was so broken hearted
Love wasn't much of a friend of mine
The tables have turned, yeah
Cause me and them ways have parted
That kind of love was the killin' kind
Now listen
All I want is someone I can't resist
I know all I need to know by the way that I got kissed

[Chorus]
I was crying when I met you
Now I'm trying to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was crying just to get you
Now I'm dying cause I let you
Do what you do - down on me

[Bridge]
Now there's not even breathing room
Between pleasure and pain
Yeah, you cry when we're making love
Must be one and the same

[Verse 2]
It's down on me
Yeah I got to tell you one thing
It's been on my mind
Girl, I gotta say
We're partners in crime
You got that certain something
What you give to me
Takes my breath away
Now the word out on the street
Is the devil's in your kiss
If our love goes up in flames
It's a fire I can't resist

[Chorus]

[Bridge II]
Cause what you got inside
Ain't where your love should stay
Yeah, love, sweet love, ain't love
'Til you give your heart away

[Chorus/Outro]
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin' to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dyin' just to let you
Do what you do what you do down to me
Baby, baby, baby
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin' to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm dyin' cause I let you
Do what you do down to , down to, down to, down to
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm dyin' to forget you
Your love is sweet
I was cryin' when I met you



[Verse]
Checkmate honey, beat you at your own damn game
No dice honey, I'm livin' on a astral plane
Feet's on the ground, and your head's goin' down the drain
Oh, heads I win, tails you lose, to the never mind
When to draw the line
A Indian summer, Carrie was all over the floor
She was a wet nap winner, and rarely ever left the store
She'd sing and dance all night, and wrong all the right outa me
Oh, pass me the vial and cross your fingers, it don't take time
Nowhere to draw the line
Hi ho silver, we were singin' all your cowboy songs
Oh, you told Carrie, and promised her you wouldn't be long
Heads I win, tails you lose, lord it's such a crime
No dice honey, you the salt, you're the queen of the brine
Checkmate honey, you're the only one who's got ta choose
Where to draw the line

[Outro]
Checkmate, don't be late
Take another pull
That's right impossible
When you got to be yourself
You're the boss of the toss
The dice, the price
Grab yourself a slice
Know where to draw the line



[Verse 1]
Everytime that I look in the mirror
All these lines on my face getting clearer
The past is gone, it went by like dusk to dawn
Isn't that the way, everybody got the dues in life to pay
I know nobody knows
Where it comes and where it goes
I know it's everybody's sin
You got to lose to know how to win

[Verse 2]
Half my life's in books written pages
Lived and learned from fools and from sages
You know it's true
All the things come back to you

[Chorus]
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord'll take you away

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord'll take you away

[Bridge]
Dream on, dream on, dream on
Dream until your dream come true
Dream on, dream on, dream on
Dream until your dream come true

Dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream on
Dream on

[Chorus]
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord'll take you away
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord'll take you away



[Chorus: Aerosmith]
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady

[Verse One: Aerosmith]
Cruise into a bar on the shore
Her picture graced the grime on the door
She's a long lost love at first bite
Baby, maybe you're wrong, but you know it's all right
That's right
Backstage we're having the time
Of our lives until somebody said
Forgive me if I seem out of line
Then she whipped out her gun and tried to blow me away!

[Chorus: Aerosmith]
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady

[Verse Two: Aerosmith]
Never judge a book by it's cover
Or who you gonna love by your lover
Sayin' love put me wise to her love in disguise
She had the body of a Venus, Lord imagine my surprise

[Chorus: Aerosmith]
Dude looks like a lady
[Dude looks like a lady]
[Dude looks like a lady]
[Dude looks like a lady]

[Bridge: Aerosmith]
So baby let me follow you down (let me take a peek dear)
Baby let me follow you down (do me, do me, do me all night)
Baby let me follow you down (turn the other cheek dear)
Baby let me follow you down (do me, do me, do me, do me)

[Bridge]
Oo, what a funky lady

[Verse 1]
Hey j-j-jaded, you got your mama's style
But you're yesterday's child to me
So jaded
You think that's where it's at
But is that where it's supposed to be
You're getting it all over me, ex-rated

[Chorus]
My my baby blue
Yeah I been thinking about you
My my baby blue
Yeah you're so jaded
And I'm the one that jaded you

[Verse 2]
Hey j-j-jaded

And maybe take a ride to the other side
We're thinking of
We'll slip into the velvet glove
And be jaded

[Chorus]
My my baby blue
Yeah I'm thinking about you
My my baby blue
Yeah I'm so jaded
And baby I'm afraid of you

[Verse 3]
Your thinking's so complicated
I've had it all up to here
But it's so overrated
Love and hated
Wouldn't trade it
Love me jaded
Hey j-j-jaded
There ain't no baby please
When I'm shooting the breeze with her
When everything you see is a blur
And ecstasy's what you prefer

[Outro]
My my baby blue
Yeah I'm talking about you
My my baby blue
Yeah I've been thinking about you
My my baby blue
Yeah you're so jaded
Baby
Jaded
Baby
You're so jaded
Because I'm the one that jaded you

[Chorus 1]
Janie's got a gun
Janie's got a gun
Her whole world's come undone
From lookin' straight at the sun
What did her daddy do?
What did he put you through?

[Verse 2]
They said when Janie was arrested
They found him underneath a train
But man, he had it comin'
Now that Janie's got a gun
She ain't never gonna be the same

[Chorus 2]
Janie's got a gun

Her dog day's just begun
Now everybody is on the run

He jacked a little bitty baby
The man has got to be insane
They say the spell that he was under the lightning and
The thunder knew that someone had to stop the rain

[Chorus 3]
Run away, run away from the pain yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Run away run away from the pain yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Run away, run away, run, run away

[Verse 2]
What did her daddy do?
It's Janie's last I.O.U
She had to take him down easy and put a bullet in his brain
She said cause nobody believes me. The man was such a sleeze
He ain't never gonna be the same

[Chorus 3]
Run away, run away from the pain yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah

Because Janie's got a gun (Tell me it ain't right)
Janie's got a gun (Was it Daddy's cradle robbing that)
Her dog day's just begun (Made you scream at night?)
Now everybody is on the run
Janie's got a gun



[Verse]
Long ago in days I'm told
Were ruled by Lords of greed
Maidens fared with gold
They dared to bare their wombs that bleed

Kings and queens and guillotines
Taking lives denied
Starch and parchment laid the laws
When bishops took the ride
Only to deceive

Oh I know I lived this life afore
Somehow know now truths I must be sure
Tossing turning nightmares burning dreams of swords in hand
Sailing ships the Viking spits the blood of father's land
Only to deceive

Living times of knights and mares
Raising swords for maidens fair
Sneer at death fear only loss of pride

Living other centuries
Deja vu or what you please
Follows true to all who do or die

Screams of no reply they died
Screams of no reply and died
Lordy lordy and then then they died
Lordy no then they died

[Solo]

Live and do or die
Long ago were days I told...Lord they died
Kings and queens and guillotines
Live and no reply they died
Long ago were days I told
Kings and queens and guillotines



[Intro]
I'm dreaming tonight, I'm living back home
Right!
Yeah...yeah

[Verse]
Take me back to a south Tallahassee
Down cross the bridge to my sweet sassafrassy
Can't stand up on my feet in the city
Got to get back to the real nitty gritty
Yes sir, no sir
Don't come close to my
Home sweet home
Can't catch no dose
Of my hot tail poon tang sweetheart
Sweathog ready to make a silk purse
From a J Paul Getty and his ear
With her face in her beer
Home sweet home
Get out in the field
Put the mule in the stable
Ma she's a cooking
Put the eats on the table
Hate's in the city
And my love's in the meadow
Hands on the plow
And my feets in the ghetto
Stand up, sit down
Don't do nothing
It isn't no good when boss man's
Stuffing it down their throats
For paper notes
And their babies cry
While cities lie at their feet
When you're rocking the street
Home sweet home
Mama, take me home sweet home

[Chorus][x2]
I was the last child
I'm just a punk in the street



[Verse 1]
Rock-a-bye baby
If you want to dance
Grab yourself a body
And take a chance
Said one time around
All you get
I'm still dancing
So you lost your bet
I got a hardcore mama
With a hot hoochie coo
Make my wheels start spinning
Like a formula two

[Chorus 1]
I Got one for the money
Two for the show
Three for my honey
And four to let you know that I

[Chorus 2]
Let The Music Do The Talking
Let The Music Do The Talking... cause I can't wait
Let The Music Do The Talking
Let The Music Do The Talking

[Verse 2]
Cheese cake
Maybe if I take another bite
I'm real fat city
I'm an aero delight
Threw out my pipe
And my alkaline
Got a squeaky clean body
And a dirty mind
I'm a real fine dancer
I'll be cutting the rug
Got a brand new baby
She's my brand new drug

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
Let The Music Do The Talking[x6]



[Verse 1]
There's something wrong with the world today
I don't know what it is
Something's wrong with our eyes
We're seeing things in a different way
And God knows it ain't his
It sure ain't no surprise

[Chorus]
Living on the edge
Living on the edge
Living on the edge
Living on the edge

[Verse 2]
There's something wrong with the world today
The light bulb's getting dim
There's meltdown in the sky
If you can judge a wise man
By the color of his skin
Then mister you're a better man than I

[Chorus]
Living on the edge
You can't help yourself from falling
Living on the edge
You can't help yourself at all
Living on the edge
You can't stop yourself from falling
Living on the edge

[Verse 3]
Tell me what you think about your sit-u-a-tion
Complication - aggravation
Is getting to you
If chicken little tells you that the sky is falling
Even if it wasn't, would you still come crawling
Back again?
I bet you would my friend
Again and again and again and again and again
Tell me what you think about your sit-u-a-tion
Complication - aggravation
Is getting to you
If Chicken Little tells you that the sky is falling
Even if it was would you still come crawling
Back again?
I bet you would my friend
Again and again and again and again

[Bridge]
Something right with the world today
And everybody knows it's wrong
But we can tell 'em no or we could let it go
But I'd would rather be a hanging on

[Chorus]
Living on the edge
You can't help yourself from falling
Living on the edge
You can't help yourself at all
Living on the edge
You can't stop yourself from falling
Living on the edge

[Outro]
Living on the edge
Living on the edge
Living on the edge
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Living on the edge
You can't help yourself[x2]
Living on the edge
You can't help yourself at all
Living on the edge
You can't help yourself[x2]
Living on the edge
You can't help yourself[x2]
Living on the edge
You can't help yourself from falling



[Intro:Catherine Epps]
2nd floor...hardware, children's wear, lady's lingerie
Oh, good morning Mr. Tyler, going down?

[Verse]
Workin' like a dog for the boss man
Workin' for the company
I'm bettin' on the dice I'm tossin'
I'm gonna have a fantasy

But where am I gonna look?
They tell me that love is blind
I really need a girl like an open book
To read between the lines

[Chorus]
Love In An Elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down
Love In An Elevator
Lovin' it up till I hit the ground

Jackeys in the elevator
Lingerie second floor
She said 'can I see you later
And love you just a little more?'

I kinda hope we get stuck
Nobody gets out alive
She said 'I'll show you how to fax
In the mailroom, honey
And have you home by five'

[Chorus]
Love In An Elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down
Love In An Elevator
Lovin' it up till I hit the ground

Elevator
Going down
Haha-haha-haha-haha!

[Chorus]
Love In An Elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down
Love In An Elevator
Lovin' it up till I hit the ground

Gonna be a penthouse pauper
Gonna be a millionaire
Gonna be a real fast talker
And have me a love affair

Gotta get my timing right
It's a test that I got to pass
I'll chase you all the way to the stairway honey
Kiss your sassafrass

[Chorus]
Love In An Elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down
Love In An Elevator
Lovin' it up till I hit the ground



(Guitar Solo Intro)

[Verse]
It ain't easy
Living like a gypsy
Tell your honey how I feel
I've been dreaming
Floating down the stream and
Losing touch with all that's real
Whole earth lover
Keeping under cover
Never know where you've been
You've been fading
Always out parading
Keep in touch with Mama Kin
Well you've always got your tail on the wag
Shooting fire from your mouth
Just like a dragon
You act like a perpetual drag
You better check it out
Because someday soon, you'll have to
Climb back on the wagon

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It isn't easy
Living like you wanna
It's so hard to find peace of mind
Yes it is
The way I see it
You've got to say shit
But don't forget to drop me a line

[Chorus 1]
Said, you're bald as an egg when you're eighteen
Working for your dad is just a drag
You still stuff your mouth with your dreams
You better check it out
Because someday soon you'll have to
Climb back on the wagon

[Chorus 2][x2]
Keep in touch with Mama Kin
Tell her where you've gone and been
Living out your fantasy
Sleeping late and smoking tea

(Short Guitar & Saxophone Solo)

[Pre-Chorus 1]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2] [x 2]



[Verse 1]
Blood stains the ivories
Of my daddy's baby grand
I ain't' seen no daylight
Since we started this band

[Chorus]
No More, No More[x2]

[Verse 2]
Store bought clothes
Falling part at the seams
Tea leaf reading gypsies
Fortune telling my dreams

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Holiday Inn, lock the door with a chain
You love it and you hate it
But to me they're all the same

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Baby I'm a dreamer
Found my horse and carriage

[Verse 3]
Stalemate jailbait
Ladies can't refuse
You love them then you leave them
With your sold out reviews

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Sweet talking barroom, ladies' disease
Slipping with her lips
Sliding down your knees

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
Lived my life a screamer
Bound to a wife in marriage
Baby, I'm a dreamer
Found my horse and carriage
Ladies hold the aces
And their lovers call it passion
The men call it pleasure
But to me it's old fashioned
Times they're a changing
Nothing ever stands still
If I stop changing
I'll be writing out my will

[Bridge]
It's the same old story
Never get a second chance
For a dance to the top of the hill

[Outro]
Babe I'm a dreamer
Found my horse and carriage



[Verse 1]
Hey look yonder
What's that I see
Well that old bogus honey
Coming after me
I thought you told her
I was out of town
I wonder how she know'd
I was hanging around
Say, listen baby
Don't go wasting your time
You keep a-comin' 'round
You'll hear the same old line
You got a thousand boys
You say you need 'em
You take what's good for you
And I'll take my freedom

[Chorus]
Cause a-lately it's been so hard, now
To make ends meet, oh yes it has
And honey, oh hey it's a
One Way Street
And I'm going the other way
(heh, heh, heh)

[Verse 2]
I thought I knew her
My cagey lady
How could my sunshine
Be so damn shady
She'll say she loves to talk
A conversation
But I'm the one
Who makes my situation
It's one way city, mmh
And I thought I knew
It's such a pity, honey
I'm dancing for you

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
(Ha ha ha, you know what I'm talking about baby)
(I've seen that butterfly you tattooed on your pants)
(I'm gonna ge' me some of that yeah-heh-heh!)

[Verse 3]
There's nothing over here
I never showed you
I made it pretty clear
I'm glad to know you
You know your brother Spike
He's on the level
But you always looking
Like you're mad at the devil
Don't say I copped a 'tude
It's all forgotten
It's just you're much too rude
Your fruits are rotten
You know I work so hard to keep it alive
Now all I hear from you
Is nothing but jive

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
You're heading down a one way street
You're fooling everybody you meet
I said, you're heading down a one way street
You're fooling everybody you meet
I said, you're heading down a one way street
You're fooling everybody you meet
I said, you're heading down a one way street
You're fooling everybody you meet
You got to get yourself back on your feet
Yeah baby

[Outro]

Oh baby
Lovin everybody yoo-hoo

Come at everybody
Chewin' everybody
Foolin' everybody
Lovin' everybody
Leavin' everybody yoo-hoo



[Verse 1]
Pink it's my new obsession
Yeah, pink it's not even a question
Pink on the lips of your lover, cause
Pink is the love you discovah
Pink as the bing on your cherry
Pink cause you are so very
Pink it's the color of passion
A-cause today it just goes with the fashion

[Chorus]
Pink it was love at first sight
I yell pink when I turn out the light, and
Pink gets me high as a kite
And I think everything is goin to be all right
No matter what we do tonight

[Verse 3]
You could be my flamingo
Cause pink is the new kinda lingo
Pink like a deco umbrella
It's kink - but you don't ever tell her

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
I, I want to be your lover
I, I want to wrap you in rubber
As pink as the sheets that we lay on
Cause pink, it's my favorite crayon, yeah

[Chorus]



[Chorus 1]
Rag Doll living in a movie
Hot tramp Daddy's little cutie
You're so fine they'll never see you leaving by the back door, man
Hot time get it while it's easy
Don't mind come on up and see me
Rag Doll baby won't you do me like you done before

[Verse]
I'm feeling like a bad boy
Mm just a like a bad boy
I'm ripping up a Rag Doll
Like throwing away an old toy
Some babe's talking real loud
Talking all about the new crowd
Try and tell me of an old dream
A new version of the old scene
Speak easy on the grape vine
Keep shuffling in a shoe shine
Old tin lizzy do it until you're dizzy
Give it all you got until you're put out of your misery

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
Yes I'm moving
Yes I'm moving
Get ready for the big time
Tap dancing on a land mine
Yes I'm moving

Old tin lizzy do it until you're dizzy
Give it all you got until you're put out of your misery

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1][x2]



[Verse 1: Steven Tyler]
Get yourself a cooler, lay yourself low
Coincidental murder, with nothing to show
With the judge, constipation will go to his head
And his wife's aggravation, you're soon enough dead

[Chorus]
It's the same old story, same old song and dance, my friend
It's the same old story, same old song and dance, my friend

[Verse 2]
Shady looking loser, you played with my gun
No smooth-face lawyer to get you undone
Say love ain't the same on the south side of town
You could look, but you ain't gonna find it around

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Fate comes a-knocking, doors start locking
Your old time connection, change your direction
Ain't gonna change it, can't rearrange it
Can't stand the pain when it's all the same to you, my friend

[Verse 4]
When you're low down and dirty, from walking the street
With your old hurdy-gurdy, no one to meet
Say love ain't the same, on the south side of town
You could look, but you ain't gonna find it around

[Outro Chorus]
It's the same old story, same old song and dance, my friend
It's the same old story, same old story, same old song and dance



Blues hearted lady, sleepy was she
Love for the devil brought her to me
Seeds of a thousand drawn to her sin
Seasons of wither holding me in

Oh woe is me, I feel so badly for you
Oh woe is me, I feel so sadly for you in time
Bound to lose your mind
Live on borrowed time
Take the wind right out of your sail

Fireflies dance in the heat of
Hound dogs that bay at the moon
My ship leaves in the midnight
Can't say I'll be back too soon
They awaken, far far away
Heat of my candle show me the way
Seeds of a thousand drawn to her sin
Seasons of wither holding me in

Oh woe is me, I feel so badly for you
Oh woe is me, I feel so sadly for you in time
Bound to lose your mind
Live on borrowed time
Take the wind right out of your sail



[Intro]

[Chorus]
Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion

[Verse 1]
Talk about things that nobody cares
Wearing other things that nobody wears
You're calling my name but I got to make clear
I can't say baby where I'll be in a year
Some sweat hot mama with a face like a gent
Said my get up and go, musta got up and went
Well I got good news, she's a real good liar
Because the backstage boogie set your pants on fire

[Chorus]
Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion

[Verse 2]
I pulled into town in a police car
Your daddy said I took it just a little too far
You're telling me things but your girlfriend lied
You can't catch me because the rabbit done died, yes it did
You stand in the front just a shaking your ass
I'll take you backstage you can drink from my glass
I'll talk about something you're sure to understand
Because a month on the road and I'll be eating from your hand



[Chorus]
Lovin you has go to be (take me to the other side)
Like the devil and the deep blue sea (take me to the other side)
Forget about your foolish pride (take me to the other side)
Oh take me to the other side (take me to the other side)

[Verse 1]
My mamma told me there'd be days like this
And man, she wasn't foolin
Cause I just can't believe the way you kiss
Uh uh-huh
You opened up your mouth with baited breath
You said you'd never leave me
You love me, you hate me, I tried to take the loss
You're crying me a river but I got to get across

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I'm looking for another kind of love
Oh Lordy, how I need it
The kind that likes to leap without a shove
Oh, honey, best believe it
To save a lot of time and foolish pride I'll say what's on my mind, girl
You loved me, you hate me, you cut me down to size
You blinded me with love and yeah it opened up my eyes

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Take me to the other side
I'm looking for another kind of love
Oh Lordy, how I need it
The kind that likes to leap without a shove
Honey, you best believe it
Now I'm not one for saying long goodbyes
I hope all is forgiven
You loved me, you hate me, I used to be your lover
You know you had it coming girl so take me to the other

[Chorus]



[Intro]
In the attic lights
Voices scream
Nothing seen
Real's the dream

[Verse]
Leaving the things that are real behind
Leaving the things that you love from mind
All of the things that you learned from fears
Nothing is left for the years
Voices scream
Nothing seen
Real's the dream

[Chorus]
Toys, toys, toys
In the attic
Toys, toys, toys
In the attic
Toys, toys, toys
In the attic
Toys, toys, toys

[Intro]
In the attic lights
Voices scream
Nothing seen
Real's the dream

[Guitar Solo]

Leaving the things that are real behind
Leaving the things that you love from mind
All of the things that you learned from fears
Nothing is left for the years
Voices scream
Nothing seen
Real's the dream

Toys, toys, toys
In the attic



[Verse 1]
Well, on a train, I met a dame
She rather handsome, we kind looked the same
She was pretty, from New York City
I'm walking down that old fair lane
I'm in heat, I'm in love
But I just couldn't tell her so

[Chorus 1]
I said, train kept a-rolling all night long
Train kept a-rolling all night long
Train kept a-rolling all night long
Train kept a-rolling all night long
With a "heave!", and a ho!
But I just couldn't tell her so, no, no, no

[Chorus 2]
Well, get along, sweet little woman get along
On your way, get along, sweet little woman get along
On your way
I'm in heat, I'm in love
But I just couldn't tell her so, no, no, no

[Verse 2]
Well, on a train, I met a dame
She rather handsome, we kind looked the same
She was pretty, from New York City
I'm walking down that old fair lane
I'm in heat, I'm in love
But I just couldn't tell her so

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 3]
Well, we made a stop in Albuquerque
She must have thought I was a real cool jerk
Got off the train, and put her hands up
Looking so good I couldn't let her go
But I just couldn't tell her so

[Outro]
I said, train kept a-rolling all night long
Train kept a-rolling all night long
Train kept a-rolling all night long
Train kept a-rolling all night long
I'm in heat, I'm in love
But I just couldn't tell her



[Verse 1]
Backstroking lover
Always hiding 'neath the covers
"Can I talk to you?" My daddy would say
He said, "You ain't seen nothing
Until you're down on a muff and
Then you're sure to be a-changing your ways"
I met a cheerleader
Was a real young bleeder
All the times I could reminisce
Cause the best things of loving
With her sister and her cousin
Only started with a little kiss
Like this

See-saw swinging with the boys in the school
With your feet flying up in the air
Singing hey diddle-diddle
With your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like I didn't care
So I took a big chance
At the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was fooling
Cause she knew what she was doing
And I knew love was here to stay
When she told me to

[Chorus]
"Walk this way, walk this way"
"Walk this way, walk this way"
"Walk this way, walk this way"
"Walk this way, walk this way"
Ah, just give me a kiss
Like this

[Verse 2]
School girl sweetie
With the classy kinda sassy
Little skirt's climbing way up her knee
There was three young ladies
In the school gym locker
When I noticed they was looking at me
I was a high school loser
Never made it with a lady
Till the boys told me something I missed
Then my next door neighbor
With a daughter had a favor
So I gave her a little kiss
Like this

See-saw swinging with the boys in the school
With your feet flying up in the air
Singing hey diddle-diddle
With your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like I didn't care
So I took a big chance
At the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was fooling
Cause she knew what she was doing
When she taught me how to walk this way
She told me to

"Walk this way, walk this way"
"Walk this way, walk this way"
"Walk this way, walk this way"
"Walk this way, walk this way"
Just give me a kiss
Like this



[Verse 1]
There goes my old girlfriend, there's another diamond ring
And all those late night promises? I guess they don't mean a thing
So baby, what's the story? Did you find another man
Is it easy to sleep in the bed that we made
When you don't look back I guess the feelings start to fade away
I used to feel your fire, but now it's cold inside
And you're back on the street like you didn't miss a beat, yeah

[Chorus]
Tell me what it takes to let you go
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night
Without thinking you lost everything that was
Good in your life to the toss of the dice
Tell me what it takes to let you go

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Girl, before I met you I was F.I.N.E, fine
But your love made me a prisoner, yeah, my heart's been doing time
You spent me up like money, then you hung me out to dry
It was easy to keep all your lies in disguise
Cause you had me in deep with the devil in your eyes

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Tell me that you're happy that you're on your own, yeah, yeah, yeah
Tell me that it's better when you're all alone
Tell me that your body doesn't miss my touch
Tell me that my loving didn't mean that much
Tell me you aren't dying when you're crying for me

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Tell me who's to blame for thinking twice
No, no, no, no, cause I don't want to burn in paradise
Ooo
Let go, let go, let go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
I don't want to burn, I don't want to burn



[Intro]
You see me crying
Don't let it get you down
You see me crying
I'm back to the lost and found

[Chorus]
Honey, what you done to your head
Honey, was the words I said
Honey, what you done to your head
Honey, was the words I said

[Bridge]
You see me crying
Say you're a ladies man
You see me crying
So hard to understand

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
You see me crying
Please say you'll stick around
And I got to be your lover
Let me take you to town
And I'll show you everything around
And I'll never gonna let you down
Cause my love is like a merry go round

[Chorus]



[Verse 1]
I'm broke but I'm happy
I'm poor but I'm kind
I'm short but I'm healthy, yeah
I'm high but I'm grounded
I'm sane but I'm overwhelmed
I'm lost but I'm hopeful, baby

[Chorus]
And what it all comes down to
Is that everything's going to be fine, fine, fine
'Cause I've got one hand in my pocket
And the other one is giving a high five

[Verse 2]
I feel drunk but I'm sober
I'm young and I'm underpaid
I'm tired but I'm working, yeah
I care but I'm restless
I'm here but I'm really gone
I'm wrong and I'm sorry, baby

[Chorus]
And what it all comes down to
Is that everything's going to be quite alright
'Cause I've got one hand in my pocket
And the other one is flicking a cigarette

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
And what it all comes down to
Is that I haven't got it all figured out just yet
'Cause I've got one hand in my pocket
And the other one is giving a peace sign

[Verse 3]
I'm free but I'm focused
I'm green but I'm wise
I'm hard but I'm friendly, baby
I'm sad but I'm laughing
I'm brave but I'm chicken shit
I'm sick but I'm pretty, baby

[Chorus]
And what it all boils down to
Is that no one's really got it figured out just yet
Well I've got one hand in my pocket
And the other one is playing a piano
And what it all comes down to my friends, yeah
Is that everything is just fine, fine, fine
'Cause I've got one hand in my pocket
And the other one is hailing a taxi cab



[Verse 1: Alanis Morissette]
I want you to know, that I am happy for you
I wish nothing but the best for you both
An older version of me
Is she perverted like me?
Would she go down on you in a theater?
Does she speak eloquently
And would she have your baby?
I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother

[Pre-Chorus: Alanis Morissette]
Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you
To be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me
You'd hold me until you died
'Til you died, but you're still alive

[Chorus: Alanis Morissette]
And I'm here, to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair, to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know

[Verse 2: Alanis Morissette]
You seem very well, things look peaceful
I'm not quite as well, I thought you should know
Did you forget about me, Mr. Duplicity?
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner
But it was a slap in the face
How quickly I was replaced
And are you thinking of me when you fuck her?

[Pre-Chorus: Alanis Morissette]
Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you
To be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me
You'd hold me until you died
'Til you died, but you're still alive

[Chorus: Alanis Morissette]
And I'm here, to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair, to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know

[Verse 3: Alanis Morissette]
Cause the joke that you laid in the bed
That was me and I'm not gonna fade
As soon as you close your eyes, and you know it
And every time I scratch my nails
Down someone else's back I hope you feel it
Well, can you feel it?

[Chorus: Alanis Morissette]
And I'm here, to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair, to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
Why I'm here, to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair, to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know



[Verse 1]
Mississippi in the middle of a dry spell
Jimmy Rogers on the Victrola up high
Mama's dancin' with baby on her shoulder
The sun is settin' like molasses in the sky

[Hook]
The boy could sing
Knew how to move, everything
Always wanting more
He'd leave you longing for

[Chorus]
Black velvet
And that little boy's smile
Black velvet
With that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please

[Verse 2]
Up in Memphis
The music's like a heatwave
White lightning
Bound to drive you wild
Mama's baby's in the heart of every schoolgirl
"Love Me Tender" leaves 'em cryin' in the aisle

[Hook]
The way he moved
It was a sin
So sweet and true
Always wanting more
He'd leave you longing for

[Chorus]
Black velvet
And that little boy's smile
Black velvet
With that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please

[Bridge]
Every word of every song
That he sang was for you
In a flash, he was gone
It happened so soon
What could you do?

[Chorus]
Black velvet
And that little boy's smile
Black velvet
With that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please

[Outro]
Black velvet if you please
If you please
If you please
If you please



City nights, summer breeze makes you feel alright
Neon lights, shining brightly make your brain ignite
See the girls with the dresses so tight
Give you love if the price is right
Black or white, in the streets there's no wrong and no right, no

Outta sight, buy your kicks from the man in the white
Feels alright, powder pleasure in your nose tonight
See the men paint their faces and cry
Like some girl it makes you wonder why
City life, sure is cool but it cuts like a knife, it's your life

So forget all that you see
It's not reality
It's just a fantasy

Can't you see what this crazy life is doing to me?
Life is just a fantasy, can you live this fantasy life?
Life is just a fantasy, can you live this fantasy life?

So forget all that you see
It's not reality
It's just a fantasy

Can't you see what this crazy life is doing to me? Yeah
Life is just a fantasy, can you live this fantasy life?
Life is just a fantasy, can you live this fantasy life?
Life is just a fantasy, can you live this fantasy life?
Life is just a fantasy, can you live this fantasy life?
I know
I know



VERSE 1
She struts into the room, well I don't know her
But with a magnifying glance I just sort of looked her over
We have a drink or two, well, maybe three
And then suddenly she starts telling me her life story
She says

CHORUS
"Baby, if you want to be my lover
You better take me home
Cause it's a long, long way to Paradise
And I'm still on my own."

VERSE 2
Told her that I came from Detroit City
And I played guitar in a long-haired rock and roll band
She asked me why the singer's name was Alice.
I said "Listen, Baby, you really wouldn't understand."
And I said

CHORUS (x 2)



[Verse 1: Alice Cooper]
Billion dollar baby
Rubber little lady, slicker than a weasel
Grimy as an alley, loves me like no other lover

[Verse 2: Donovan]
Billion dollar baby
Rubber little monster, baby I adore you
Man or woman living couldn't love you like me baby

[Chorus: Alice Cooper singing, Donovan speaking]
We go dancing nightly in the attic
While the moon is rising in the sky
If I'm too rough tell me
I'm so scared your little head
Will come off in my hands

[Verse 3: Alice Cooper]
Billion dollar baby
I got you in a dimestore
No other little girl could ever
Hold you any tighter, any tighter than me baby

[Verse 4: Donovan]
Billion dollar baby
Reckless like a gambler, million dollar maybe
Fighting like a dog who's been infected by the rabies

[Chorus: Donovan singing, Alice Cooper speaking]
We go dancing nightly in the attic
While the moon is rising in the sky
If I'm too rough tell me
I'm so scared your little head
Will come off in my hands

[Verse 5: Donovan and Alice Cooper]
Million dollar babies
Billion dollar babies
Trillion dollar babies
Zillion dollar babies

Lines form from the ups and downs

We're all gonna rock to the rules that I make
I wanna be elected, elected, elected

[Verse 2]
Good evening Mr & Mrs America and all ships at sea
The candidate is taking the country by storm

I wanna be elected, elected, elected
Hallelujah, I wanna be selected
Everyone in the United States of America

[Verse 3]
We're gonna win this one, take the country by storm
We're gonna be elected
You and me together, young and strong
We're gonna be elected, elected, elected
Respected, selected, call collected
I wanna be elected, elected

[Verse 4]
"And if I am elected
I promise the formation of a new party
A third party, the Wild Party!
I know we have problems
We got problems right here in Central City
We have problems on the North, South, East and West
New York City, Saint Louis, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Detroit, Chicago
Everybody has problems
And personally, I don't care."

{Intro}

I used to be such a sweet, sweet thing
'Til they got a hold of me
I opened doors for little old ladies
I helped the blind to see
I got no friends cause they read the papers
They can't be seen with me and I'm gettin' real shot down
And I'm feeling mean

[Chorus]
No more Mister Nice Guy
No more Mister Clean
No more Mister Nice Guy
They say he's sick, he's obscene

{Instrumental}

I got no friends cause they read the papers
They can't be seen with me and I'm feelin' real shot down
And I'm gettin' mean

No more Mister Nice Guy
No more Mister Clean
No more Mister Nice Guy
They say he's sick, he's obscene

My dog bit me on the leg today
My cat clawed my eyes
Ma's been thrown out of the social circle
And dad has to hide
I went to church incognito
When everybody rose, the Reverend Smith
He recognized me
And punched me in the nose, he said

No more Mister Nice Guy
No more Mister Clean
No more Mister Nice Guy
He said you're sick, you're obscene

No more Mister Nice Guy
No more Mister Clean
No more Mister Nice Guy
He said you're sick, you're obscene



Well we got no choice
All the girls and boys
Makin all that noise
Cause they found new toys
Well we can't salute ya
Can't find a flag
If that don't suit ya
That's a drag

School's out for summer
School's out forever
School's been blown to pieces

No more pencils
No more books
No more teacher's dirty looks

Well we got no class
And we got no principles
And we got no innocence
We can't even think of a word that rhymes

School's out for summer
School's out forever
My school's been blown to pieces

No more pencils
No more books
No more teacher's dirty looks

Out for summer
Out 'til fall
We might not come back at all

School's out forever
School's out for summer
School's out with fever
School's out completely



The telephone is ringing

A nocturnal vacation
Unnecessary sedation
You want to feel at home 'cause you belong

Welcome to my nightmare, whoa-whoa-oh

Welcome to my breakdown
I hope I didn't scare you
That's just the way we are when we come down
We sweat and laugh and scream here

You know inside you feel right at home here

Welcome to my breakdown, whoa-whoa-oh
You're welcome to my nightmare, yeah-yeah-ah

[Intro]
Bury me softly in this womb
I kept this part of me from you
Sand rains down and here I sit
Holding red flowers in a tomb, in bloom

[Verse 1]
Down in a hole and I don't know if I can be saved
See my heart I decorate it like a grave
You don't understand who they thought I was supposed to be
Look at me now a man who won't let himself be

[Chorus]
Down in a hole, feeling so small
Down in a hole, losing my soul
I'd like to fly
But my wings have been so denied

[Verse 2]
Down in a hole and they've put all the stones in their place
I've eaten the sun so my tongue has been burned of the taste
I have been guilty of kicking myself in the teeth
I will speak no more of my feelings beneath

[Chorus]
Down in a hole, feeling so small
Down in a hole, losing my soul
I'd like to fly
But my wings have been so denied

[Bridge]
Bury me softly in this womb
(Oh, I want to be inside of you)
I give this part of me for you
(Oh, I want to be inside of you)
Sand rains down and here I sit
(Oh, I want to be inside of you)
Holding red flowers in a tomb, in bloom
(Oh, I want to be inside)

[Chorus]
Down in a hole, feeling so small
Down in a hole, losing my soul
Down in a hole, feeling so small
Down in a hole, out of control
I'd like to fly
But my wings have been so denied



[Verse 1]
I'm the man in the box
Buried in my shit

[Pre-Chorus]
Won't you come and save me?
Save me

[Chorus]
Feed my eyes
(Can you sew them shut?)
Jesus Christ
(Deny your maker)
He who tries
(Will be wasted)
Feed my eyes
(Now you've sewn them shut)

[Verse 2]
I'm the dog who gets beat
Shove my nose in shit

[Pre-Chorus]
Won't you come and save me?
Save me

[Chorus]
Feed my eyes
(Can you sew them shut?)
Jesus Christ
(Deny your maker)
He who tries
(Will be wasted)
Feed my eyes
(Now you've sewn them shut)

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Feed my eyes
(Can you sew them shut?)
Jesus Christ
(Deny your maker)
He who tries
(Will be wasted)
Feed my eyes
(Now you've sewn them shut)



[Verse 1]
It's alright, there comes a time
Got no patience to search for peace of mind
Layin' low, want to take it slow
No more hiding or disguising truths I've sold

[Chorus]
Everyday it's something
Hits me all so cold
Find me sittin' by myself
No excuses, that I know

[Verse 2]
It's okay, had a bad day
Hands are bruised from breaking rocks all day
Drained and blue, I bleed for you
You think it's funny? Well, you're drowning in it too

[Chorus]
Everyday it's something
Hits me all so cold
Find me sittin' by myself
No excuses, that I know

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Yeah, it's fine, we'll walk down the line
Leave our rain, a cold trade for warm sunshine
You my friend, I will defend
And if we change, well I'll love you anyway

[Chorus]
Everyday it's something
Hits me all so cold
Find me sittin' by myself
No excuses, that I know



[Intro]
Ooh-hoo ooh ooh ooh ooh oohoo
Ooh-hoo ooh ooh ooh ooh oohoo

[Verse 1]
Ain't found a way to kill me yet
Eyes burn with stinging sweat
Seems every path leads me to nowhere
Wife and kids, household pet
Army green was no safe bet
The bullets scream to me from somewhere

[Chorus]
Here they come to snuff the Rooster
Yeah here come the rooster, yeah
You know he ain't gonna die
No, no, no, you know he ain't gonna die

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Here they come to snuff the Rooster, oh yeah
Yeah here come the rooster, yeah
You know he ain't gonna die
No, no, no, you know he ain't gonna die

[Verse 2]
Walking tall machine gun man
They spit on me in my home land
Gloria sent me pictures of my boy
Got my pills 'gainst mosquito death
My buddy's breathing his dying breath
Oh, God, please won't you help me make it through

[Chorus]
Here they come to snuff the Rooster, ah yeah
Yeah here come the rooster, yeah
You know he ain't gonna die
No, no, no, you know he ain't gonna die

[Outro]
Ooh-hoo ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh-hoo
Ooh-hoo ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh-hoo



[Bridge]
Aaah, aaah, aaah, aaah

[Verse 1]
I believe them bones are me
Some say we're born into the grave

[Chorus]
I feel so alone
Gonna end up a big old pile of them bones

[Bridge]
Aaah, aaah, aaah, aaah

[Verse 2]
Dust rise right on over my time
Empty fossil of the new scene

[Chorus]
I feel so alone
Gonna end up a big old pile of them bones

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Toll due, bad dream come true
I lie dead gone under red sky

[Chorus]
I feel so alone
Gonna end up a big old pile of them...
I feel so alone
Gonna end up a big old pile of them...
I feel so alone
Gonna end up a big old pile of them bones



[Verse 1: Jerry Cantrell]
Know me broken by my master
Teach thee a child, love hereafter

[Chorus: Layne Staley]
Into the flood again
Same old trip it was back then
So I made a big mistake
Try to see it once my way

[Verse 2: Jerry Cantrell]
Drifting body, its sole desertion
Flying, not yet quite the notion

[Chorus: Layne Staley]
Into the flood again
Same old trip it was back then
So I made a big mistake
Try to see it once my way

[Guitar Solo: Jerry Cantrell]

[Chorus: Layne Staley]
Into the flood again
Same old trip it was back then
So I made a big mistake
Try to see it once my way

[Outro: Layne Staley]
Am I wrong? Have I run too far to get home?
Have I gone? Left you here alone
Am I wrong? Have I run too far to get home? Yeah
Have I gone? Left you here alone

If I would, could you?



[Verse 1]
Last Sunday morning, the sunshine felt like rain
Week before, they all seemed the same
With the help of God and true friends, I come to realize
I still had two strong legs, and even wings to fly

[Chorus]
And oh I, ain't wastin' time no more
Cause time goes by like hurricanes, and faster things

[Verse 2]
Lord, lord Miss Sally, why all your crying?
Been around here three long days, you're looking like you're dying
Just step yourself outside, and look up at the stars above
Go on downtown baby, find somebody to love

[Chorus]
Meanwhile I ain't wastin' time no more
Cause time goes by like pouring rain, and much faster things

[Bridge]
You don't need no gypsy to tell you why
You can't let one precious day slip by
Look inside yourself, and if you don't see what you want
Maybe sometimes then you don't
But leave your mind alone and just get high

[Verse 3]
Well by and by, way after many years have gone
And all the war freaks die off, leaving us alone
We'll raise our children in the peaceful way we can
It's up to you and me brother
To try and try again

[Chorus]
Well, hear us now, we ain't wastin' time no more
Cause time goes by like hurricanes
Runnin' after subway trains
Don't forget the pouring rain



Walk along the river, sweet lullaby
They just keep on flowin', they don't worry 'bout where it's goin', no, no
Don't fly, mister blue bird, I'm just walkin' down the road
Early morning sunshine, tell me all I need to know

You're my blue sky, you're my sunny day
Lord, you know it makes me high
When you turn your love my way
Turn your love my way, yeah

Good old Sunday mornin', bells are ringin' everywhere
Goin' to Carolina, it won't be long and I'll be there

You're my blue sky, you're my sunny day
Lord, you know it makes me high
When you turn your love my way
Turn your love my way, yeah, yeah



Well I am on the prowl, baby
Looking for someone to satisfy my needs
Some way, somehow
I'm gonna find someone to spend some time with me
I ain't looking, out forever, for some woman to treat a good man right
You look so good, you got me thinking
You might satisfy my soul tonight
Theres no harm done, I know you're the one
You don't got to worry, no hurry
The night's still young
I'm just looking for some good clean fun
I am looking for one woman
Ain't always tryin' to put me down
I don't want nobody
Who's always givin me that same old run around
I ain't leapin'. I'm just leanin'
Looking for that good kind thing
I can tell by the way you're acting
You know exactly what I mean
There's no harm done, I know you're the one
You don't got to worry, no hurry
The night's still young
I'm just looking for some good clean fun
I better slow down, I don't wanna move too soon
I'm so confused, I don't know what to do
Please don't think I am movin' in for the kill
But if you don't want to love me somebody else will
I better slow down, I don't wanna move to soon
I'm so confused, I don't know what to do
Please don't think I am moving out for the kill
If you don't want to love me somebody else will
There's no harm done, I know you're the one
You don't got to worry, no hurry
The night is still young
I'm just looking for some good clean fun
Some good clean fun...ohh, baby
Just looking for some good clean fun...........

Crossroads, seem to come and go, yeah
The gypsy flies from coast to coast

Knowing many, loving none
Bearing sorrow having fun
But back home he'll always run
To sweet Melissa

Freight train, each car looks the same, all the same
And no one knows the Gypsy's name

No one hears his lonely sighs
There are no blankets where he lies
In all his deepest dreams the Gypsy flies
With sweet Melissa

Again the morning's come
Again he's on the run
Sunbeams shining through his hair
Appearing not to have a care
Well, pick up your gear and Gypsy roll on, roll on

Crossroads, will you ever let him go?
Will you hide the dead man's ghost
Or will he lie, beneath the clay
Or will his spirit float away?

But I know that he won't stay without Melissa
Yes I know that he won't stay without Melissa



Well, I've got to run to keep from hiding
And I'm bound to keep on riding
And I've got one more silver dollar
But I'm not gonna let them catch me, no
Not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider

And I don't own the clothes I'm wearing
And the road goes on forever
And I've got one more silver dollar
But I'm not gonna let them catch me, no
Not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider

I've gone by the point of caring
Some old bed I'll soon be sharing
And I've dropped one more silver dollar

No, I'm not gonna let em catch me, no
Not gonna let them catch the midnight rider
No, I'm not gonna let em catch me, no
Not gonna let them catch the midnight rider
No, I'm not gonna let em catch me, no
Not gonna let them catch the midnight rider



[Verse 1]
Everybody wants to know where Jimmy has gone
He left town, I doubt if he's coming back home
Well Tony got a job, three kids and a lovely wife
Working at the commerce bank for the rest of his life

[Chorus]
Nobody left to run with anymore
Nobody left to do the crazy things we used to do before
Nobody left to run with anymore

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna hit the road, adios my friend
Go someplace and start all over again
Don't know where I'm going, like a gypsy out on the road
I'll go someplace and join a traveling show

[Chorus]
Nobody left to run with anymore
Nobody wants to do the crazy things we used to do before
Nobody left to run with anymore
Nobody left to run with anymore
Nobody left to run with anymore

[Verse 3]
I think Jimmy must have had the right idea
Packed his stuff and he got right out of here
I don't know where he's at but I'm sure that he's okay
Now I realize what Jimmy was trying to say

[Chorus]
Nobody left to run with anymore
Nobody wants to do the crazy things we used to do before
Nobody left to run with anymore
Nobody left to run with anymore
Nobody left to run with anymore



[Verse 1]
Ain't but one way out, baby
Lord, I just can't go out the door
Ain't but one way out, baby
And Lord, I just can't go out the door

[Chorus]
Cause there's a man down there
Might be your man, I don't know

[Verse 2]
Lord, you got me trapped, woman
Up on the second floor
If I get by this time I won't be trapped no more
So raise your window, baby
And I can ease out soft and slow
And Lord, your neighbors, no they won't be
Talking that stuff that they don't know

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Lord, I'm foolish to be here
On the first place
I know some man gonna walk in and
Take my place, and
Ain't no way in the world
I'm going out that front door

[Chorus]
Cause there's a man down there
Might be your man, I don't know
Cause there's a man down there
Might be your man, I don't know

Cause there's a man down there

[Outro]
Lord, it just might happen to be your man
Oh, it just-a might be your man
Mmm-mm-mmm-mm
Lord, it just-a might be your man
Oh baby, I just don't know



Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
Tryin' to make a livin' and doin' the best I can
And when it's time for leavin', I hope you'll understand
That I was born a ramblin' man

Well my father was a gambler down in Georgia
And he wound up on the wrong end of gun
And I was born in the back seat of a Greyhound bus
Rollin' down Highway 41

Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
Tryin' to make a livin' and doin' the best I can
When it's time for leavin', I hope you'll understand
That I was born a ramblin' man

I'm on my way to New Orleans this mornin'
Leaving out of Nashville, Tennessee
They're always having a good time down on the bayou
Lord, and Delta women think the world of me

Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
Tryin' to make a livin' and doin' the best I can
And when it's time for leavin', I hope you'll understand
That I was born a ramblin' man

Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man

Have had before

[Intro]
Wake up momma, turn your lamp down low
Wake up momma, turn your lamp down low
You got no nerve baby, to turn Uncle John from your door

[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning, I had them Statesboro Blues
I woke up this morning, had them Statesboro Blues
Well, I looked over in the corner, and Grandpa seemed to have them too

Well my momma died and left me
My poppa died and left me
I ain't good looking baby
But I'm somewhat sweet and kind

I'm goin' to the country, baby do you wanna go?
But if you can't make it baby, your sister Lucille said she wanna go
(and I sure will take her)

I love that woman, better than any woman I've ever seen;
Well, I love that woman, better than any woman I've ever seen
Well, now, she treat me like a king, yeah, yeah, yeah
And she look like a dog gone queen

[Outro]
Wake up momma, turn your lamp down low
Wake up momma, turn your lamp down low
You got no nerve babe, to turn Uncle John from your door



[Verse 1]
I've been run down
I've been lied to
I don't know why
I let that mean woman make me a fool
She took all my money
Wrecks my new car
Now she's with one of my good time buddies
They're drinking in some cross town bar

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel
Sometimes I feel
Like I've been tied
To the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post
Good lord I feel like I'm dying

[Verse 2]
My friends tell me
That I've been such a fool
And I have to stand down and take it babe
All for loving you
I drown myself in sorrow
As I look at what you've done
Nothing seems to change
Bad times stay the same
And I can't run

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel
Sometimes I feel
Like I've been tied
To the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post
Good lord I feel like I'm dying

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel
Sometimes I feel
Like I've been tied
To the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post
Good lord I feel like I'm dying



{Intro}

On the first part of the journey
I was looking at all the life
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
And the sky with no clouds
The heat was hot and the ground was dry
But the air was full of sound

[Chorus]
I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la ..

After two days in the desert sun
My skin began to turn red
After three days in the desert fun
I was looking at a river bed
And the story it told of a river that flowed
Made me sad to think it was dead

[Chorus]
(you see) I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la ...

{Bridge}

After nine days I let the horse run free
Cause the desert had turned to sea
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The ocean is a desert with its life underground
And a perfect disguise above
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
But the humans will give no love

[Chorus]
(You see) I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain

La, la ...



Well I tried to make it Sunday, but I got so damn depressed
That I set my sights on Monday and I got myself undressed
I ain't ready for the altar but I do agree there's times
When a woman sure can be a friend of mine

Well, I keep on thinking about you, Sister Golden Hair surprise
And I just can't live without you; can't you see it in my eyes?
I been one poor correspondent, and I've been too, too hard to find
But it doesn't mean you ain't been on my mind

Will you meet me in the middle, will you meet me in the air?
Will you love me just a little, just enough to show you care?
Well I tried to fake it, I don't mind sayin', I just can't make it

Well, I keep on thinkin' 'bout you, Sister Golden Hair surprise
And I just can't live without you; can't you see it in my eyes?
Now I been one poor correspondent, and I been too, too hard to find
But it doesn't mean you ain't been on my mind

Will you meet me in the middle, will you meet me in the air?
Will you love me just a little, just enough to show you care?
Well I tried to fake it, I don't mind sayin', I just can't make it



[Verse 1]
Chewing on a piece of grass
Walking down the road
Tell me, how long you gonna stay here, Joe?
Some people say this town don't look good in snow
You don't care, I know

[Chorus]
Ventura Highway in the sunshine
Where the days are longer
The nights are stronger than moonshine
You're gonna go I know
Cause the free wind is blowing through your hair
And the days surround your daylight there
Seasons crying no despair
Alligator lizards in the air, in the air

Did di di di dit ...

Wishing on a falling star
Waiting for the early train
Sorry boy, but I've been hit by purple rain
Aw, come on, Joe, you can always
Change your name
Thanks a lot, son, just the same

[Chorus]
Ventura Highway in the sunshine
Where the days are longer
The nights are stronger than moonshine
You're gonna go I know
Cause the free wind is blowing through your hair
And the days surround your daylight there
Seasons crying no despair
Alligator lizards in the air, in the air

Did di di di dit ...



When you complain and criticize
I feel I'm nothing in your eyes
It makes me feel like giving up
Because my best just ain't good enough

Girl, I want to provide for you
And do all the things that you want me to, but

Oh, oh no!
Don't bring me down
I'm beggin' you, darlin'
Oh, oh no!
Don't bring me down

Sacrifices I will make
I'm ready to give as well as take
One thing I need is your respect
One thing I can't take is your neglect

More than anything, I need your love
Then troubles are easy to rise above

Oh, oh no!
Don't bring me down
Oh no, no, no, no, no
Oh, oh no!
Don't bring me down

You complain and criticize
I feel I'm nothing in your eyes
It makes me feel like giving up
Because my best just ain't good enough

Girl, I want to provide for you
Do all the things that you want me to, but

Oh, oh no!
Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'm beggin'
Oh no!
Don't bring me down

Oh no, no
Baby, please!
Oh, oh no!
Don't bring me down
I need your tender lovin'
So please, don't bring me down

Oh, baby, baby, baby, don't hurt me
Don't bring me down
Oh no, please don't hurt me



[Hook]
What am I afraid of?
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say you promised you would never change

[Verse 1]
I just feel like you broke a promise to me
Only hurt cause I thought you were being honest with me
So I’m gon' try and do this honorably
Without the sponsoring fee what’s most alarming to me
This so emotional for you, robust such the calm in me,
Easy to put off notes in thugs harmony
Speak to his insecurity, acting so irresponsibly
And it's further impacted by the fact that you respond to me
See some of us know you as Jimmy barely old
He had the baby belly fro, nigga was frail up in his clothes
Barely got a hold and it’s seeming very outta control
Wish we could go back and grab the blackberry with the scroll, oh
Yeah Aubrey that’s the one we trusted
Not this new Aubrey with his stomach sculpted
I'm disgusted, you're such a fuckin' incumbent
Can't govern, trust in the public becoming a fucking puppet
It’s bigger than rap battles, a word for the digital cash castle Don’t let a glitch in the Mac crash you
Unrelaxed wearing political straps tackled
Now clash paths with dad, the original bad apple
I know where you at, shit I was there too
When shit was happening fast, word, I got scared too
Impossible feats, impossible to sleep
Making promises impossible to keep like

[Hook]
What am I afraid of?
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say you promised you would never change

[Verse 2]
Listen, alert the niggas that handle you
You fill up tour seats but you raw meat to the animals
Doggy to cannibal, morning coffee and sandal shoes
Can’t get this energy off me, it isn’t tangible
This shit is greater than me, Pitchfork and Fader agree
Complex I’m waiting to see, this between us, A and B
You on the cusp Rated G, film I ain’t paying to see
I’m patiently waiting with please
Thought you would take it in, breathe
Blatantly seein' his whole channel real A&E
Hard to sound empty inside and fill a vacancy
Get some advice, come over kick it and vibe
I’m here with hotels, strippers, Odell, all that shit that you like
We'll light some candles and some hookah
Hookers flickin' the lights
We'll play Aaliyah's greatest hits, you'll get all tickled inside
My nigga, It's no wonder you're losing all your friends
Poster child now for all that you had a wall against
And tell your mans I’ll be seeing him soon
He marched you right into this madness I got reason to assume
I creep in his room, sweeper consumed
Now his region of doom ain’t the legion of boom it's just me with a broom
Afterward I’m thinking we can resume a lesson in speaking too soon
How is it too late if I’m reading ya tomb
It's not, boys inordinate, ploys and ornaments
Show up at party next door with a noise ordinance
So off the hook of me, maybe y'all should be shook of me
Should know I’d kill him at even the slightest push of me
And when his team press up shirts, I’ll help 'em push a tee, Should it read, he pressed buttons but wouldn’t push a tee
Gotta be buggin', maybe he dunno where Pusha be
Or when Pusha push the agenda he isn’t pushed to see
If pushed to the streets, I see wood in your physique
Thinking you misunderstood my hood, this isn’t Meek nigga
This ain’t a standard that you couldn’t meet
Just from your views, you prolly couldn’t see
That's cool, that kind of success you could never plan for it
Heard the question nigga, I’ma help you answer it

[Hook]
What am I afraid of?
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say you promised you would never change

[Outro]
What am I afraid of?
What am I afraid of?
What am I afraid of?
What am I afraid of?
What am I afraid of?
What am I afraid of?
What am I afraid of?
What am I afraid of?
What am I afraid of?
What am I afraid of?
What am I afraid of?
What am I afraid of?
What am I afraid of?
What am I afraid of?
What am I afraid of?
What am I?



[Intro]​
(2, 3, 4)

[Chorus]
Ahh! Ahh!
We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow

[Verse 1]
The hammer of the gods
Will drive our ships to new lands
To fight the horde
Sing and cry
Valhalla, I am coming

[Hook]
On we sweep with threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore

[Chorus]
Ahh! Ahh!
We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow

[Verse 2]
How soft your fields so green
Can whisper tales of gore
Of how we calmed the tides of war
We are your overlords

[Hook]
On we sweep with threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore

[Verse 3]
So now you'd better stop
And rebuild all your ruins
For peace and trust can win the day
Despite of all your losing



Alright

{Intro}

And if it's bad
Don't let it get you down, you can take it
And if it hurts
Don't let them see you cry, you can make it

Hold your head up, oh
Hold your head up, oh
Hold your head up, oh
Hold your head high
Hold your head up, oh
Hold your head up, oh

Coming in from London from over the pole
Flying in a big airliner
Chickens flying everywhere around the plane
Could we ever feel much finer?

Coming into Los Angeles
Bringing in a couple of keys
But don't touch my bags if you please
Mister Customs Man

There's a guy with a ticket to Mexico
No, he couldn't look much stranger
Walking in the hall with his things and all
Smiling, said he was the Lone Ranger

Coming into Los Angeles
Bringing in a couple of keys
But don't touch my bags if you please
Mister Customs Man

Hip woman walking on a moving floor
Tripping on the escalator
There's a man in the line and she's blowing his mind
Thinking that he's already made her

Coming into Los Angeles
Bringing in a couple of keys
But don't touch my bags if you please
Mister Customs Man



Martin Cunningham, first, poked his silkhatted head into the creaking carriage and, entering deftly, seated himself. Mr Power stepped in after him, curving his height with care.

—Come on, Simon.

—After you, Mr Bloom said.

Mr Dedalus covered himself quickly and got in, saying:

Yes, yes.

—Are we all here now? Martin Cunningham asked. Come along, Bloom.

Mr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place. He pulled the door to after him and slammed it twice till it shut tight. He passed an arm through the armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriagewindow at the lowered blinds of the avenue. One dragged aside: an old woman peeping. Nose whiteflattened against the pane. Thanking her stars she was passed over. Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse. Glad to see us go we give them such trouble coming. Job seems to suit them. Huggermugger in corners. Slop about in slipperslappers for fear he'd wake. Then getting it ready. Laying it out. Molly and Mrs Fleming making the bed. Pull it more to your side. Our windingsheet. Never know who will touch you dead. Wash and shampoo. I believe they clip the nails and the hair. Keep a bit in an envelope. Grows all the same after. Unclean job.

All waited. Nothing was said. Stowing in the wreaths probably. I am sitting on something hard. Ah, that soap: in my hip pocket. Better shift it out of that. Wait for an opportunity.

All waited. Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: then nearer: then horses' hoofs. A jolt. Their carriage began to move, creaking and swaying. Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind. The blinds of the avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker, door ajar. At walking pace.

They waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were passing along the tramtracks. Tritonville road. Quicker. The wheels rattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook rattling in the doorframes.

—What way is he taking us? Mr Power asked through both windows.

—Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said. Ringsend. Brunswick street.

Mr Dedalus nodded, looking out.

—That's a fine old custom, he said. I am glad to see it has not died out.
All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by passers. Respect. The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the smoother road past Watery lane. Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man, clad in mourning, a wide hat.

—There's a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said.

—Who is that?

—Your son and heir.

—Where is he? Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across.

The carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway before the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back to the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels. Mr Dedalus fell back, saying:

—Was that Mulligan cad with him? His fidus Achates!

—No, Mr Bloom said. He was alone.

—Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Goulding faction, the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papa's little lump of dung, the wise child that knows her own father.

Mr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road. Wallace Bros: the bottleworks: Dodder bridge.

Richie Goulding and the legal bag. Goulding, Collis and Ward he calls the firm. His jokes are getting a bit damp. Great card he was. Waltzing in Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning, the landlady's two hats pinned on his head. Out on the rampage all night. Beginning to tell on him now: that backache of his, I fear. Wife ironing his back. Thinks he'll cure it with pills. All breadcrumbs they are. About six hundred per cent profit.

—He's in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled. That Mulligan is a contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts. His name stinks all over Dublin. But with the help of God and His blessed mother I'll make it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother or his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a gate. I'll tickle his catastrophe, believe you me.

He cried above the clatter of the wheels:

—I won't have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son. A counterjumper's son. Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul M'Swiney's. Not likely.

He ceased. Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power's mild face and Martin Cunningham's eyes and beard, gravely shaking. Noisy selfwilled man. Full of his son. He is right. Something to hand on. If little Rudy had lived. See him grow up. Hear his voice in the house. Walking beside Molly in an Eton suit. My son. Me in his eyes. Strange feeling it would be. From me. Just a chance. Must have been that morning in Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogs at it by the wall of the cease to do evil. And the sergeant grinning up. She had that cream gown on with the rip she never stitched. Give us a touch, Poldy. God, I'm dying for it. How life begins.

Got big then. Had to refuse the Greystones concert. My son inside her. I could have helped him on in life. I could. Make him independent. Learn German too.

—Are we late? Mr Power asked.

—Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch.

Molly. Milly. Same thing watered down. Her tomboy oaths. O jumping Jupiter! Ye gods and little fishes! Still, she's a dear girl. Soon be a woman. Mullingar. Dearest Papli. Young student. Yes, yes: a woman too. Life, life.

The carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.

—Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.

—He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn't that squint troubling him. Do you follow me?

He closed his left eye. Martin Cunningham began to brush away crustcrumbs from under his thighs.

—What is this, he said, in the name of God? Crumbs?

—Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power said.

All raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless leather of the seats. Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowned downward and said:

—Unless I'm greatly mistaken. What do you think, Martin?

—It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said.

Mr Bloom set his thigh down. Glad I took that bath. Feel my feet quite clean. But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better.

Mr Dedalus sighed resignedly.

—After all, he said, it's the most natural thing in the world.

—Did Tom Kernan turn up? Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak of his beard gently.

—Yes, Mr Bloom answered. He's behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes.

—And Corny Kelleher himself? Mr Power asked.

—At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said.

—I met M'Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said. He said he'd try to come.

The carriage halted short.

—What's wrong?

—We're stopped.

—Where are we?

Mr Bloom put his head out of the window.

—The grand canal, he said.

Gasworks. Whooping cough they say it cures. Good job Milly never got it. Poor children! Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions. Shame really. Got off lightly with illnesses compared. Only measles. Flaxseed tea. Scarlatina, influenza epidemics. Canvassing for death. Don't miss this chance. Dogs' home over there. Poor old Athos! Be good to Athos, Leopold, is my last wish. Thy will be done. We obey them in the grave. A dying scrawl. He took it to heart, pined away. Quiet brute. Old men's dogs usually are.

A raindrop spat on his hat. He drew back and saw an instant of shower spray dots over the grey flags. Apart. Curious. Like through a colander. I thought it would. My boots were creaking I remember now.

—The weather is changing, he said quietly.

—A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.

—Wanted for the country, Mr Power said. There's the sun again coming out.

Mr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled a mute curse at the sky.

—It's as uncertain as a child's bottom, he said.

—We're off again.

The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed gently. Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.

—Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said. And Paddy Leonard taking him off to his face.

—O, draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly. Wait till you hear him, Simon, on Ben Dollard's singing of The Croppy Boy.

—Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously. His singing of that simple ballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the whole course of my experience.

—Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing. He's dead nuts on that. And the retrospective arrangement.

—Did you read Dan Dawson's speech? Martin Cunningham asked.

—I did not then, Mr Dedalus said. Where is it?

—In the paper this morning.

Mr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket. That book I must change for her.

—No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly. Later on please.

Mr Bloom's glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning the deaths: Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, what Peake is that? is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne's? no, Sexton, Urbright. Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper. Thanks to the Little Flower. Sadly missed. To the inexpressible grief of his. Aged 88 after a long and tedious illness. Month's mind: Quinlan. On whose soul Sweet Jesus have mercy.

It is now a month since dear Henry fled To his home up above in the sky While his family weeps and mourns his loss Hoping some day to meet him on high.

I tore up the envelope? Yes. Where did I put her letter after I read it in the bath? He patted his waistcoatpocket. There all right. Dear Henry fled. Before my patience are exhausted.

National school. Meade's yard. The hazard. Only two there now. Nodding. Full as a tick. Too much bone in their skulls. The other trotting round with a fare. An hour ago I was passing there. The jarvies raised their hats.

A pointsman's back straightened itself upright suddenly against a tramway standard by Mr Bloom's window. Couldn't they invent something automatic so that the wheel itself much handier? Well but that fellow would lose his job then? Well but then another fellow would get a job making the new invention?

Antient concert rooms. Nothing on there. A man in a buff suit with a crape armlet. Not much grief there. Quarter mourning. People in law perhaps.

They went past the bleak pulpit of saint Mark's, under the railway bridge, past the Queen's theatre: in silence. Hoardings: Eugene Stratton, Mrs Bandmann Palmer. Could I go to see LEAH tonight, I wonder. I said I. Or the Lily of Killarney? Elster Grimes Opera Company. Big powerful change. Wet bright bills for next week. Fun on the Bristol. Martin Cunningham could work a pass for the Gaiety. Have to stand a drink or two. As broad as it's long.

He's coming in the afternoon. Her songs.

Plasto's. Sir Philip Crampton's memorial fountain bust. Who was he?

—How do you do? Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow in salute.

—He doesn't see us, Mr Power said. Yes, he does. How do you do?

—Who? Mr Dedalus asked.

—Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said. There he is airing his quiff.

Just that moment I was thinking.

Mr Dedalus bent across to salute. From the door of the Red Bank the white disc of a straw hat flashed reply: spruce figure: passed.

Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right hand. The nails, yes. Is there anything more in him that they she sees? Fascination. Worst man in Dublin. That keeps him alive. They sometimes feel what a person is. Instinct. But a type like that. My nails. I am just looking at them: well pared. And after: thinking alone. Body getting a bit softy. I would notice that: from remembering. What causes that? I suppose the skin can't contract quickly enough when the flesh falls off. But the shape is there. The shape is there still. Shoulders. Hips. Plump. Night of the dance dressing. Shift stuck between the cheeks behind.

He clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant glance over their faces.

Mr Power asked:

—How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?

—O, very well, Mr Bloom said. I hear great accounts of it. It's a good idea, you see...

—Are you going yourself?

—Well no, Mr Bloom said. In point of fact I have to go down to the county Clare on some private business. You see the idea is to tour the chief towns. What you lose on one you can make up on the other.

—Quite so, Martin Cunningham said. Mary Anderson is up there now.

Have you good artists?

—Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said. O yes, we'll have all topnobbers. J. C. Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and. The best, in fact.

—And Madame, Mr Power said smiling. Last but not least.

Mr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and clasped them. Smith O'Brien. Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there. Woman. Must be his deathday. For many happy returns. The carriage wheeling by Farrell's statue united noiselessly their unresisting knees.

Oot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares, his mouth opening: oot.

—Four bootlaces for a penny.

Wonder why he was struck off the rolls. Had his office in Hume street. Same house as Molly's namesake, Tweedy, crown solicitor for Waterford. Has that silk hat ever since. Relics of old decency. Mourning too. Terrible comedown, poor wretch! Kicked about like snuff at a wake. O'Callaghan on his last legs.

And Madame. Twenty past eleven. Up. Mrs Fleming is in to clean. Doing her hair, humming. voglio e non vorrei. No. vorrei e non. Looking at the tips of her hairs to see if they are split. Mi trema un poco il. Beautiful on that tre her voice is: weeping tone. A thrush. A throstle. There is a word throstle that expresses that.

His eyes passed lightly over Mr Power's goodlooking face. Greyish over the ears. Madame: smiling. I smiled back. A smile goes a long way. Only politeness perhaps. Nice fellow. Who knows is that true about the woman he keeps? Not pleasant for the wife. Yet they say, who was it told me, there is no carnal. You would imagine that would get played out pretty quick. Yes, it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her a pound of rumpsteak. What is this she was? Barmaid in Jury's. Or the Moira, was it?

They passed under the hugecloaked Liberator's form.

Martin Cunningham nudged Mr Power.

—Of the tribe of Reuben, he said.

A tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner of Elvery's Elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his spine.

—In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said.

Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly:

—The devil break the hasp of your back!

Mr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as the carriage passed Gray's statue.

—We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly.

His eyes met Mr Bloom's eyes. He caressed his beard, adding:

—Well, nearly all of us.

Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions' faces.

—That's an awfully good one that's going the rounds about Reuben J and the son.

—About the boatman? Mr Power asked.

—Yes. Isn't it awfully good?

—What is that? Mr Dedalus asked. I didn't hear it.

—There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to send him to the Isle of Man out of harm's way but when they were both ...

—What? Mr Dedalus asked. That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?

—Yes, Mr Bloom said. They were both on the way to the boat and he tried to drown...

—Drown Barabbas! Mr Dedalus cried. I wish to Christ he did!

Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.

—No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself...

Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely:

—Reuben and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on their way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got loose and over the wall with him into the Liffey.

—For God's sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright. Is he dead?

—Dead! Martin Cunningham cried. Not he! A boatman got a pole and fished him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father on the quay more dead than alive. Half the town was there.

—Yes, Mr Bloom said. But the funny part is...

—And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin for saving his son's life.

A stifled sigh came from under Mr Power's hand.

—O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed. Like a hero. A silver florin.

—Isn't it awfully good? Mr Bloom said eagerly.

—One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily.

Mr Power's choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage.

Nelson's pillar.

—Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny!

—We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said.

Mr Dedalus sighed.

—Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn't grudge us a laugh. Many a good one he told himself.

—The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with his fingers. Poor Paddy! I little thought a week ago when I saw him last and he was in his usual health that I'd be driving after him like this. He's gone from us.

—As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said. He went very suddenly.

—Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said. Heart.

He tapped his chest sadly.

Blazing face: redhot. Too much John Barleycorn. Cure for a red nose. Drink like the devil till it turns adelite. A lot of money he spent colouring it.

Mr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension.

—He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said.

—The best death, Mr Bloom said.

Their wide open eyes looked at him.

—No suffering, he said. A moment and all is over. Like dying in sleep.

No-one spoke.

Dead side of the street this. Dull business by day, land agents, temperance hotel, Falconer's railway guide, civil service college, Gill's, catholic club, the industrious blind. Why? Some reason. Sun or wind. At night too. Chummies and slaveys. Under the patronage of the late Father Mathew. Foundation stone for Parnell. Breakdown. Heart.

White horses with white frontlet plumes came round the Rotunda corner, galloping. A tiny coffin flashed by. In a hurry to bury. A mourning coach. Unmarried. Black for the married. Piebald for bachelors. Dun for a nun.

—Sad, Martin Cunningham said. A child.

A dwarf's face, mauve and wrinkled like little Rudy's was. Dwarf's body, weak as putty, in a whitelined deal box. Burial friendly society pays. Penny a week for a sod of turf. Our. Little. Beggar. Baby. Meant nothing. Mistake of nature. If it's healthy it's from the mother. If not from the man. Better luck next time.

—Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said. It's well out of it.

The carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square. Rattle his bones. Over the stones. Only a pauper. Nobody owns.

—In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said.

—But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own life.

Martin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back.

—The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added.

—Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively. We must take a charitable view of it.

—They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said.

—It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said.

Mr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again. Martin Cunningham's large eyes. Looking away now. Sympathetic human man he is. Intelligent. Like Shakespeare's face. Always a good word to say. They have no mercy on that here or infanticide. Refuse christian burial. They used to drive a stake of wood through his heart in the grave. As if it wasn't broken already. Yet sometimes they repent too late. Found in the riverbed clutching rushes. He looked at me. And that awful drunkard of a wife of his. Setting up house for her time after time and then pawning the furniture on him every Saturday almost. Leading him the life of the damned. Wear the heart out of a stone, that. Monday morning. Start afresh. Shoulder to the wheel. Lord, she must have looked a sight that night Dedalus told me he was in there. Drunk about the place and capering with Martin's umbrella.

And they call me the jewel of Asia,
Of Asia,
The Geisha.

He looked away from me. He knows. Rattle his bones.

That afternoon of the inquest. The redlabelled bottle on the table. The room in the hotel with hunting pictures. Stuffy it was. Sunlight through the slats of the Venetian blind. The coroner's sunlit ears, big and hairy. Boots giving evidence. Thought he was asleep first. Then saw like yellow streaks on his face. Had slipped down to the foot of the bed. Verdict: overdose. Death by misadventure. The letter. For my son Leopold.

No more pain. Wake no more. Nobody owns.

The carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street. Over the stones.

—We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said.

—God grant he doesn't upset us on the road, Mr Power said.

—I hope not, Martin Cunningham said. That will be a great race tomorrow in Germany. The Gordon Bennett.

—Yes, by Jove, Mr Dedalus said. That will be worth seeing, faith.

As they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent over and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls. Has anybody here seen Kelly? Kay ee double ell wy. Dead March from Saul. He's as bad as old Antonio. He left me on my ownio. Pirouette! The Mater Misericordiae. Eccles street. My house down there. Big place. Ward for incurables there. Very encouraging. Our Lady's Hospice for the dying. Deadhouse handy underneath. Where old Mrs Riordan died. They look terrible the women. Her feeding cup and rubbing her mouth with the spoon. Then the screen round her bed for her to die. Nice young student that was dressed that bite the bee gave me. He's gone over to the lying-in hospital they told me. From one extreme to the other. The carriage galloped round a corner: stopped.

—What's wrong now?

A divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows, lowing, slouching by on padded hoofs, whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony croups. Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their fear.

—Emigrants, Mr Power said.

—Huuuh! the drover's voice cried, his switch sounding on their flanks.

Huuuh! out of that!

Thursday, of course. Tomorrow is killing day. Springers. Cuffe sold them about twentyseven quid each. For Liverpool probably. Roastbeef for old England. They buy up all the juicy ones. And then the fifth quarter lost: all that raw stuff, hide, hair, horns. Comes to a big thing in a year. Dead meat trade. Byproducts of the slaughterhouses for tanneries, soap, margarine. Wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off the train at Clonsilla.

The carriage moved on through the drove.

—I can't make out why the corporation doesn't run a tramline from the parkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said. All those animals could be taken in trucks down to the boats.

—Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said. Quite right. They ought to.

—Yes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought, is to have municipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know. Run the line out to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage and all. Don't you see what I mean?

—O, that be damned for a story, Mr Dedalus said. Pullman car and saloon diningroom.

—A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added.

—Why? Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus. Wouldn't it be more decent than galloping two abreast?

—Well, there's something in that, Mr Dedalus granted.

—And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn't have scenes like that when the hearse capsized round Dunphy's and upset the coffin on to the road.

—That was terrible, Mr Power's shocked face said, and the corpse fell about the road. Terrible!

—First round Dunphy's, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Gordon Bennett cup.

—Praises be to God! Martin Cunningham said piously.

Bom! Upset. A coffin bumped out on to the road. Burst open. Paddy Dignam shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too large for him. Red face: grey now. Mouth fallen open. Asking what's up now. Quite right to close it. Looks horrid open. Then the insides decompose quickly. Much better to close up all the orifices. Yes, also. With wax. The sphincter loose. Seal up all.

—Dunphy's, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right.

Dunphy's corner. Mourning coaches drawn up, drowning their grief. A pause by the wayside. Tiptop position for a pub. Expect we'll pull up here on the way back to drink his health. Pass round the consolation. Elixir of life.

But suppose now it did happen. Would he bleed if a nail say cut him in the knocking about? He would and he wouldn't, I suppose. Depends on where. The circulation stops. Still some might ooze out of an artery. It would be better to bury them in red: a dark red.

In silence they drove along Phibsborough road. An empty hearse trotted by, coming from the cemetery: looks relieved.

Crossguns bridge: the royal canal.

Water rushed roaring through the sluices. A man stood on his dropping barge, between clamps of turf. On the towpath by the lock a slacktethered horse. Aboard of the Bugabu.

Their eyes watched him. On the slow weedy waterway he had floated on his raft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of reeds, over slime, mudchoked bottles, carrion dogs. Athlone, Mullingar, Moyvalley, I could make a walking tour to see Milly by the canal. Or cycle down. Hire some old crock, safety. Wren had one the other day at the auction but a lady's. Developing waterways. James M'Cann's hobby to row me o'er the ferry. Cheaper transit. By easy stages. Houseboats. Camping out. Also hearses. To heaven by water. Perhaps I will without writing. Come as a surprise, Leixlip, Clonsilla. Dropping down lock by lock to Dublin. With turf from the midland bogs. Salute. He lifted his brown straw hat, saluting Paddy Dignam.

They drove on past Brian Boroimhe house. Near it now.

—I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on, Mr Power said.

—Better ask Tom Kernan, Mr Dedalus said.

—How is that? Martin Cunningham said. Left him weeping, I suppose?

—Though lost to sight, Mr Dedalus said, to memory dear.

The carriage steered left for Finglas road.

The stonecutter's yard on the right. Last lap. Crowded on the spit of land silent shapes appeared, white, sorrowful, holding out calm hands, knelt in grief, pointing. Fragments of shapes, hewn. In white silence: appealing. The best obtainable. Thos. H. Dennany, monumental builder and sculptor.

Passed.

On the curbstone before Jimmy Geary, the sexton's, an old tramp sat, grumbling, emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrown yawning boot. After life's journey.

Gloomy gardens then went by: one by one: gloomy houses.

Mr Power pointed.

—That is where Childs was murdered, he said. The last house.

—So it is, Mr Dedalus said. A gruesome case. Seymour Bushe got him off. Murdered his brother. Or so they said.

—The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said.

—Only circumstantial, Martin Cunningham added. That's the maxim of the law. Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent person to be wrongfully condemned.

They looked. Murderer's ground. It passed darkly. Shuttered, tenantless, unweeded garden. Whole place gone to hell. Wrongfully condemned. Murder. The murderer's image in the eye of the murdered. They love reading about it. Man's head found in a garden. Her clothing consisted of. How she met her death. Recent outrage. The weapon used. Murderer is still at large. Clues. A shoelace. The body to be exhumed. Murder will out.

Cramped in this carriage. She mightn't like me to come that way without letting her know. Must be careful about women. Catch them once with their pants down. Never forgive you after. Fifteen.

The high railings of Prospect rippled past their gaze. Dark poplars, rare white forms. Forms more frequent, white shapes thronged amid the trees, white forms and fragments streaming by mutely, sustaining vain gestures on the air.

The felly harshed against the curbstone: stopped. Martin Cunningham put out his arm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved the door open with his knee. He stepped out. Mr Power and Mr Dedalus followed.

Change that soap now. Mr Bloom's hand unbuttoned his hip pocket swiftly and transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief pocket. He stepped out of the carriage, replacing the newspaper his other hand still held.

Paltry funeral: coach and three carriages. It's all the same. Pallbearers, gold reins, requiem mass, firing a volley. Pomp of death. Beyond the hind carriage a hawker stood by his barrow of cakes and fruit. Simnel cakes those are, stuck together: cakes for the dead. Dogbiscuits. Who ate them? Mourners coming out.

He followed his companions. Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed, Hynes walking after them. Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse and took out the two wreaths. He handed one to the boy.

Where is that child's funeral disappeared to?

A team of horses passed from Finglas with toiling plodding tread, dragging through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a granite block. The waggoner marching at their head saluted.

Coffin now. Got here before us, dead as he is. Horse looking round at it with his plume skeowways. Dull eye: collar tight on his neck, pressing on a bloodvessel or something. Do they know what they cart out here every day? Must be twenty or thirty funerals every day. Then Mount Jerome for the protestants. Funerals all over the world everywhere every minute. Shovelling them under by the cartload doublequick. Thousands every hour. Too many in the world.

Mourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl. Leanjawed harpy, hard woman at a bargain, her bonnet awry. Girl's face stained with dirt and tears, holding the woman's arm, looking up at her for a sign to cry. Fish's face, bloodless and livid.

The mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates. So much dead weight. Felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath. First the stiff: then the friends of the stiff. Corny Kelleher and the boy followed with their wreaths. Who is that beside them? Ah, the brother-in-law.

All walked after.

Martin Cunningham whispered:

—I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom.

—What? Mr Power whispered. How so?

—His father poisoned himself, Martin Cunningham whispered. Had the Queen's hotel in Ennis. You heard him say he was going to Clare. Anniversary.

—O God! Mr Power whispered. First I heard of it. Poisoned himself?

He glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed towards the cardinal's mausoleum. Speaking.

—Was he insured? Mr Bloom asked.

—I believe so, Mr Kernan answered. But the policy was heavily mortgaged. Martin is trying to get the youngster into Artane.

—How many children did he leave?

—Five. Ned Lambert says he'll try to get one of the girls into Todd's.

—A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently. Five young children.

—A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added.

—Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed.

Has the laugh at him now.

He looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished. She had outlived him. Lost her husband. More dead for her than for me. One must outlive the other. Wise men say. There are more women than men in the world. Condole with her. Your terrible loss. I hope you'll soon follow him. For Hindu widows only. She would marry another. Him? No. Yet who knows after. Widowhood not the thing since the old queen died. Drawn on a guncarriage. Victoria and Albert. Frogmore memorial mourning. But in the end she put a few violets in her bonnet. Vain in her heart of hearts. All for a shadow. Consort not even a king. Her son was the substance. Something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back, waiting. It never comes. One must go first: alone, under the ground: and lie no more in her warm bed.

—How are you, Simon? Ned Lambert said softly, clasping hands. Haven't seen you for a month of Sundays.

—Never better. How are all in Cork's own town?

—I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday, Ned Lambert said. Same old six and eightpence. Stopped with Dick Tivy.

—And how is Dick, the solid man?

—Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered.

—By the holy Paul! Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder. Dick Tivy bald?

—Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned Lambert said, pointing ahead. A few bob a skull. Just to keep them going till the insurance is cleared up.

—Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously. Is that the eldest boy in front?

—Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wife's brother. John Henry Menton is behind. He put down his name for a quid.

—I'll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said. I often told poor Paddy he ought to mind that job. John Henry is not the worst in the world.

—How did he lose it? Ned Lambert asked. Liquor, what?

—Many a good man's fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh.

They halted about the door of the mortuary chapel. Mr Bloom stood behind the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and at the slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar. Poor boy! Was he there when the father? Both unconscious. Lighten up at the last moment and recognise for the last time. All he might have done. I owe three shillings to O'Grady. Would he understand? The mutes bore the coffin into the chapel. Which end is his head?

After a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened light. The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow candles at its corners. Always in front of us. Corny Kelleher, laying a wreath at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel. The mourners knelt here and there in prayingdesks. Mr Bloom stood behind near the font and, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it. He fitted his black hat gently on his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously.

A server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a door. The whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his stole with one hand, balancing with the other a little book against his toad's belly. Who'll read the book? I, said the rook.

They halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book with a fluent croak.

Father Coffey. I knew his name was like a coffin. Domine-namine. Bully about the muzzle he looks. Bosses the show. Muscular christian. Woe betide anyone that looks crooked at him: priest. Thou art Peter. Burst sideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will. With a belly on him like a poisoned pup. Most amusing expressions that man finds. Hhhn: burst sideways.

—Non intres in judicium cum servo tuo, Domine.

Makes them feel more important to be prayed over in Latin. Requiem mass. Crape weepers. Blackedged notepaper. Your name on the altarlist. Chilly place this. Want to feed well, sitting in there all the morning in the gloom kicking his heels waiting for the next please. Eyes of a toad too. What swells him up that way? Molly gets swelled after cabbage. Air of the place maybe. Looks full up of bad gas. Must be an infernal lot of bad gas round the place. Butchers, for instance: they get like raw beefsteaks. Who was telling me? Mervyn Browne. Down in the vaults of saint Werburgh's lovely old organ hundred and fifty they have to bore a hole in the coffins sometimes to let out the bad gas and burn it. Out it rushes: blue. One whiff of that and you're a goner.

My kneecap is hurting me. Ow. That's better.

The priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy's bucket and shook it over the coffin. Then he walked to the other end and shook it again. Then he came back and put it back in the bucket. As you were before you rested. It's all written down: he has to do it.

—Et ne nos inducas in tentationem.

The server piped the answers in the treble. I often thought it would be better to have boy servants. Up to fifteen or so. After that, of course ...

Holy water that was, I expect. Shaking sleep out of it. He must be fed up with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up. What harm if he could see what he was shaking it over. Every mortal day a fresh batch: middleaged men, old women, children, women dead in childbirth, men with beards, baldheaded businessmen, consumptive girls with little sparrows' breasts. All the year round he prayed the same thing over them all and shook water on top of them: sleep. On Dignam now.

—In paradisum.

Said he was going to paradise or is in paradise. Says that over everybody. Tiresome kind of a job. But he has to say something.

The priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server. Corny Kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoisted the coffin again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart. Corny Kelleher gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother-in-law. All followed them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air. Mr Bloom came last folding his paper again into his pocket. He gazed gravely at the ground till the coffincart wheeled off to the left. The metal wheels ground the gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt boots followed the trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres.

The ree the ra the ree the ra the roo. Lord, I mustn't lilt here.

—The O'Connell circle, Mr Dedalus said about him.

Mr Power's soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone.

—He's at rest, he said, in the middle of his people, old Dan O'. But his heart is buried in Rome. How many broken hearts are buried here, Simon!

—Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said. I'll soon be stretched beside her. Let Him take me whenever He likes.

Breaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little in his walk. Mr Power took his arm.

—She's better where she is, he said kindly.

—I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp. I suppose she is in heaven if there is a heaven.

Corny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to plod by.

—Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely.

Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head.

—The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said. I suppose we can do so too. We are the last. This cemetery is a treacherous place.

They covered their heads.

—The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly, don't you think? Mr Kernan said with reproof.

Mr Bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes. Secret eyes, secretsearching. Mason, I think: not sure. Beside him again. We are the last. In the same boat. Hope he'll say something else.

Mr Kernan added:

—The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler, more impressive I must say.

Mr Bloom gave prudent assent. The language of course was another thing.

Mr Kernan said with solemnity:

—I am the resurrection and the life. That touches a man's inmost heart.

—It does, Mr Bloom said.

Your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two with his toes to the daisies? No touching that. Seat of the affections. Broken heart. A pump after all, pumping thousands of gallons of blood every day. One fine day it gets bunged up: and there you are. Lots of them lying around here: lungs, hearts, livers. Old rusty pumps: damn the thing else. The resurrection and the life. Once you are dead you are dead. That last day idea. Knocking them all up out of their graves. Come forth, Lazarus! And he came fifth and lost the job. Get up! Last day! Then every fellow mousing around for his liver and his lights and the rest of his traps. Find damn all of himself that morning. Pennyweight of powder in a skull. Twelve grammes one pennyweight. Troy measure.

Corny Kelleher fell into step at their side.

—Everything went off A1, he said. What?

He looked on them from his drawling eye. Policeman's shoulders. With your tooraloom tooraloom.

—As it should be, Mr Kernan said.

—What? Eh? Corny Kelleher said.

Mr Kernan assured him.

—Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan? John Henry Menton asked. I know his face.

Ned Lambert glanced back.

—Bloom, he said, Madame Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, the soprano. She's his wife.

—O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said. I haven't seen her for some time. He was a finelooking woman. I danced with her, wait, fifteen seventeen golden years ago, at Mat Dillon's in Roundtown. And a good armful she was.

He looked behind through the others.

—What is he? he asked. What does he do? Wasn't he in the stationery line? I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls.

Ned Lambert smiled.

—Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Hely's. A traveller for blottingpaper.

—In God's name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a coon like that for? She had plenty of game in her then.

—Has still, Ned Lambert said. He does some canvassing for ads.

John Henry Menton's large eyes stared ahead.

The barrow turned into a side lane. A portly man, ambushed among the grasses, raised his hat in homage. The gravediggers touched their caps.

—John O'Connell, Mr Power said pleased. He never forgets a friend.

Mr O'Connell shook all their hands in silence. Mr Dedalus said:

—I am come to pay you another visit.

—My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice. I don't want your custom at all.

Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin Cunningham's side puzzling two long keys at his back.

—Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?

—I did not, Martin Cunningham said.

They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear. The caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles.

—They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggy evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs. They asked for Mulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried. After traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough. One of the drunks spelt out the name: Terence Mulcahy. The other drunk was blinking up at a statue of Our Saviour the widow had got put up.

The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed. He resumed:

—And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, Not a bloody bit like the man, says he. That's not Mulcahy, says he, whoever done it.

Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher, accepting the dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as he walked.

—That's all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes.

—I know, Hynes said. I know that.

—To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said. It's pure goodheartedness: damn the thing else.

Mr Bloom admired the caretaker's prosperous bulk. All want to be on good terms with him. Decent fellow, John O'Connell, real good sort. Keys: like Keyes's ad: no fear of anyone getting out. No passout checks. Habeas corpus. I must see about that ad after the funeral. Did I write Ballsbridge on the envelope I took to cover when she disturbed me writing to Martha? Hope it's not chucked in the dead letter office. Be the better of a shave. Grey sprouting beard. That's the first sign when the hairs come out grey. And temper getting cross. Silver threads among the grey. Fancy being his wife. Wonder he had the gumption to propose to any girl. Come out and live in the graveyard. Dangle that before her. It might thrill her first. Courting death... Shades of night hovering here with all the dead stretched about. The shadows of the tombs when churchyards yawn and Daniel O'Connell must be a descendant I suppose who is this used to say he was a queer breedy man great catholic all the same like a big giant in the dark. Will o' the wisp. Gas of graves. Want to keep her mind off it to conceive at all. Women especially are so touchy. Tell her a ghost story in bed to make her sleep. Have you ever seen a ghost? Well, I have. It was a pitchdark night. The clock was on the stroke of twelve. Still they'd kiss all right if properly keyed up. Whores in Turkish graveyards. Learn anything if taken young. You might pick up a young widow here. Men like that. Love among the tombstones. Romeo. Spice of pleasure. In the midst of death we are in life. Both ends meet. Tantalising for the poor dead. Smell of grilled beefsteaks to the starving. Gnawing their vitals. Desire to grig people. Molly wanting to do it at the window. Eight children he has anyway.

He has seen a fair share go under in his time, lying around him field after field. Holy fields. More room if they buried them standing. Sitting or kneeling you couldn't. Standing? His head might come up some day above ground in a landslip with his hand pointing. All honeycombed the ground must be: oblong cells. And very neat he keeps it too: trim grass and edgings. His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome. Well, so it is. Ought to be flowers of sleep. Chinese cemeteries with giant poppies growing produce the best opium Mastiansky told me. The Botanic Gardens are just over there. It's the blood sinking in the earth gives new life. Same idea those jews they said killed the christian boy. Every man his price. Well preserved fat corpse, gentleman, epicure, invaluable for fruit garden. A bargain. By carcass of William Wilkinson, auditor and accountant, lately deceased, three pounds thirteen and six. With thanks.

I daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure, bones, flesh, nails. Charnelhouses. Dreadful. Turning green and pink decomposing. Rot quick in damp earth. The lean old ones tougher. Then a kind of a tallowy kind of a cheesy. Then begin to get black, black treacle oozing out of them. Then dried up. Deathmoths. Of course the cells or whatever they are go on living. Changing about. Live for ever practically. Nothing to feed on feed on themselves.

But they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots. Soil must be simply swirling with them. Your head it simply swurls. Those pretty little seaside gurls. He looks cheerful enough over it. Gives him a sense of power seeing all the others go under first. Wonder how he looks at life. Cracking his jokes too: warms the cockles of his heart. The one about the bulletin. Spurgeon went to heaven 4 a.m. this morning. 11 p.m. (closing time). Not arrived yet. Peter. The dead themselves the men anyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know what's in fashion. A juicy pear or ladies' punch, hot, strong and sweet. Keep out the damp. You must laugh sometimes so better do it that way. Gravediggers in Hamlet. Shows the profound knowledge of the human heart. Daren't joke about the dead for two years at least. De mortuis nil nisi prius. Go out of mourning first. Hard to imagine his funeral. Seems a sort of a joke. Read your own obituary notice they say you live longer. Gives you second wind. New lease of life.

—How many have-you for tomorrow? the caretaker asked.

—Two, Corny Kelleher said. Half ten and eleven.

The caretaker put the papers in his pocket. The barrow had ceased to trundle. The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole, stepping with care round the graves. The gravediggers bore the coffin and set its nose on the brink, looping the bands round it.

Burying him. We come to bury Caesar. His ides of March or June. He doesn't know who is here nor care. Now who is that lankylooking galoot over there in the macintosh? Now who is he I'd like to know? Now I'd give a trifle to know who he is. Always someone turns up you never dreamt of. A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life. Yes, he could. Still he'd have to get someone to sod him after he died though he could dig his own grave. We all do. Only man buries. No, ants too. First thing strikes anybody. Bury the dead. Say Robinson Crusoe was true to life. Well then Friday buried him. Every Friday buries a Thursday if you come to look at it.

O, poor Robinson Crusoe!
How could you possibly do so?

Poor Dignam! His last lie on the earth in his box. When you think of them all it does seem a waste of wood. All gnawed through. They could invent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding, let it down that way. Ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellow's. They're so particular. Lay me in my native earth. Bit of clay from the holy land. Only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one coffin. I see what it means. I see. To protect him as long as possible even in the earth. The Irishman's house is his coffin. Embalming in catacombs, mummies the same idea.

Mr Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the bared heads. Twelve. I'm thirteen. No. The chap in the macintosh is thirteen. Death's number. Where the deuce did he pop out of? He wasn't in the chapel, that I'll swear. Silly superstition that about thirteen.

Nice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit. Tinge of purple. I had one like that when we lived in Lombard street west. Dressy fellow he was once. Used to change three suits in the day. Must get that grey suit of mine turned by Mesias. Hello. It's dyed. His wife I forgot he's not married or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for him.

The coffin dived out of sight, eased down by the men straddled on the gravetrestles. They struggled up and out: and all uncovered. Twenty.

Pause.

If we were all suddenly somebody else.

Far away a donkey brayed. Rain. No such ass. Never see a dead one, they say. Shame of death. They hide. Also poor papa went away.

Gentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper. Whisper. The boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in the black open space. Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly caretaker. Wellcut frockcoat. Weighing them up perhaps to see which will go next. Well, it is a long rest. Feel no more. It's the moment you feel. Must be damned unpleasant. Can't believe it at first. Mistake must be: someone else. Try the house opposite. Wait, I wanted to. I haven't yet. Then darkened deathchamber. Light they want. Whispering around you. Would you like to see a priest? Then rambling and wandering. Delirium all you hid all your life. The death struggle. His sleep is not natural. Press his lower eyelid. Watching is his nose pointed is his jaw sinking are the soles of his feet yellow. Pull the pillow away and finish it off on the floor since he's doomed. Devil in that picture of sinner's death showing him a woman. Dying to embrace her in his shirt. Last act of Lucia. Shall I nevermore behold thee? Bam! He expires. Gone at last. People talk about you a bit: forget you. Don't forget to pray for him. Remember him in your prayers. Even Parnell. Ivy day dying out. Then they follow: dropping into a hole, one after the other.

We are praying now for the repose of his soul. Hoping you're well and not in hell. Nice change of air. Out of the fryingpan of life into the fire of purgatory.

Does he ever think of the hole waiting for himself? They say you do when you shiver in the sun. Someone walking over it. Callboy's warning. Near you. Mine over there towards Finglas, the plot I bought. Mamma, poor mamma, and little Rudy.

The gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in on the coffin. Mr Bloom turned away his face. And if he was alive all the time? Whew! By jingo, that would be awful! No, no: he is dead, of course. Of course he is dead. Monday he died. They ought to have some law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or a telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole. Flag of distress. Three days. Rather long to keep them in summer. Just as well to get shut of them as soon as you are sure there's no.

The clay fell softer. Begin to be forgotten. Out of sight, out of mind.

The caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat. Had enough of it. The mourners took heart of grace, one by one, covering themselves without show. Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make its way deftly through the maze of graves. Quietly, sure of his ground, he traversed the dismal fields.

Hynes jotting down something in his notebook. Ah, the names. But he knows them all. No: coming to me.

—I am just taking the names, Hynes said below his breath. What is your christian name? I'm not sure.

—L, Mr Bloom said. Leopold. And you might put down M'Coy's name too. He asked me to.

—Charley, Hynes said writing. I know. He was on the Freeman once.

So he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne. Good idea a postmortem for doctors. Find out what they imagine they know. He died of a Tuesday. Got the run. Levanted with the cash of a few ads. Charley, you're my darling. That was why he asked me to. O well, does no harm. I saw to that, M'Coy. Thanks, old chap: much obliged. Leave him under an obligation: costs nothing.

—And tell us, Hynes said, do you know that fellow in the, fellow was over there in the...

He looked around.

—Macintosh. Yes, I saw him, Mr Bloom said. Where is he now?

—M'Intosh, Hynes said scribbling. I don't know who he is. Is that his name?

He moved away, looking about him.

—No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping. I say, Hynes!

Didn't hear. What? Where has he disappeared to? Not a sign. Well of all the. Has anybody here seen? Kay ee double ell. Become invisible. Good Lord, what became of him?

A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade.

—O, excuse me!

He stepped aside nimbly.

Clay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole. It rose. Nearly over. A mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested their spades. All uncovered again for a few instants. The boy propped his wreath against a corner: the brother-in-law his on a lump. The gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards the barrow. Then knocked the blades lightly on the turf: clean. One bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass. One, leaving his mates, walked slowly on with shouldered weapon, its blade blueglancing. Silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband. His navelcord. The brother-in-law, turning away, placed something in his free hand. Thanks in silence. Sorry, sir: trouble. Headshake. I know that. For yourselves just.

The mourners moved away slowly without aim, by devious paths, staying at whiles to read a name on a tomb.

—Let us go round by the chief's grave, Hynes said. We have time.

—Let us, Mr Power said.

They turned to the right, following their slow thoughts. With awe Mr Power's blank voice spoke:

—Some say he is not in that grave at all. That the coffin was filled with stones. That one day he will come again.

Hynes shook his head.

—Parnell will never come again, he said. He's there, all that was mortal of him. Peace to his ashes.

Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses, broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes, old Ireland's hearts and hands. More sensible to spend the money on some charity for the living. Pray for the repose of the soul of. Does anybody really? Plant him and have done with him. Like down a coalshoot. Then lump them together to save time. All souls' day. Twentyseventh I'll be at his grave. Ten shillings for the gardener. He keeps it free of weeds. Old man himself. Bent down double with his shears clipping. Near death's door. Who passed away. Who departed this life. As if they did it of their own accord. Got the shove, all of them. Who kicked the bucket. More interesting if they told you what they were. So and So, wheelwright. I travelled for cork lino. I paid five shillings in the pound. Or a woman's with her saucepan. I cooked good Irish stew. Eulogy in a country churchyard it ought to be that poem of whose is it Wordsworth or Thomas Campbell. Entered into rest the protestants put it. Old Dr Murren's. The great physician called him home. Well it's God's acre for them. Nice country residence. Newly plastered and painted. Ideal spot to have a quiet smoke and read the Church Times. Marriage ads they never try to beautify. Rusty wreaths hung on knobs, garlands of bronzefoil. Better value that for the money. Still, the flowers are more poetical. The other gets rather tiresome, never withering. Expresses nothing. Immortelles.

A bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch. Like stuffed. Like the wedding present alderman Hooper gave us. Hoo! Not a budge out of him. Knows there are no catapults to let fly at him. Dead animal even sadder. Silly-Milly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen matchbox, a daisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave.

The Sacred Heart that is: showing it. Heart on his sleeve. Ought to be sideways and red it should be painted like a real heart. Ireland was dedicated to it or whatever that. Seems anything but pleased. Why this infliction? Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket of fruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the boy. Apollo that was.

How many! All these here once walked round Dublin. Faithful departed. As you are now so once were we.

Besides how could you remember everybody? Eyes, walk, voice. Well, the voice, yes: gramophone. Have a gramophone in every grave or keep it in the house. After dinner on a Sunday. Put on poor old greatgrandfather. Kraahraark! Hellohellohello amawfullyglad kraark awfullygladaseeagain hellohello amawf krpthsth. Remind you of the voice like the photograph reminds you of the face. Otherwise you couldn't remember the face after fifteen years, say. For instance who? For instance some fellow that died when I was in Wisdom Hely's.

Rtststr! A rattle of pebbles. Wait. Stop!

He looked down intently into a stone crypt. Some animal. Wait. There he goes.

An obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt, moving the pebbles. An old stager: greatgrandfather: he knows the ropes. The grey alive crushed itself in under the plinth, wriggled itself in under it. Good hidingplace for treasure.

Who lives there? Are laid the remains of Robert Emery. Robert Emmet was buried here by torchlight, wasn't he? Making his rounds.

Tail gone now.

One of those chaps would make short work of a fellow. Pick the bones clean no matter who it was. Ordinary meat for them. A corpse is meat gone bad. Well and what's cheese? Corpse of milk. I read in that Voyages in China that the Chinese say a white man smells like a corpse. Cremation better. Priests dead against it. Devilling for the other firm. Wholesale burners and Dutch oven dealers. Time of the plague. Quicklime feverpits to eat them. Lethal chamber. Ashes to ashes. Or bury at sea. Where is that Parsee tower of silence? Eaten by birds. Earth, fire, water. Drowning they say is the pleasantest. See your whole life in a flash. But being brought back to life no. Can't bury in the air however. Out of a flying machine. Wonder does the news go about whenever a fresh one is let down. Underground communication. We learned that from them. Wouldn't be surprised. Regular square feed for them. Flies come before he's well dead. Got wind of Dignam. They wouldn't care about the smell of it. Saltwhite crumbling mush of corpse: smell, taste like raw white turnips.

The gates glimmered in front: still open. Back to the world again. Enough of this place. Brings you a bit nearer every time. Last time I was here was Mrs Sinico's funeral. Poor papa too. The love that kills. And even scraping up the earth at night with a lantern like that case I read of to get at fresh buried females or even putrefied with running gravesores. Give you the creeps after a bit. I will appear to you after death. You will see my ghost after death. My ghost will haunt you after death. There is another world after death named hell. I do not like that other world she wrote. No more do I. Plenty to see and hear and feel yet. Feel live warm beings near you. Let them sleep in their maggoty beds. They are not going to get me this innings. Warm beds: warm fullblooded life.

Martin Cunningham emerged from a sidepath, talking gravely.

Solicitor, I think. I know his face. Menton, John Henry, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits. Dignam used to be in his office. Mat Dillon's long ago. Jolly Mat. Convivial evenings. Cold fowl, cigars, the Tantalus glasses. Heart of gold really. Yes, Menton. Got his rag out that evening on the bowlinggreen because I sailed inside him. Pure fluke of mine: the bias. Why he took such a rooted dislike to me. Hate at first sight. Molly and Floey Dillon linked under the lilactree, laughing. Fellow always like that, mortified if women are by.

Got a dinge in the side of his hat. Carriage probably.

—Excuse me, sir, Mr Bloom said beside them.

They stopped.

—Your hat is a little crushed, Mr Bloom said pointing.

John Henry Menton stared at him for an instant without moving.

—There, Martin Cunningham helped, pointing also. John Henry Menton took off his hat, bulged out the dinge and smoothed the nap with care on his coatsleeve. He clapped the hat on his head again.

—It's all right now, Martin Cunningham said.

John Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment.

—Thank you, he said shortly.

They walked on towards the gates. Mr Bloom, chapfallen, drew behind a few paces so as not to overhear. Martin laying down the law. Martin could wind a sappyhead like that round his little finger, without his seeing it.

Oyster eyes. Never mind. Be sorry after perhaps when it dawns on him. Get the pull over him that way.

Thank you. How grand we are this morning!



I never meant to be so bad to you
One thing I said that I would never do
A look from you and I would fall from grace
And that would wipe the smile right from my face

Do you remember when we used to dance?
And incidents arose from circumstance
One thing led to another, we were young
And we would scream together songs unsung

It was the heat of the moment
Telling me what my heart meant
The heat of the moment showed in your eyes

And now you find yourself in Eighty Two
The disco hot spots hold no charm for you
You can concern yourself with bigger things
You catch a pearl and ride the dragon's wings

Cause it's the heat of the moment
Heat of the moment
The heat of the moment showed in your eyes

And when your looks are gone and you're alone
How many nights you sit beside the phone
What were the things you wanted for yourself?
Teenage ambitions you remember well

It was the heat of the moment
Telling me what your heart meant
The heat of the moment showed in your eyes

Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment showed in your eyes

Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment



You're leaving now
It's in your eyes
There's no disguising it
It really comes as no surprise
To find that you'd planned it all along

I see it now
It comes so clear
Your insincerity
And me all starry eyed
You think that I would have known by now

Now, sure as the sun will cross the sky
This lie is over
Lost, like the tears that used to tide me over

One thing is sure
That time will tell
If you were wrong
The brightest ring around the moon
Will darken when I die

Now, sure as the sun will cross the sky
This lie is over
Gone, like the tears that used to tide me over

You're leaving now
It's in your eyes
There's no disguising it
It really comes as no surprise
To find that you'd planned it all along

I see it now
It comes so clear
Your insincerity
And me all starry eyed
You think that I would have known by now

Now, sure as the sun will cross the sky
This lie is over
Lost, like the tears that used to tide me over

You're on your own
Inside your room
You're claiming victory
You were just using me
And there is no one you can use now

One thing is sure
That time will tell...



When you walked into the room
There was voodoo in the vibes
I was captured by your style
But I could not catch your eyes
Now I stand here helplessly
Hoping you'll get into me

I am so into you
I can't think of nothing else
I am so into you
I can't think of nothing else

Thinking how it's going to be
Whenever I get you next to me
It's gonna be good, dont you know
From your head to your toe
Gonna love you all over, over and over
Me into you, you into me, me into you

I am so into you
I am so into you, ooh

When you walked into the room
There was voodoo in the vibes
I was captured by your style
But I could not catch your eyes
Now I stand here helplessly
Hoping you'll get into me

I am so into you
I can't get to nothing else
I am so into you baby
I can't get to nothing else
No no no come on baby
I am so into you
Love the things you do

Listen baby
Driving me crazy, oooh
Come on baby, oo-ooh
I am so into you
Love the things you do
Come on baby
I am so into you
I am so into you
I am so into you



In the cool of the evening
When everything is gettin kind of groovy
I call you up and ask you if you
Would you like to go with me and see a movie
First you say no, you've got some plans for the night
And then you stop, and say, all right
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little girl like you

You always keep me guessin
I never seem to know what you are thinkin
And if a fella looks at you
It's for sure your little eye will be a-winkin
I get confused, cause I don't know where I stand
And then you smile, and hold my hand
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little girl like you
Spooky
Spooky

If you decide someday to stop this little game that you are playin
I'm gonna tell you all what my heart's been a-dyin to be sayin
Just like a ghost, you've been a-hauntin my dreams
So I'll propose on Halloween
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little girl like you

Spooky, spooky, oh whoa, all right
Spooky, oh yea yea
I said Spooky yea yea



[Verse 1]
On a cobweb afternoon in a room full of emptiness
By a freeway, I confess I was lost in the pages
Of a book full of death, reading how we'll die alone
And if we're good, we'll lay to rest anywhere we want to go

[Chorus]
In your house I long to be
Room by room patiently
I'll wait for you there, like a stone
I'll wait for you there, alone

[Verse 2]
And on my deathbed I will pray to the gods and the angels
Like a pagan to anyone who will take me to heaven
To a place I recall, I was there so long ago
The sky was bruised, the wine was bled, and there you led me on

[Chorus]
In your house I long to be
Room by room patiently
I'll wait for you there, like a stone
I'll wait for you there, alone, alone

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
And on I read, until the day was gone
And I sat in regret of all the things I've done
For all that I've blessed, and all that I've wronged
In dreams until my death, I will wander on

[Chorus]
In your house I long to be
Room by room patiently
I'll wait for you there, like a stone
I'll wait for you there, alone, alone



Wooh, hey what's that?
Blondes in black cars, yeah
Burning up the boulevard, ow
Blondes in black cars
And they're here for me, yeah

Blondes in black cars, wooh
Burning up the boulevard, yeah
Blondes in black cars
And they're here for me

It was a regular Saturday night
Bored to tears I was feelin' uptight
I needed somethin' to change the scene

So I found a corner to call my own
I struck it plain in the crusin' zone
I was ready to find the American dream

Then from the distance I saw a light
Just like a vision breakin' through the night
All I could see was this beautiful sight

It was blondes in black cars, wooh
Burning up the boulevard
Blondes in black cars
And they're here for me

Blondes in black cars, alright
Burning up the boulevard, ow
Blondes in black cars
And they're here for me

It's like a picture from a magazine
Everybody's trying to make the scene
I gotta get into the game

I can imagine how it's got to feel
With a beautiful blonde in my automobile
I know I'd never be the same

Then from the distance I saw a light
Just like a vision breakin' through the night
All I could see was this beautiful sight

It was blondes in black cars, ow
Burning up the boulevard, wooh
Blondes in black cars
And they're here for me, I can't believe it

Blondes in black cars, ow
Burning up the boulevard, yeah
Blondes in black cars
And they're here for me

Wooh, hey take a look at that one
Hey baby, hey come on over here one time
Hey what's happenin' baby
Wait, hey, hey where you goin'

Blondes in black cars, ow
Burning up the boulevard, yeah
Blondes in black cars
And they're here for me

Wooh, blondes in black cars, yeah
Burning up the boulevard, ow
Blondes in black cars, well alright
Burning up the boulevard, oww

Blondes in black cars
Burning up the boulevard
Blondes in black cars

Ooh yeah
Turn it up
Come on

I'm working hard, you're working too
We do it every day
For every minute I have to work
I need a minute of play

Day in, day out, all week long
Things go better with rock
The only time I turn it down
Is when I'm sleepin' it off

Turn up the radio
I need the music, gimme some more
Turn up the radio
I wanna feel it, got to gimmie some more

Now listen
I wanna shake, I wanna dance
So count it of one, two, three
I hear the beat, I'm in a trance
No better place to be

Daytime, nighttime, anytime
Things go better with rock
I'm goin' twenty four hours a day
I can't seem to stop

Turn up the radio
I need the music, gimme some more
Turn up the radio
I wanna feel it, got to gimmie some more

Turn up the radio

I know, you know this ain't gonna last forever
Let's take advantage while we still can
I'm sure that you'll find the days couldn't get any longer
Day after day it's gettin' old fast

Let's have a knock down, drag out rock 'n' roll party in the streets
Get all the boys together have them tell everybody that they meet
Friday night at midnight we're all gonna get what we need
Let's have a knock down, drag out rock 'n' roll party in the streets

You know, I know we ain't gonna show no mercy
To anyone that tries to get in our way
I'm sure that you'll find we got to put the word out for certain
Once the party gets started we're all here to stay

Let's have a knock down, drag out rock 'n' roll party in the streets
Get all the boys together have them tell everybody that they meet
Friday night at midnight we're all gonna get what we need
Let's have a knock down, drag out rock 'n' roll party in the streets

Let's have a knock down, drag out rock 'n' roll party in the streets
Get all the boys together have them tell everybody that they meet
Friday night at midnight we're all gonna get what we need
Let's have a knock down, drag out rock 'n' roll party in the streets

Let's have a knock down, drag out rock 'n' roll party in the streets
Get all the boys together have them tell everybody that they meet
Friday night at midnight we're all gonna get what we need

{Intro}

Goodbye, hard life
Don't cry, would you let it ride?
Goodbye, hard life
Don't cry, would you let it ride?

{hook}

You can see the mornin', but I can see the light
Try, try, try, let it ride
While you've been out runnin', I've been waitin' half the night
Try, try, try, let it ride

And would you cry if I told you that I lied?
And would you say goodbye or would you let it ride?
And would you cry if I told you that I lied?
And would you say goodbye or would you let it ride?

Seems my life is not complete, I never see you smile
Try, try, try, let it ride
Baby you want the forgivin' kind, and that's just not my style
Try, try, try, let it ride

And would you cry if I told you that I lied?
And would you say goodbye or would you let it ride?
And would you cry if I told you that I lied?
And would you say goodbye or would you let it ride?

{Bridge}

I've been doin' things worthwhile, and you've been bookin' time
Try, try, try, let it ride

And would you cry if I told you that I lied?
And would you say goodbye, would you let it ride?
And would you cry if I told you that I lied?
And would you say goodbye or would you let it ride?

Would you let it ride?
Would you let it ride?
Would you let it ride?
Would you let it ride?

Try, try, try, let it ride
Try, try, try, let it ride
Try, try, try, let it ride
Try, try, try, let it ride

Try, try, try, let it ride
Try, try, try, let it ride
Try, try, try, let it ride
Try, try, try, let it ride
Try, try, try, let it ride

Would you let it ride?
Would you let it ride?
Would you let it ride?
Would you let it ride?

{Outro}



We rented a truck and a semi to go
Travel down the long and winding road
Look on the map I think we've been here before
Close the doors let's roll once more
Cop on the corner, look he's startin' to write
I don't need no ticket so I screamed out of sight
Drove so fast that my eyes can't see
Look in the mirror is he still followin' me?
Let it roll down the highway
Let it roll down the highway
Roll, roll

Look at the sign, we're in the wrong place
Come on boys, let's get ready to race
454 coming over the hill
The man on patrol, is going to give us a bill
The time's real short, you know the distance is long
I'd rather have a jet but it's not in the song
Climb back in the cab, cross your fingers for luck
We gotta keep movie' if we're going to make a buck
Let it roll down the highway



You get up every morning from alarm clock's warning
Take the eight-fifteen into the city
There's a whistle up above and people pushing, people shoving
And the girls who try to look pretty

And if your train's on time, you can get to work by nine
And start your slavin' jobs and get your pay
If you ever get annoyed, look at me, I'm self-employed
I love to work at nothing all day

And I've been takin' care of business, every day
Takin' care of business, every way
I've been takin' care of business, it's all mine
Takin' care of business and working overtime, work out
Whoo

If it were easy as fishing, you could be a musician
If you could make sounds loud or mellow
Get a secondhand guitar, chances are you'll go far
If you get in with the right bunch of fellows

People see you having fun just a-lying in the sun
You tell them that you like it this way
It's the work that we avoid and we're all self-employed
We love to work at nothing all day

And we've been takin' care of business, every day
Takin' care of business, every way
We've been takin' care of business, it's all mine
Takin' care of business and working overtime
Funky

Whoo
All right, ow!
I love it!

Take good care of my business
When I'm away, every day
Whoo!
(Ha ha, whoo hoo, oh yeah)

You get up every morning from alarm clock's warning
Take the eight-fifteen into the city
There's a whistle up above and people pushing, people shoving
And the girls who try to look pretty

And if your train's on time, you can get to work by nine
And start your slavin' jobs and get your pay
If you ever get annoyed, look at me, I'm self-employed
I love to work at nothing all day

And I've been takin' care of business, every day
Takin' care of business, every way
I've been takin' care of business, it's all mine
Takin' care of business and working overtime, take care

Takin' care of business, whoo!
Takin' care of business
Takin' care of business, yo
Takin' care of business

Takin' care of business, every day
Takin' care of business, every way
Takin' care of business, it's all mine
Takin' care of business, working overtime, whoo!

Takin' care of business
Takin' care of business
We've been takin' care of business
We've been takin' care of business, whoo!

Takin' care of business
Takin' care of business
Takin' care of business



I met a devil woman
She took my heart away
She said, I've had it comin' to me
But I wanted it that way
I say that any love is good lovin'
So I took what I could get
She looked at me with them brown eyes
And said, You ain't seen nothin' yet
B-B-B-Baby, you just ain't seen n-n-n-nothin' yet
Here's something that you're never gonna forget
B-B-B-Baby, you just ain't seen n-n-n-nothin' yet
And you're thinkin' you ain't been around, that's right
And now I'm feelin' better
'Cause I found out for sure
She took me to her doctor
And he told me of a cure
He said that any love is good love
So I took what I could get, yes, I took what I could get
And then she looked at me with them big brown eyes
And said, You ain't seen nothin' yet
B-B-B-Baby, you just ain't seen n-n-n-nothin' yet
Here's something, here's something
That you're never gonna forget, baby
B-B-B-Baby, you know, you know, you know
You just ain't seen nothin' yet
You need an education, got to go to school
Any lovin' is good lovin'
So I took what I could get
Yes I took what I could get
And then, and then, and then
She looked at me with them big brown eyes
And said, you ain't seen nothin' yet
Baby, you just ain't seen n-n-n-nothin' yet
Here's something, here's something
Here's a lover you're never gonna forget, baby
B-B-B-Baby, you just ain't seen n-n-n-nothin' yet
You ain't been around
You ain't seen nothin' yet, that's what she told me
She said, I need an education, go to school
I know I ain't seen nothin' yet
I know I ain't seen nothin' yet, mmh, mmh, mmh
I got something for you right now
Feels good, alright, how do you do that
But I ain't seen nothin' yet
But I deserve it one of these days
But I ain't seen nothin' yet
I ain't seen nothin' yet
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I ain't seen nothin' yet, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait
If you want to show me
What I ain't seen, where I ain't been



Company, always on the run
Destiny is the rising sun
Oh, I was born 6-gun in my hand
Behind a gun I'll make my final stand
That's why they call me

Bad company
And I can't deny
Bad company
Till the day I die
Oh, till the day I die
Till the day I die

Rebel souls, deserters we are called
Chose a gun and threw away the sun
Now these towns, they all know our name
6-gun sound is our claim to fame
I can hear them say

Bad company
And I won't deny
Bad, bad company
Till the day I die, oo yeah
Till the day I die, oo

Hey
Bad company
And I can't deny
Bad company
Till the day I die

And I say it's
Bad company, oh yeah yeah
Bad company
Till the day I die, oh yeah

Tell me that you are not a thief
Oh but I am bad company
It's the way I play dirty for dirty
Oh, somebody double-crossed me
Double-cross, double-cross

Yeah, we're bad company



The sky is burnin'
I believe my soul's on fire
You are, I'm learnin', the key to my desire

Waiting for the van to arrive
The prisoners were lined up outside
Jumped a wall, hitched a ride, and now I'm here to stay
Love you baby anyway

The sky is burnin'
I believe my soul's on fire
You are, I'm learnin', the key to my desire

Ran across the country fields in all the rain
They had guns and dogs and everything
Swam the river tryin' to lose my trail
But they caught me; under the bridge, whoa yeah!

The sky is burnin'
I believe my soul's on fire
You are, I'm learnin', the key to my desire, oh yeah

Oh, yeah

The sky is burnin'
I believe my soul's on fire
You are, I'm learnin', the key to my desire

The judge said this man's a danger to humanity
We're gonna lock him up and throw away the key
Now baby, your love has sent me to jail
But I'd rather die than see you with another man
Yeah it's burnin', baby
Mmm mmmm

I believe my soul's on fire
I believe my soul's on fire

Working on the railroad every day
But they can't keep me here
And I'm not gonna stay
I got to get outta this place
Out to see you, baby
Yeah it's burnin'
Yeah, burnin'
I believe my soul's on fire
Oh, burnin'
Ah, yeah, ah oh ...



Hey hey, I can't get enough, hey hey
Hey hey, I can't get enough, hey hey
You don't make it easy, you never keep it straight
But you're so damn sexy, I can't keep away
I need your love, I need your skin
I need you baby to let me in
I can't get enough of you baby
I can't get enough, it's never enough
I can't get enough, I'm still hungry
Baby, give it up 'cause I can't get enough
It's alright, it feels good
When I'm in your chains, it's understood
That you're my owner, my only will
Come and get me while I'm quiet and still
I can't get enough of you baby
I can't get enough, it's never enough
I can't get enough, I'm still hungry
Baby, give it up, don't you know

Can't get enough of you baby
Never enough, do you want to give me some?
Can't get enough, don't keep me waiting
Never enough

When I'm in your chains, it's understood
And my soul confession, Devil's due
Come and get me girl, it's up to you
I can't get enough of you baby
I can't get enough, it's never enough
I can't get enough, I'm still hungry
Baby, give it up, don't you know

Can't get enough



[Verse 1]
Baby, when I think about you
Think about love

On the way

Feel like makin'
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love

Of satisfyin'

Feel like makin'
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love

I don't know if I'll die laughin'

Well I'm gonna miss your lovin
And your perfume and your smile
I'm gonna miss your stealin all my booze

If I hear you knocking hard up on my door
Ain't no way that I'm gonna answer it
'Cos cheating is one thing and lying is another
And when I say it's over that's it I'm gonna quit, yeah

Now I ain't complaining, just tryin' to understand
What makes a woman do the things she does?
One day she'll love you the next day she'll leave you
Why can't we have it just the way it used to be?

Why can't we have it, baby?

'Cos I'm a man, I got my pride
Don't need no woman to hurt me inside
I need a love like any other
So go on and leave me, leave me for another

Good lovin' gone bad
Good lovin' gone bad, bad, bad
Good lovin' gone bad
And baby, I'm a bad man

Now I'm a man, I got my pride

And baby, I'm a bad man

Good lovin' gone bad
Good lovin' gone bad
Good lovin' gone bad; I'm a sad man
Don't stand in my way 'cause baby, I'm a bad man



I get up in the morning and it's just another day
Pack up my belongings, I've got to get away
Jump into a taxi and the time is gettin' tight
I got to keep on movin' I got a show tonight

And I'm movin' on, movin' on from town to town
Movin' on, baby, yeah I'm never touchin' the ground

Yeah. I check into the ticket desk with half an' hour to go
Headin' for the boarding gate, I'm feelin' pretty low
Fifteen minutes later, I'm sittin' on my plane
Fastened in my safety belt I'm takin' off again

And I'm movin' on, movin' on from town to town
Movin' on, baby, yeah I'm never touchin' the ground

And I'm movin' on, movin' on from town to town
Movin' on, I can't seem to stop now

I got to move on, move on from town to town
I got to move on, and I never seem to slow down
Oh, I got to move on, move on from town to town
I got to move on, I never seem to slow down, oh yeah

Everyday of my life I am movin on



Walkin' down this rocky road
Wondering where my life is leadin'
Rollin' on to the bitter end
Finding out along the way
What it takes to keep love living
You should know how it feels, my friend

Ooh, I want you to stay
Ooh, I want you today

I'm ready for love
Oh baby, I'm ready for love
Ready for love
Oh baby, I'm ready for love
Yeah, ooh
For your love

Now I'm on my feet again
Better things are bound to happen
All my dues surely must be paid
Many miles and many tears
Times were hard but now they're changing
You should know that I'm not afraid

Ooh, I want you to stay
Ooh, I want you today

I'm ready for love
Oh baby, I'm ready for love
Ready for love
Oh baby, I'm ready for love
Oh I'm ready for love
I'm ready for your love

Ooh, I want you to stay

And I love to see the crowd
Dancing in the aisles
And singin' out loud, yeah

It's all part of my rock and roll dream

You never give me my money
You only give me your sympathy
'Cause I keep on running
There's no way to catch up with me
I'm leaving you, don't make no fuss;
You won't even see me, oh no, for dust

I'm running with the pack
Running with the pack
I'm running with the pack
Never looking back

You try to keep me in cages
But baby, you got to catch me first
You think your law is contagious
I'll do my best, you can do your worst
I'm leaving you, now who can I trust;
You won't even see me, oh no, for dust

I'm running with the pack
Running with the pack
I'm running with the pack
Never looking back

All right

Look out there

Running with the pack

Never looking back

Running with the pack

Running with the pack
Never looking back
Oh, yeah

You can't hold me back

On my own way
Running with the pack, ooh
Never, never, never looking back, Oh
Keep on running, keep on running
Yeah, yeah
Moving on, moving out
Oh, oh......

Into the misty morning sun
Nobody asks you where you are going
Nobody knows where you're from

Here is a man asking the question
Is this really the end of the world?

The shape of things to come
Now you fly, through the sky, never asking why
And you fly all around 'til somebody, Shoots you down

Da da da da da da da down
Mm mm mm mm, mm mm

Seagull, you fly, across the horizon

And you fly away tomorrow
And you fly away, leave me to
My sorrow

Johnny was a schoolboy when he heard his first Beatles song
'Love Me Do,' I think it was. From there it didn't take him long
Got himself a guitar, used to play every night
Now he's in a rock 'n' roll outfit and everything's all right

Don't you know?

Johnny told his mama, "Hey, Mama, I'm goin' away
I'm gonna hit the big time, gonna be a big star someday."
Mama came to the door with a teardrop in her eye
Johnny said, "Don't cry, Mama," smiled and waved good-bye

Don't you know, yeah yeah, Don't you know that you are a shooting star
Don't you know, don't you know. Don't you know that you are
A shooting star
And all the world will love you just as long
As long as you are

Johnny made a record, went straight up to number one
Suddenly everyone loved to hear him sing the song
Watching the world go by, surprising it goes so fast
Johnny looked around him and said, 'Well, I made the big time at last'

Don't you know, don't you know, don't you know that you are
A shooting star
Don't you know, oh, yeah, don't you know that you are
A shooting star, yeah
And all the world will love you just as long
As long as you are, a shooting star

Don't you know that you are a shooting star, Don't you know, yeah
Don't you know that you are a shooting star, now
And all the world will love you just as long, As long you are you

Johnny died one night, died in his bed
Bottle of whiskey, sleeping tablets by his head
Johnny's life passed him by like a warm summer day
If you listen to the wind, you can still hear him play

Oh oh oh, Don't you know that you are a shooting star
Don't you know, yeah, don't you know', Don't you know that
You are a shooting star
Don't you know, yeah

Yeah, a shooting star, yeah, oh
Oh oh oh oh......
Don't you, don't you know
That you are a shooting star
Don't you don't you know......



In the beginning, I believed every word that you said
Now that you're gone my world is in shreds
Oh, you loved me and left me
You took all the things that I needed so bad
I'm standing here wondering where is the love that I had?
Oh, give me silver, blue and gold
The colour of the sky I'm told
My ray-ay-ain-bow is overdue

In the beginning, yeah
There was something of love that was mine
Now that it's gone, whoa, I'm cryin'

Oh, the time that it takes for a love
To grow cold is a wonder to me
I'm walkin' around with my head
Hangin' down, tell me where is she?

Give me silver, blue and gold
The colour of the sky I'm told
My ray-ay-ain-bow is overdue

Don't forsake me 'cause I love you
Don't forsake me 'cause I love you
Give me silver, blue and gold
The colour of the sky I'm told
My ray-ay-ain-bow is overdue
Give me silver, blue and gold
The colour of the sky I'm told
My ray-ay-ain-bow is overdue
Now, give me silver, blue and gold
The colour of the sky I'm told
My ray-ay-ain-bow is overdue, yeah

Oh, don't forsake me 'cause I love you
Don't forsake me 'cause I love you, yeah



Sometimes I wonder
How I'd ever make it through
Through this world without having you
I just wouldn't have a clue

'Cause sometimes it seems
Like this world is closing in on me
And there's no way of breaking free
And then I see you reach for me

Sometimes I want to give up, wanna give in
I wanna quit the fight
And then I see you, baby
And everything's alright
Everything's alright

When I see you smile, I can face the world
Oh, you know I can do anything
When I see you smile, see a ray of light
Oh, see it shining right through the rain
When I see you smile
Baby, when I see you smile at me

Oh yeah

Baby, there's nothing
In this world that could ever do
What the touch of your hand can do
It's like nothing that I ever knew
Hey

And when the rain is falling I don't feel it
'Cause you're here with me now
I want your answer baby
It's all I'll ever need
It's all I'll ever need

When I see you smile, I can face the world
Oh, you know I can do anything
When I see you smile, I see a ray of light
Oh, I see it shining right through the rain
When I see you smile, baby
Baby, when I see you smile at me

Sometimes I want to give up
I wanna give in, I wanna quit the fight
Then one look at you, baby
And everything's alright
Hey, everything's alright, so right

When I see you smile, I can face the world
Oh, you know I can do anything, yeah
When I see you smile, I see a ray of light
Oh, I see it shining right through the rain, yeah

When I see you smile, yeah, I can face the world
Oh, you know I can do anything now
When I see you smile, oh yeah
Baby, when I see you smile
Smile at me



No matter what you are
I will always be with you
Doesn't matter what you do, girl
Ooh girl, with you

No matter what you do
I will always be around
Won't you tell me what you found, girl
Ooh girl, want you

Knock down the old grey wall
Be a part of it all
Nothing to say, nothing to see, nothing to do
If you would give me all
As I would give it to you
Nothing would be, nothing would be, nothing would be

No matter where you go
There will always be a place
Can't you see it in my face, girl
Ooh girl, want you

Knock down the old grey wall
Be a part of it all
Nothing to say, nothing to see, nothing to do
If you would give me all
As I would give it to you
Nothing would be, nothing would be, nothing would be

No matter what you are
I will always be with you
Doesn't matter what you do, girl
Ooh girl, with you
Ooh girl, you girl, want you
Ooh girl, you girl, want you



Mmm, yeah
Oh...

High-strung girl, gotta sing for your supper
Ten feet tall, best get you down to size
Now I don't know what makes you think you're so special
See, someday soon you're gonna realize
Sticks and stones can break your bones
But broken hearts can shake your soul

Bad break, no escape
Coulda got away, Lord, you know I should've
Oh, no, she walks like a woman
Cool eyes, electric thighs
Tried to find her heart, but you know I couldn't
Oh, no, she walks like a woman
But she acts like a little girl
Acts like a little girl

I know you think that life's for the taking
Satin sheets caress you in the night
Someday soon be a big rude awaking
Now everything can change before your eyes
Tell me, will your garden grow
If the sun don't shine and no one's home

Bad break, no escape
Coulda got away, Lord, you know I should've
Oh, no, she walks like a woman
Cool eyes, electric thighs
Tried to find her heart, but you know I couldn't
Oh, no, she walks like a woman
But she acts like a little girl

I'm getting real tired of your nursery rhymes
Kinda makes me feel like I'm doing time

Bad break, no escape
Coulda got away, Lord, you know I should've
Oh, no, she walks like a woman
Cool eyes, electric thighs
Tried to find her heart, but you know I couldn't
Oh, no, she walks like a woman
But she acts like a little girl

Bad break, no escape
Coulda got away, Lord, you know I should've
Oh, no, she walks like a woman
Cool eyes, electric thighs
Tried to find her heart, but you know I couldn't
Oh, no, she walks like a woman
But she acts like a little girl



Kick it!

You wake up late for school, man, you don't wanna go
You ask your mom, "Please?" but she still says "No!"
You missed two classes and no homework
But your teacher preaches class like you're some kinda jerk

You gotta fight
For your right
To party

Your pop's caught you smokin', man, and he says "No way."
That hypocrite smokes two packs a day
Man, livin' at home is such a drag
Now your mom threw away your best porno mag
Busted!

You gotta fight
For your right
To party

You gotta fight

Don't step out of this house if that's the clothes you're gonna wear
I'll kick you out of my home if you don't cut that hair
Your mom busted in and said "What's that noise?"
Aw, mom, you're just jealous, it's the Beastie Boys

You gotta fight
For your right
To party
You gotta fight
For your right
To party

Party
Party



[Chorus]
No sleep till
Brooklyn

[Verse 1: Ad-Rock, Mike D & MCA]
Foot on the pedal, never ever false metal
Engine running hotter than a boiling kettle
My job's ain't a job, it's a damn good time
City to city, I'm running my rhymes
On location, touring around the nation
Beastie Boys always on vacation
Itchy trigger finger but a stable turntable
I do what I do best because I'm illing and able
Ain't no faking, your money I'm taking
Going coast to coast watching all the girlies shaking
While you're at the job working nine-to-five
The Beastie Boys at the Garden cold kicking it live

[Chorus]
No sleep till
Another plane, another train
Another bottle in the brain
Another girl, another fight
Another drive all night

[Verse 2: Mike D, MCA & Ad Rock]
Our manager's crazy, he always smokes dust
He's got his own room at the back of the bus
Tour around the world, you rock around the clock
Plane to hotel, girls on the jock
We're trashing hotels like it's going out of style
Getting paid along the way 'cause it's worth your while
Four on the floor, Ad-Rock's out the door
MCA's in the back 'cause he's sleeping with a whore
We got a safe in the trunk with money in a stack
With dice in the front and Brooklyn's in the back
White boys got more rhymes

[Chorus]
No sleep till
No sleep till Brooklyn
No sleep till Brooklyn

[Ad-Lib: Ad Rock]
Ain't seen the light since we started this band
So, MCA, get on the mic, my man!

[Verse 3: MCA, Mike D & Ad Rock]
Born and bred Brooklyn USA
They call me Adam Yauch but I'm MCA
Like a lemon to a lime, a lime to a lemon
I sip the def ale with all the fly women
Got limos, arena, and TV shows
Autograph pictures and classy hoes
Step off, Holmes, get out of my way!
Taxing little girlies from here to L.A.
Waking up before I get to sleep
'Cause I'll be rocking this party eight days a week

[Chorus]
No sleep till
No sleep till Brooklyn
No sleep till Brooklyn
No (no) sleep (sleep) till Brooklyn (Brooklyn)
No (no) sleep (sleep) till Brooklyn (yeah)

[Outro]
No (no) sleep (sleep) till Brooklyn (Brooklyn)
No (no) sleep (sleep) till Brooklyn (Brooklyn)
No (no) sleep (sleep) till Brooklyn (Brooklyn)
No (no) sleep (sleep) till Brooklyn (Brooklyn)
No (no) sleep (sleep) till Brooklyn (Brooklyn)
No (no) sleep (sleep) till Brooklyn (Brooklyn)



I've never seen you look like this without a reason
Another promise fallen through
Another season passes by you
I never took the smile away from anybody's face
And that's a desperate way to look for someone who is still a child

[Chorus]
In a big country dreams stay with you
Like a lover's voice fires the mountainside
Stay alive, here we go

I thought that pain and truth were things that really mattered
But you can't stay here with every single hope you had shattered
I'm not expecting to grow flowers in the desert
But I can live and breathe and see the sun in wintertime

[Chorus]
In a big country dreams stay with you
Like a lover's voice fires the mountainside
Stay alive

[Chorus]
In a big country dreams stay with you
Like a lover's voice fires the mountainside
Stay alive

So take that look out of here, it doesn't fit you
Because it's happened doesn't mean you've been discarded
Pull up your head off the floor, come up screaming
Cry out for everything you ever might have wanted
I thought that pain and truth were things that really mattered
But you can't stay here with every single hope you had shattered
I'm not expecting to grow flowers in the desert
But I can live and breathe and see the sun in wintertime

[Chorus]
In a big country dreams stay with you
Like a lover's voice fires the mountainside
Stay alive
Ha, ha

[Chorus]
In a big country dreams stay with you
Like a lover's voice fires the mountainside
Stay alive

[Chorus]
In a big country dreams stay with you
Like a lover's voice fires the mountainside
Stay alive

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
She's always gone too long anytime she goes away

And this house just ain't no home anytime she goes away

Anytime she goes away

Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away

[Verse 1]
On the floor of Tokyo
Or down in London town to go, go
With the record selection
And the mirror's reflection
I'm dancing with myself
When there's no-one else in sight
In the crowded lonely night
Well I wait so long
For my love vibration
And I'm dancing with myself

[Chorus]
Oh oh dancing with myself
Oh oh dancing with myself
Well there's nothing to lose
And there's nothing to prove
I'll be dancing with myself
Oh uh oh oh

[Post-Chorus]
If I looked all over the world
And there's every type of girl
But your empty eyes
Seem to pass me by
Leave me dancing with myself

[Chorus 2]
So let's sink another drink
Cause it'll give me time to think
If I had the chance
I'd ask the world to dance
And I'll be dancing with myself

[Chorus]
Oh oh dancing with myself
Oh oh dancing with myself
Well there's nothing to lose
And there's nothing to prove
I'll be dancing with myself
Oh uh oh oh

And there's every type of girl
But your empty eyes
Seem to pass me by

If I had the chance

Oh dancing with myself
If I had the chance
I'd ask the world to dance
If I had the chance
I'd ask the world to dance
If I had the chance
I'd ask the world to dance



[Verse 1]
I'm all out of hope
One more bad dream could bring a fall
When I'm far from home
Don't call me on the phone
To tell me you're alone
It's easy to deceive
It's easy to tease
But hard to get release

[Hook]
Les yeux sans visage, eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage, eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage, eyes without a face
Got no human grace your eyes without a face

[Verse 2]
I spend so much time
Believing all the lies
To keep the dream alive
Now it makes me sad
It makes me mad at truth
For loving what was you

[Hook]
Les yeux sans visage, eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage, eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage, eyes without a face
Got no human grace your eyes without a face

[Verse 3]
When you hear the music you make a dip
Into someone else's pocket then make a slip
Steal a car and go to Las Vegas oh, the gigolo pool
Hanging out by the state line
Turning holy water into wine
Drinking it down, oh
I'm on a bus on a psychedelic trip
Reading murder books trying to stay hip
I'm thinking of you you're out there so
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Now I close my eyes
And I wonder why
I don't despise
Now all I can do
Is love what was once
So alive and new
But it's gone from your eyes
I'd better realise

[Hook]
Les yeux sans visage, eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage, eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage, eyes without a face
Got no human grace your eyes without a face

[Outro]
Such a human waste your eyes without a face
And now it's getting worse

[Verse 1]
Last night a little dancer came dancing to my door
Last night a little angel came pumping on my floor
She said, "Come on baby, I got a licence for love
And if it expires pray help from above"

[Hook]
In the midnight hour she cried more, more, more
With a rebel yell she cried more, more, more
In the midnight hour babe more, more, more
With a rebel yell more, more, more
More, more, more

But when I'm tired and lonely she sees me to bed
What set you free and brought you to be me babe
What set you free I need you here by me
Because

In the midnight hour she cried more, more, more
With a rebel yell she cried more, more, more
In the midnight hour babe more, more, more

Collects it to go from the 7-11
Well he's out all night to collect a fare
Just so long, just so long it don't mess up his hair

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I walked the world with you, babe
A thousand miles with you
I dried your tears of pain, babe
A million times for you
I'd sell my soul for you babe
For money to burn with you
I'd give you all, and have none, babe
Just, just, justa, justa to have you here by me
Because

Oh yeah little angel
She want more
More, more, more, more, more
Oh yeah little baby
She want more
More, more, more, more



[Verse 1]
Hey little sister, what have you done?
Hey little sister, who's the only one?
Hey little sister, who's your Superman?
Hey little sister, who's the one you want?
Hey little sister, shotgun

[Chorus]
It's a nice day to start again
It's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day to start again

[Verse 2]
Hey little sister, who is it you're with?
Hey little sister, what's your vice or wish?
Hey little sister, shotgun, oh yeah
Hey little sister, who's your Superman?
Hey little sister, shotgun

[Chorus]
It's a nice day to start again
It's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day to start again

[Bridge]
Pick it up
Take me back home, yeah

[Verse 3]
Hey little sister, what have you done?
Hey little sister, who's the only one?
I've been away for so long
I've been away for so long
I let you go for so long

[Chorus]
It's a nice day to start again
It's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day to start again

[Bridge]
There is nothin' fair in this world, girl
There is nothin' safe in this world
And there's nothin' sure in this world
And there's nothin' pure in this world
Look for something left in this world
Start again

[Chorus]
It's a nice day to start again
It's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day to start again



Well we're living here in Allentown
And they're closing all the factories down
Out in Bethlehem they're killing time
Filling out forms
Standing in line

Well our fathers fought the Second World War
Spent their weekends on the Jersey Shore
Met our mothers at the USO
Asked them to dance
Danced with them slow
And we're living here in Allentown

But the restlessness was handed down
And it's getting very hard to stay

Well we're waiting here in Allentown
For the Pennsylvania we never found
For the promises our teachers gave
If we worked hard
If we behaved

So the graduations hang on the wall
But they never really helped us at all
No they never taught us what was real
Iron and coke
And chromium steel
And we're waiting here in Allentown

But they've taken all the coal from the ground
And the union people crawled away

Every child had a pretty good shot
To get at least as far as their old man got
But something happened on the way to that place
They threw an American flag in our face

Well I'm living here in Allentown
And it's hard to keep a good man down
But I won't be getting up today

And it's getting very hard to stay
And we're living here in Allentown



[Verse 1]
Well, you went uptown ridin' in your limousine
With your fine Park Avenue clothes
You had the Dom Perignon in your hand
And the spoon up your nose
Ooh, and when you wake up in the mornin'
With your head on fire
And your eyes too bloody to see
Go on and cry in your coffee
But don't come bitchin' to me

[Chorus]
Because you had to be a big shot, didn't cha
You had to open up your mouth
You had to be a big shot, didn't cha
All your friends were so knocked out
You had to have the last word, last night
You know what everything's about
You had to have a white hot spotlight
You had to be a big shot last night

[Verse 2]
And they were all impressed with your Halston dress
And the people that you knew at Elaine's
And the story of your latest success
You kept 'em so entertained
But now you just don't remember all the things you said
And you're not sure that you want to know
I'll give you one hint, honey
You sure did put on a show

[Chorus]
Yes, yes, you had to be a big shot, didn't cha
You had to prove it to the crowd
You had to be a big shot, didn't cha
All your friends were so knocked out
You had to have the last word, last night
You're so much fun to be around
You had to have the front page, bold type
You had to be a big shot last night

[Verse 3]
Well, it's no big sin to stick your two cents in
If you know when to leave it alone
But you went over the line
You couldn't see it was time to go home
No, no, no, no, no, no

[Chorus]
You had to be a big shot, didn't cha
You had to open up your mouth
You had to be a big shot, didn't cha
All your friends were so knocked out
You had to have the last word, last night
You're so much fun to be around
You had to have a white hot spotlight
You had to be a big shot last night



Saturday night and you're still hanging around
Tired of living in your one horse town
You'd like to find a little hole in the ground
For a while

So you go to the Village in your tie-dye jeans
And you stare at the junkies and the closet queens
It's like some pornographic magazine
And you smile

[Chorus]
Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push, and you'll be smiling

Your sister's gone out, she's on a date
You just sit at home and masturbate
Your phone is gonna ring soon, but you just can't wait
For that call

So you stand on the corner in your New English clothes
And you look so polished from your hair down to your toes
Ah but still your fingers gonna pick your nose
After all

[Chorus]

So you decide to take a holiday
You got your tape deck and your brand new Chevrolet
Ah, there ain't no place to go anyway
What for?

So you got everything, ah, but nothing's cool
They just found your father in the swimming pool
And you guess you won't be going back to school
Anymore

[Chorus]

So you play your albums, and you smoke your pot
And you meet your girlfriend in the parking lot
Oh but still you're aching for the things you haven't got
What went wrong?

And if you can't understand why your world is so dead
Why you've got to keep in style and feed your head
Well you're 21 and still your mother makes your bed
And that's too long

[Chorus]



All the waiters in your grand cafe
Leave their tables when you blink
Every dog must have his everyday
Every drunk must have his drink

[Chorus]
Don't wait for answers
Just take your chances
Don't ask me why

All your life you had to stand in line
Still you're standing on your feet
All your choices made you change your mind
Now your calendar's complete

[Chorus]

You can say the human heart
Is only make-believe
And I am only fighting fire with fire
But you are still a victim
Of the accidents you leave
As sure as I'm a victim of desire

All the servants in your new hotel
Throw their roses at your feet
Fool them all but baby I can tell
You're no stranger to the street

Don't ask for favors
Don't talk to strangers
Don't ask me why

Yesterday you were an only child
Now your ghosts have gone away
You can kill them in the classic style
Now you, "parlez vous francais"

[Chorus]



We met as soul mates on Parris Island
We left as inmates from an asylum
And we were sharp, as sharp as knives
And we were so gung ho to lay down our lives

We came in spastic like tameless horses
We left in plastic as numbered corpses
And we learned fast to travel light
Our arms were heavy but our bellies were tight

We had no home front, we had no soft soap
They sent us Playboy, they gave us Bob Hope
We dug in deep and shot on sight
And prayed to Jesus Christ with all our might

We had no cameras to shoot the landscape
We passed the hash pipe and played our Doors tapes
And it was dark, so dark at night
And we held on to each other
Like brother to brother
We promised our mothers we'd write

[Chorus]
And we would all go down together
We said we'd all go down together
Yes we would all go down together

Remember Charlie, remember Baker
They left their childhood on every acre
And who was wrong? And who was right?
It didn't matter in the thick of the fight

We held the day in the palm of our hand
They ruled the night, and the night
Seemed to last as long as six weeks
On Parris Island
We held the coastline, they held the highlands

And they were sharp, as sharp as knives
They heard the hum of our motors
They counted the rotors
And waited for us to arrive

[Chorus]
And we would all go down together
We said we'd all go down together
Yes we would all go down together



What's the matter with the clothes I'm wearing?
"Can't you tell that your tie's too wide?"
Maybe I should buy some old tab collars?
"Welcome back to the age of jive
Where have you been hidin' out lately, honey?
You can't dress trashy till you spend a lot of money."

[Chorus 1]
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me

What's the matter with the car I'm driving?
"Can't you tell that it's out of style?"
Should I get a set of white wall tires?
"Are you gonna cruise the miracle mile?
Nowadays you can't be too sentimental
Your best bet's a true baby blue Continental."

Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk
It's still rock and roll to me

Oh, it doesn't matter what they say in the papers
Cause it's always been the same old scene
There's a new band in town
But you can't get the sound from a story in a magazine...
Aimed at your average teen

How about a pair of pink sidewinders
And a bright orange pair of pants?
"You could really be a Beau Brummel baby
If you just give it half a chance
Don't waste your money on a new set of speakers
You get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers."

[Chorus 3]
Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me

What's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing?
"Don't you know that they're out of touch?"
Should I try to be a straight 'A' student?
"If you are then you think too much
Don't you know about the new fashion honey?
All you need are looks and a whole lotta money."

[Chorus 3]
Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me

What's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing?
"Don't you know that they're out of touch?"
Should I try to be a straight 'A' student?
"If you are then you think too much
Don't you know about the new fashion honey?
All you need are looks and a whole lotta money."

[Chorus 1]
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me



[Verse 1]
Anthony works in the grocery store
Savin' his pennies for someday
Mama Leone left a note on the door
She said "Sonny, move out to the country"
Workin' too hard can give you
A heart attack
You oughta know by now
Who needs a house out in Hackensack
Is that all you get for your money

[Chorus]
And it seems such a waste of time
If that's what it's all about
Mama, if that's movin' up then I'm movin' out

[Verse 2]
Sergeant O'Leary is walkin' the beat
At night he becomes a bartender
He works at Mr. Cacciatore's down on Sullivan Street
Across from the medical center
Yeah and he's tradin' in his Chevy for a Cadillac
You oughta know by now
And if he can't drive with a broken back
At least he can polish the fenders

[Chorus]
And it seems such a waste of time
If that's what it's all about
Mama, if that's movin' up then I'm movin' out

[Verse 3]
You should never argue with a crazy mind
You oughta know by now
You can pay Uncle Sam with the overtime
Is that all you get for your money

[Chorus 2]
And if that's what you have in mind
Yeah, if that's what you're all about
Good luck movin' up cause I'm movin' out



[Verse 1]
Got a call from an old friend we'd used to be real close
Said he couldn't go on the American way
Closed the shop, sold the house, bought a ticket to the west coast
Now he gives them a stand-up routine in L.A

[Chorus 1]
I don't need you to worry for me 'cause I'm alright
I don't want you to tell me it's time to come home

[Chorus 2]
I don't care what you say anymore, this is my life
Go ahead with your own life, leave me alone

[Bridge]
I never said you had to offer me a second chance
I never said I was a victim of circumstance
I still belong
Don't get me wrong
And you can speak your mind
But not on my time

[Verse 2]
They will tell you you can't sleep alone in a strange place
Then they'll tell you can't sleep with somebody else
Ah but sooner or later you sleep in your own space
Either way it's okay, you wake up with yourself

[Chorus 1]
I don't need you to worry for me 'cause I'm alright
I don't want you to tell me it's time to come home

[Chorus 2]
I don't care what you say anymore, this is my life
Go ahead with your own life, leave me alone

[Bridge]
I never said you had to offer me a second chance
I never said I was a victim of circumstance
I still belong
Don't get me wrong
And you can speak your mind
But not on my time

[Interlude]

[Chorus 2]
I don't care what you say anymore, this is my life
Go ahead with your own life, leave me alone

[Outro]
Keep it to yourself, it's my life
Keep it to yourself, it's my life
Keep it to yourself, it's my life
Keep it to yourself, it's my life



Some folks like to get away, take a holiday from the neighborhood
Hop a flight to Miami Beach or to Hollywood
But I'm taking a Greyhound on the Hudson River line
I'm in a New York state of mind

I've seen all the movie stars in their fancy cars and their limousines
Been high in the Rockies under the evergreens
I know what I'm needing, and I don't want to waste more time
I'm in a New York state of mind

[Bridge]
It was so easy living day by day;
Out of touch with the rhythm and blues
But now I need a little give and take
The New York Times, The Daily News

[Verse 3]
It comes down to reality, and it's fine with me cause I've let it slide
I don't care if it's Chinatown or on Riverside
I don't have any reasons I left them all behind
I'm in a New York state of mind

[Bridge]
It was so easy living day by day;
Out of touch with the rhythm and blues
But now I need a little give and take
The New York Times, The Daily News

[Verse 3]
I'm just taking a Greyhound on the Hudson River line
Because I'm in a New York state of mind



[Verse 1]
Come out Virginia, don't let me wait
You Catholic girls start much too late
Aw, but sooner or later it comes down to fate
I might as well be the one

Well, they showed you a statue, told you to pray
They built you a temple and locked you away
But they never told you the price that you pay
For things that you might have done
Only the good die young

[Chorus]
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

You might have heard I run with a dangerous crowd
We ain't too pretty, we ain't too proud
We might be laughing a bit too loud
But that never hurt no one

So come on Virginia, show me a sign
Send up a signal, I'll throw you the line
The stained-glass curtain you're hiding behind
Never lets in the sun
Darling only the good die young

[Chorus]
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

You got a nice white dress and a party on your confirmation
You got a brand new soul
And a cross of gold
But Virginia, they didn't give you quite enough information
You didn't count on me
When you were counting on your rosary

They say there's a heaven for those who will wait
Some say it's better, but I say it ain't
I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints
The sinners are much more fun
You know that only the good die young

[Chorus]
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

Said, your mother told you "All that I could give you was a reputation."
Aw, she never cared for me
But did she ever say a prayer for me?

[Verse 1]
Come out Virginia, don't let me wait
You Catholic girls start much too late
Aw, but sooner or later it comes down to fate
I might as well be the one

Well, they showed you a statue, told you to pray
They built you a temple and locked you away
But they never told you the price that you pay
For things that you might have done
Only the good die young

[Chorus]
Only the good die young
Only the good die young



[Verse 1]
It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
The regular crowd shuffles in
There's an old man sitting next to me
Making love to his tonic and gin

He says, "Son, can you play me a memory
I'm not really sure how it goes
But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete
When I wore a younger man's clothes."

[Pre-Chorus]
La la la, di da da
La la, di da da da dum

[Chorus]
Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feeling alright

[Verse 2]
Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be
He says, "Bill, I believe this is killing me."
As the smile ran away from his face
"Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place"

[Pre-Chorus]
La la la, di da da
La la, di da da da dum

[Verse 3]
Now Paul is a real estate novelist
Who never had time for a wife
And he's talkin' with Davy, who's still in the Navy
And probably will be for life

And the waitress is practicing politics
As the businessmen slowly get stoned
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
But it's better than drinkin' alone

[Chorus]
Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feeling alright

[Verse 4]
It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
And the manager gives me a smile
‘Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
To forget about life for a while
And the piano, it sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
And say, "Man, what are you doin' here?"

[Pre-Chorus]
La la la, di da da
La la, di da da da dum

[Chorus]
Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feeling alright



[Prelude]
[Instrumental]

[Angry Young Man]
There's a place in the world for the angry young man
With his working class ties and his radical plans
He refuses to bend, he refuses to crawl
He's always at home with his back to the wall
And he's proud of his scars and the battles he's lost
And he struggles and bleeds as he hangs on the cross
And he likes to be known as the angry young man

Give a moment or two to the angry young man
With his foot in his mouth and his heart in his hand
He's been stabbed in the back, he's been misunderstood
It's a comfort to know his intentions are good
And he sits in a room with a lock on the door
With his maps and his medals laid out on the floor
And he likes to be known as the angry young man

I believe I've passed the age of consciousness and righteous rage
I found that just surviving was a noble fight
I once believed in causes too
I had my pointless point of view
And life went on no matter who was wrong or right

And there's always a place for the angry young man
With his fist in the air and his head in the sand
And he's never been able to learn from mistakes
So he can't understand why his heart always breaks
But his honor is pure and his courage as well
And he's fair and he's true and he's boring as hell
And he'll go to the grave as an angry old man

There's a place in the world for the angry young man
With his working class ties and his radical plans
He refuses to bend, he refuses to crawl
He's always at home with his back to the wall
And he's proud of his scars and the battles he's lost
And he struggles and bleeds as he hangs on the cross
And he likes to be known as the angry young man



A bottle of white, a bottle of red
Perhaps a bottle of rosé instead
We'll get a table near the street
In our old familiar place
You and I, face to face

A bottle of red, a bottle of white
It all depends upon your appetite
I'll meet you any time you want
In our Italian restaurant

Things are okay with me these days
Got a good job, got a good office
Got a new wife, got a new life
And the family's fine
We lost touch long ago
You lost weight
I did not know
You could ever look so nice
After so much time

You remember those days hanging out
At the village green
Engineer boots, leather jackets
And tight blue jeans
Oh, you drop a dime in the box
Play the song about New Orleans
Cold beer, hot lights
My sweet romantic teenage nights

Brenda and Eddie were the popular steadies
And the king and the queen of the prom
Riding around with the car top down
And the radio on
Nobody looked any finer
Or was more of a hit at the Parkway Diner
We never knew we could want more than that out of life
Surely Brenda and Eddie would always know how to survive

Brenda and Eddie were still going steady
In the summer of '75
When they decided their marriage should be
At the end of July
Everyone said they were crazy
"Brenda you know that you're much too lazy
And Eddie could never afford to live that kind of life."
Oh but there we were waving Brenda and Eddie goodbye

Well, they got an apartment with deep pile carpet
And a couple of paintings from Sears
A big waterbed that they bought with the bread
They had saved for a couple of years
They started to fight when the money got tight
And they just didn't count on the tears

Yeah, rock and roll!

Well, they lived for a while in a very nice style
But it's always the same in the end
They got a divorce as a matter of course
And they parted the closest of friends
Then the king and the queen went back to the green
But you can never go back there again

Brenda and Eddie had had it already
By the summer of '75
From the high to the low
To the end of the show
For the rest of their lives
They couldn't go back to the Greasers
The best they could do was pick up their pieces
We always knew they would both find a way to get by

That's all I heard about Brenda and Eddie
Can't tell you more than I told you already
And here we are waving Brenda and Eddie goodbye

Bottle of red, bottle of white
Whatever kind of mood you're in tonight
I'll meet you anytime you want
In our Italian restaurant



She can kill with a smile, she can wound with her eyes
She can ruin your faith with her casual lies
And she only reveals what she wants you to see
She hides like a child but she's always a woman to me

She can lead you to love, she can take you or leave you
She can ask for the truth but she'll never believe you
And she'll take what you give her as long as it's free
Yeah she steals like a thief but she's always a woman to me

[Bridge]
Oh, she takes care of herself, she can wait if she wants
She's ahead of her time
Oh, and she never gives out and she never gives in
She just changes her mind

And she'll promise you more than the Garden of Eden
Then she'll carelessly cut you and laugh while you're bleeding
But she brings out the best and the worst you can be
Blame it all on yourself cause she's always a woman to me

[Bridge]

She is frequently kind and she's suddenly cruel
She can do as she pleases, she's nobody's fool
But she can't be convicted, she's earned her degree
And the most she will do is throw shadows at you
But she's always a woman to me



I didn't want to do it but I got too lonely
I had to call you up in the middle of the night
I know it's awful hard to try to make love long distance
But I really needed stimulation
Though it was only my imagination

It's just a fantasy (oh)
It's not the real thing (oh)
It's just a fantasy (oh)
It's not the real thing (oh)
Sometimes a fantasy (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Is all you need, oh

When am I gonna take control get a hold of my emotions?
Why does it only seem to hit me in the middle of the night?
You told me there's a number I can always dial for assistance
I don't want to deal with outside action
Only you can give me satisfaction

It's just a fantasy (oh)
It's not the real thing (oh)
It's just a fantasy (oh)
It's not the real thing (oh)
Sometimes a fantasy (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Is all you need, oh

Sure it would be better if I had you here to hold me
Be better baby but believe me it's the next best thing
I'm sure there's many times you've wanted me to hear your secrets
Don't be afraid to say the words that move me
Anytime you want to tell them to me

It's just a fantasy (oh)
It's not the real thing (oh)
It's just a fantasy (oh)
It's not the real thing (oh)
Sometimes a fantasy (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Is all you need

It's just a fantasy (it's just a fantasy)
It's not the real thing (it's not the real thing)
It's just a fantasy (it's just a fantasy)
It's not the real thing (it's not the real thing)

It's just a fantasy (it's just a fantasy)
It's not the real thing (it's not the real thing)
It's just a fantasy (it's just a fantasy)
It's not the real thing (it's not the real thing)



From a town known as Wheeling, West Virginia
Rode a boy with a six-gun in his hand
And his daring life of crime
Made him a legend in his time
East and west of the Rio Grande

Well, he started with a bank in Colorado;
In the pocket of his vest, a Colt he hid
And his age and his size
Took the teller by surprise
And the word spread of Billy the Kid

Well, he never traveled heavy; yes he always rode alone
And he soon put many other guns to shame
And he never had a sweetheart, and he never had a home
But the cowboy and the rancher knew his name

Well, he robbed his way from Utah to Oklahoma
And the law just could not seem to track him down
And it served his legend well
For the folks they loved to tell
About when Billy the Kid came to town

[Musical interlude]

Well, one cold day a posse captured Billy
And the judge said, "String him up for what he did."
And the cowboys and their kin
Like the sea came pouring in
To watch the hanging of Billy the Kid

And he never traveled heavy; yes he always rode alone
And he soon put many other guns to shame
And he never had a sweetheart, but he finally found a home
Underneath the boot hill grave that bears his name

From a town known as Oyster Bay, Long Island
Rode a boy with a six-pack in his hand
And his daring life of crime
Made him a legend in his time
East and west of the Rio Grande



Well, we all have a face that we hide away forever
And we take them out and show ourselves when everyone has gone
Some are satin, some are steel
Some are silk and some are leather
They're the faces of a stranger
But we'd love to try them on

[Chorus]
Well, we all fall in love
But we disregard the danger
Though we share so many secrets
There are some we never tell
Why were you so surprised that you never saw the stranger?
Did you ever let your lover see the stranger in yourself?

[Bridge]
Don't be afraid to try again
Everyone goes south every now and then
You've done it
Why can't someone else?
You should know by now
You've been there yourself

Once I used to believe I was such a great romancer
Then I came home to a woman that I could not recognize
When I pressed her for a reason
She refused to even answer
It was then I felt the stranger kick me right between the eyes

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

You may never understand how the stranger is inspired
But he isn't always evil and he is not always wrong
Though you drown in good intentions
You will never quench the fire
You'll give in to your desire when the stranger comes along



Friday night, I crashed your party
Saturday, I said I'm sorry
Sunday, came and trashed me out again
I was only having fun
Wasn't hurting any one
And we all enjoyed the weekend for a change
I've been stranded in the combat zone
I walked through Bedford Stuy alone
Even rode my motorcycle in the rain
And you told me not to drive
But I made it home alive
So you said that only proves that I'm insane

[Chorus]
You may be right
I may be crazy
But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for
Turn out the light
Don't try to save me
You may be wrong for all I know
But you may be right

Remember how I found you there
Alone in your electric chair
I told you dirty jokes until you smiled
You were lonely for a man
I said take me as I am
Beause you might enjoy some madness for a while
Now think of all the years you tried to
Find someone to satisfy you
I might be as crazy as you say
If I'm crazy then it's true
That it's all because of you
And you wouldn't want me any other way

[Chorus][Repeat 2x]



I'm starin? at the four walls
Sittin? here, waitin? by the telephone
Your words are runnin? through my mind child
Cut me like a knife, you don't wanna see me any more
Well I know you're nothin? special
So how come you can be so impressional
I tried to figure it out, got a black out
I guess I call you inessential
Baby come back, baby come back cause I'm all alone
Baby come back, baby come back I'm in the danger zone
My heart ain't made of plastic
I'm tellin? ya, I'm gonna do somethin? drastic, (drastic)
I'm trying to bide my time
Takin? my time_________________________
Well I know I'm not original
But listen here, I should be more than your provisional
You keep runnin? around, all around town
Actin? like a cool individual
Baby come back, baby come back cause I'm all alone
Baby come back, baby come back I'm in the danger zone

I said, baby come back, baby come back cause I'm all alone
Baby come back, baby come back I'm in the danger zone
Baby come back, back, back, back
Baby come back, back, back, back
Baby come back, back, back, back
Baby come back, back, back, back
Baby come back, back, back, back
Baby come back, back, back, back
Baby come back, back, back, back
Baby come back I'm in the danger zone
I said, baby come back, baby come back cause I'm all alone
Baby come back, (ooh baby come back)baby come back I'm in the danger zone
I said, baby come back, baby come back
Baby come back cause I'm all alone
Baby come back, (ooh baby come back)baby come back I'm in the danger zone
I said baby come back, baby come back, baby come back cause I'm all alone
Baby come back, oh baby, baby come back I'm in the danger zone

You see 'em coming at you every night
Strung on pretension, they fall for you at first sight
You know their business, you think it's a bore
They make you restless, it's nothing you ain't seen before

Get around town, spend your time on the run
You never let down, say you do it for fun
Never miss a play, though you make quite a few
You give it all away, everybody wants you
Yeah

You crave attention, you can never say no
Throw your affections any way the wind blows
You always make it, you're on top of the scene
You sell the copy like the cover of a magazine, ooh

Putting on the eyes till there's nobody else
You never realize what you do to yourself
The things that they see make the daily reviews
You never get free, everybody wants you

Everybody knows you
Everybody snows you
Everybody leads you, needs you, bleeds you

Nights of confusion and impossible dreams
Days at the mirror, patching up around the seams
You got your glory, you paid for it all
You take your pension in loneliness and alcohol

Say goodbye to conventional ways
You can't escape the hours, you lose track of the days
The more you understand, seems the more like you do
You never get away, everybody wants you, ooh

Everybody wants you
Everybody wants you



Life isn't easy from the singular side
Down in the hole, some emotions are hard to hide
It's your decision, it's a chance that you take
It's on your head, it's a habit that's hard to break

Do you need a friend?
Would you tell no lies?
Would you take me in?
Are you lonely in the dark?
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark

You never listen to the voices inside
They fill your ears as you run to a place to hide
You're never sure if the illusion is real
You pinch yourself but the memories are all you feel

Can you break away
From your alibis?
Can you make a play?
Oh, will you meet me in the dark?
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark

Don'tcha need me, hey, hey
Don'tcha need me, oh yeah
Don'tcha leave me, hey, hey
Don'tcha need me, oh yeah

You take no interest, no opinion's too dear
You make the rounds, oh, you try to be so sincere
You guard your hopes and you pocket your dreams
You'd trade it all to avoid an unpleasant scene

Can you face the fire
When you see me there?
Can you feel the fire?
Will you love me in the dark?
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark



Lonely is the night when you find yourself alone
Your demons come to light and your mind is not your own
Lonely is the night when there's no one left to call
You feel the time is right, say, the writing's on the wall, yeah

And it's a high time to fight when the walls are closing in
A-call it what you like, it's time you got to win
Lonely, lonely, lonely, your spirit's sinking down
You find you're not the only stranger in this town

Red lights, green lights, stop and go jive
Headlines, deadlines jamming your mind
You been stealing shots from the side
Let your feelings go for a ride

There's danger out tonight, the man is on the prowl
Get the dynamite, the boys are set to prowl
Lonely is the night when you hear the voices call
Are you ready for a fight? Do you wanna take it all?

Slowdown, showdown, waiting on line
Showtime, no time, changing your mind
Streets are ringing, march to the sound
Let your secrets follow you down

Somebody's watching you, baby, so much you can do
Nobody's stopping you, baby, from making it too
One glimpse'll show you now, baby, what the music can do
One kiss'll show you now, baby, it can happen to you

No more sleeping, wasting our time
Midnight creeping's first on our mind
No more lazing around the TV
You'll go crazy, come out with me

Say you're lonely?
Come out
Lonely is the night
A-you don't have to be lonely
Come out
Lonely is the night



You got me runnin' baby
You give me somethin' way beyond revenue
You put the magic in me
I feel the magic when we do what we do
And oh
I can't do without you for too long
You're my situation
You're my kinda lover

You keep me all together
You take me out whenever I'm lettin' down
You got the motions baby
I got a notion maybe I'll stick around
And oh
I can never doubt you for too long
I can't see no reason
You're my kinda lover

When you come 'round I never get down
I fly across the floor
I can see you comin' on me
And I can't ask for more
Rock me, sock me
Baby you got me ridin' to the end
Rake me, shake me
Baby you make me turn me on again

You got my motor racin'
I find my thoughts embracin' your every move
I wanna set you reelin'
I wanna make you feel the way that I do
And oh
I been thinkin' 'bout you for so long
I don't wanna lose ya
You're my kinda lover



I'm rockin' tonite - I'm walkin' on air
Gonna find me some trouble - gonna grab my share
I want ya tonite - I want ya with me
Make me guilty of love in the first degree
You want it all right... we're goin' in style
Say you walk right - you talk right - and your hair's so wild
Snow-white - hey that's not what I mean
We go down in the shadows and crawl between
Moonlight in the city brings the magic to your eyes
Freezin' a moment - leave me paralyzed
Breathe an emotion - set it dancin' in my ear
Bring on the rhythm when I hold you near
Take me in your arms - roll me through the night
Take me to your heart - rock me tonite
You do it all right - you're passion to see
You been schooled in the art of romancin' me
Hold tight - you're in for a ride
Can you feel the blood poundin' way down inside
No one's stoppin' us now -
We go down, down where the music's loud
If it's all night - hey that's all right by me
Go and play on my love - play it all for me
Life's never easy - we can make it if we try
Takin' our chances - face 'em side by side
Live for the moment - on that we can agree
Come and take me where I long to be
Chorus
A time for all... and all in time
To slip beyond the border line
Of who we are and where we long to be...
When every night you hear the sound
Of wakin' up and breakin' down
You find a chance and heave it all away
Chorus



Take my soul to the lost-and-found
Girl she made me a hand-me-down
Never know when she'll come around or what I'll see
No resistance--it's hardly fair
Call my name, honey--I'll be there
I'll give in to you anywhere..so foolishly
I could never ever lie to you
I could never even try
I just wanna be beside you

Sweet emotion'll pass you by
Girl she left me alone to cry
I still remember how she could make love to me
You see the traces--they always show
Some may come and some may go
But one of us will never know what you see
Never wanted to rely on you
Never wanted you to try
I just wanna be beside you

She's a runner...anyone can see
She's a runner...she run all over me
She's a runner...you can't walk away
She's a runner..she can make you stay

I need to listen to my advice
The aggravation ain't worth the price
I can tell ya she won't think twice
She gonna knock down, put ya down..oo yea

She's a runner...anyone can see
She's a runner...she tore it out a me
She's a runner...watch her walk away
She's a runner...you can't make her stay



Now everybody - have you heard
If you're in the game, then the stroke's the word
Don't take no rhythm - don't take no style
Got a thirst for killing - grab your vile

You put your right hand out - give a firm hand-shake
Talk to me about the one big break
Spread the ear pollution both far and wide
Keep your contributions by your side and stroke me, stroke me

Could be a winner boy, you move quite well
You got your number down
Say you're a winner but man you're just a sinner now

You put your left foot out - keep it all in place
Work your way right into my case
First you try to bed me - you make my backbone slide
But when you find you bled me - skip on by
Keep on - stroke me, stroke me -

Give me the business all night long
You're so together boy
Say you're a winner but man you're just a sinner now

Better listen now...said it ain't no joke
Let your conscience fail ya...just do the stroke
Don'tcha take no chances...keep your eye on top
Do your fancy dances...you can't stop, you just



People of the Earth can you hear me?
Came a voice from the sky on that magical night
And in the colors of a thousand sunsets
They traveled through the world on a silvery light

The people of the Earth stood waiting
Watching as the ships came one by one
Setting fire to the sky as they landed
Carrying to the world Children Of The Sun
Children of the sun

All at once came a sound from the inside
Then a beam made of light hit the ground
Everyone felt the sound of their heartbeat
Every Man - Every Woman - Every Child

They passed the limits of imagination
Through the doors - to a world - of another time
On the journey of a thousand lifetimes
With the Children Of The Sun - They started to climb

Children of the sun, children of the sun

No more gravity, nothing holding them down
Floating endlessly, as their ship leaves the ground
Thru the walls of time - at the speed of light
Fly the crystal ships on their celestial flight
On their celestial flight

Children of the sun, children of the sun
Children of the sun

Children of the sun, children of the sun
Children of the sun, children of the sun
Children of the sun, children of the sun
Children of the sun, children of the sun

Children of the sun, children of the sun
Children of the sun, children of the sun



[Instrumental Intro: "Jack The Stripper"]

[Verse 1: Ozzy Osbourne]
Goin' home, late last night
Suddenly I got a fright
Yeah I looked through the window and surprised what I saw
Fairies with boots and dancing with a dwarf
All right now!

[Chorus: Ozzy Osbourne]
Fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
Yeah I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lies
Yeah, Fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes
All right now!

[Guitar Solo: Tony Iommi]

[Chorus: Ozzy Osbourne]
Fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
Yeah I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lies
Yeah, Fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes
All right now!

[Verse 2: Ozzy Osbourne]
So I went to the doctor, see what he could give me
He said "Son, son, you've gone too far
Cause smokin' and trippin' is all that you do

[Outro: Ozzy Osbourne]
Yeah!



Sing me a song, you're a singer
Do me a wrong, you're a bringer of evil
The Devil is never a maker
The less that you give, you're a taker
So it's on and on and on, it's Heaven and Hell, oh well

The lover of life's not a sinner
The ending is just a beginner
The closer you get to the meaning
The sooner you'll know that you're dreaming
So it's on and on and on, oh it's on and on and on
It goes on and on and on, Heaven and Hell
I can tell, fool, fool!

Well if it seems to be real, it's illusion
For every moment of truth, there's confusion in life
Love can be seen as the answer, but nobody bleeds for the dancer
And it's on and on, on and on and on....

They say that life's a carousel
Spinning fast, you've got to ride it well
The world is full of Kings and Queens
Who blind your eyes and steal your dreams
It's Heaven and Hell, oh well
And they'll tell you black is really white
The moon is just the sun at night
And when you walk in golden halls
You get to keep the gold that falls
It's Heaven and Hell, oh no!
Fool, fool!
You've got to bleed for the dancer!
Fool, fool!
Look for the answer!
Fool, fool, fool!



I am Iron Man!

[Verse 1]
Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all
Or if he moves will he fall?

Is he live or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there
Why should we even care?

He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
When he traveled time
For the future of mankind

[Chorus]
Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfurl

[Verse 2]
Now the time is here
For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved

[Chorus]
Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now he has his revenge

[Verse 3]
Heavy boots of lead
Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can
Iron Man lives again!



[Bass Instrumental: Bassically]

[Verse 1]
Some people say my love cannot be true
Please believe me, my love, and I'll show you
I will give you those things you thought unreal
The sun, the moon, the stars all bear my seal

[Verse 2]
Follow me now and you will not regret
Leaving the life you led before we met
You are the first to have this love of mine
Forever with me 'til the end of time

[Chorus]
Your love for me has just got to be real
Before you know the way I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel

[Verse 3]
Now I have you with me, under my power
Our love grows stronger now with every hour
Look into my eyes, you'll see who I am
My name is Lucifer, please take my hand

[Verse 2]
Follow me now and you will not regret
Leaving the life you led before we met
You are the first to have this love of mine
Forever with me 'til the end of time

[Chorus]
Your love for me has just got to be real
Before you know the way I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel

[Verse 3]
Now I have you with me, under my power
Our love grows stronger now with every hour
Look into my eyes, you'll see who I am
My name is Lucifer, please take my hand



Oh no, here it comes again
Can't remember when we came so close to love before
Hold on, good things never last
Nothing's in the past, it always seems to come again
Again and again and again

Cry out to legions of the brave
Time again to save us from the jackals of the street
Ride out, protectors of the realm
Captain's at the helm, sail across the sea of lights

Circles and rings, dragons and kings
Weaving a charm and a spell
Blessed by the night, holy and bright
Called by the toll of the bell

Bloodied angels fast descending
Moving on a never-bending light
Phantom figures free forever
Out of shadows, shining ever-bright

Neon Knights!
Neon Knights! all right!

Cry out to legions of the brave
Time again to save us from the jackals of the street
Ride out, protectors of the realm
Captain's at the helm, sail across the sea of lights
Again and again, again and again and again

Neon Knights!
Neon Knights!
Neon Knights!
All right!



[Verse 1]
Finished with my woman
'Cause she couldn't help me with my mind
People think I'm insane
Because I am frowning all the time

All day long, I think of things
But nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind
If I don't find something to pacify

[Chorus]
Can you help me occupy my brain?
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
I need someone to show me
The things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness
I must be blind

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
Make a joke and I will sigh
And you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness, I cannot feel
And love, to me, is so unreal

And so, as you hear these words
Telling you, now, of my state
I tell you to enjoy life
I wish I could, but it's too late



[Intro]
"Coughing"
Alright now!
Won't you listen?

[Verse 1]
When I first met you, didn't realize
I can't forget you or your surprise
You introduced me to my mind
And left me wanting you and your kind

I love you, oh you know it

[Verse 2]
My life was empty, forever on a down
Until you took me, showed me around
My life is free now, my life is clear
I love you sweet leaf, though you can't hear

Come on now, try it out

[Verse 3]
Straight people don't know what you're about
They put you down and shut you out
You gave to me a new belief
And soon the world will love you, sweet leaf



He was the wizard of a thousand kings
And I chanced to meet him one night wandering
He told me tales and he drank my wine
Me and my magic man, kinda feelin' fine

He had a cloak of gold and eyes of fire
And as he spoke, I felt a deep desire
To free the world of its fear and pain
And help the people to feel free again

Why don't we listen to the voices in our heart?
Cause then I know we'd find we're not so far apart
Everybody's got to be happy
Everyone should sing
For we know the joy of life
Peace and love can bring

So spoke the wizard in his mountain home
The vision of his wisdom means we'll never be alone
And I will dream of my magic night
And the million silver stars that guide me with their light
Aaahh ..aahhh
Aaahh ..aahhh
Aaahh ..aahhh



[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Generals gathered in their masses
Just like witches at black masses
Evil minds that plot destruction
Sorcerers of death's construction
In the fields the bodies burning
As the war machine keeps turning
Death and hatred to mankind
Poisoning their brainwashed minds
Oh Lord, yeah!

[Verse 2]
Politicians hide themselves away
They only started the war
Why should they go out to fight?
They leave that all to the poor! Yeah!
Time will tell on their power minds
Making war just for fun
Treating people just like pawns in chess
Wait 'till their judgement day comes, yeah!

[Verse 3]
Now in darkness, world stops turning
Ashes where their bodies burning
No more war pigs have the power
Hand of god has struck the hour
Day of judgement, god is calling
On their knees, the war pigs crawling
Begging mercy for their sins
Satan, laughing, spreads his wings
Oh Lord, yeah!



[Verse 1 - Blackfoot]
Well, another day, another dollar
After I've sang and hollered
Oh, it's my way of living, and I can't change a thing
Another town is drawing near
Oh, baby, I wish you were here
But the only way I can see you, darlin', is in my dreams

[Chorus 1 -Blackfoot]
It's a highway song
You sing it on and on
On and on

[Verse 2 - Blackfoot]
Well, the hurt you leave behind
It's the hurt that's on your mind
Oh, and last night's show took its toll on me
Well the city lights fly by me
As I lay my body in my bed
Oh, and dreams of you dance through my head

[Chorus 2 - Blackfoot]
It's a highway song
You sing it on and on
On and on
Highway song
Is as lonely
As the road I'm on

Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 3 - Blackfoot]
It's those big wheels are ready to roll
We've be flyin' high and so low
Lord, and all this madness, ain't crazy as it seems
Everywhere they stop and stare
I'm just a stranger on this road
Oh, I stand alone
Only in my dream

[Chorus 3 - Outro - Blackfoot]
Highway song
You sing it on and on
On and on
Highway song
Is as lonely
As the road I'm on (Well, highway song)
Highway song
You sing it on and on
On and on
Highway song
Is as lonely
As the road I'm on



[Couplet 1]
Transports, train-train, va-et-vient
Pourtant, te lever et taffer, il fallait bien
A l'époque, tu t'rappelles : tu n'valais rien
Mais t'as compris qu'cette vie de galérien n'avait rien d'aérien
Comme les wagons, les jours se suivent et se ressemblent
T'aimerais tellement changer de vie, ouais, te recentrer
Mais n'importe où dans l'Monde tu te ferais chier, il me semble
Parce qu'un jour ou l'autre revient l'envie de rentrer
Nos rêves d'adolescents passent à la passoire
Fins de mois trop stressants, pas d’échappatoire
On se renifle, on cherche une place pour s'asseoir
Un peu comme des bestiaux qui partent à l’abattoir

[Refrain]
T'es plus acteur, mais spectateur : train-train
Ta vie : tu la connais par coeur : train-train
Tes collègues sont tes détracteurs : train-train
Leur haleine de torréfacteur : train-train

[Pont]
Mélancolie des transports en commun
Étrange folie, échanges morts entre humains
On n'se parle pas, mais on s'reverra demain
La vie active : quelle vipère, quel venin

[Couplet 2]
Au-au volant c'est cent pour cent, oeil pour oeil, dent pour dent
C'est flippant tout le temps, on est vivant pourtant
Nos vies se jouent à des queues de poisson
A des comportements fous, sans boisson, ni autres poisons
A tombeaux ouverts dans des cercueils métalliques
Cerveaux reptiliens cherchent connards mécaniques
Maman Monospace devrait freiner mes paniques
La mort se rit de son récent vaccin anti-tétanique
Et quand le drame survient, y a-t-il quelqu'un ?
Rien, embouteillages et dépassements mesquins
Chacun sa vie, ouais, chacun son destin
Bref, chacun sa file, chacun traque son festin

[Refrain] (x2)
T'es plus acteur, mais spectateur : train-train
Ta vie : tu la connais par coeur : train-train
Tes collègues sont tes détracteurs : train-train
Leur haleine de torréfacteur : train-train

[Verse 1: Steve Winwood]
Come down off your throne and leave your body alone
Somebody must change
You are the reason I've been waiting so long
Somebody holds the key

[Chorus: Steve Winwood]
But I'm near the end and I just ain't got the time
And I'm wasted and I can't find my way home

[Verse 2: Steve Winwood]
Come down on your own and leave your body alone
Somebody must change
You are the reason I've been waiting all these years
Somebody holds the key

[Chorus: Steve Winwood]
But I'm near the end and I just ain't got the time
And I'm wasted and I can't find my way home

[Outro: Steve Winwood]
But I can't find my way home
But I can't find my way home
But I can't find my way home
But I can't find my way home
Still I can't find my way home
And I've done nothing wrong
But I can't find my way home



Tongue tied, nerves as big as boulders
Why Mom, I thought I was your soldier
My brother sits by me
Buckled into the carseat

Feel the thirst, it's time for pulling over
Into the truckstop on my daddy's shoulder
Out back where they plant all the trees
Ten feet away my daddy buries me

[God's Presents]

If my path be smooth or rugged
If with thorns or roses strewn
Where I go the Father seeith
And He will leave me not alone

If I take the wings of morning
Far within the giant sea
Even there His hand will leave me
Even there my God will be

Though the gloom of night be round me
Though I cannot see my way
Yet the Lord will see and guide me
Because unto Him the night is day

If my thought are good or evil
Set me think to hide them not
There is one above all seeing
And He beholdth every thought

And ever more my eyes beholds me
And all my ways to Him are known
And His loving arms enfolds me
He will leave me not alone



[Verse 1]
All I can say is that my life is pretty plain
I like watching the puddles gather rain
And all I can do is just pour some tea for two
And speak my point of view, but it's not sane
It's not sane

[Chorus]
I just want someone to say to me:
"I'll always be there when you wake"
You know, I'd like to keep my cheeks dry, today
So, stay with me and I'll have it made

[Verse 2]
And I don't understand why I sleep all day
And I start to complain that there's no rain
And all I can do is read a book to stay awake
And it rips my life away, but it's a great escape
Escape
Escape
Escape

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
All I can say is that my life is pretty plain
You don't like my point of view
You think that I'm insane
Its not sane
It's not sane

[Chorus]
I just want someone to say to me:
"I'll always be there when you wake"
You know, I'd like to keep my cheeks dry, today
So, stay with me and I'll have it made
I'll have it made
I'll have it made
I'll have it made
I'll have it made



[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge]
All the, small things
True care, truth brings
I'll take, one lift
Your ride, best trip
Always, I know
You'll be, at my show
Watching, waiting
Commiserating

[Pre-Hook: Tom DeLonge]
Say it ain't so
I will not go
Turn the lights off
Carry me home

[Hook: Tom DeLonge]
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na

[Verse 2]
Late night, come home
Work sucks, I know
She left me roses by the stairs
Surprises let me know she cares

[Pre-Hook: Tom DeLonge]
Say it ain't so
I will not go
Turn the lights off
Carry me home

[Hook: Tom DeLonge]
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na

[Outro]
Say it ain't so
I will not go
Turn the lights off
Carry me home
Keep your head still
I'll be your thrill
The night will go on
My little windmill
Say it ain't so (na na na na na na na)
I will not go (na na na na na na na)
Turn the lights off (na na na na na na na)
Carry me home (na na na na na na na)
Keep your head still (na na na na na na na)
I'll be your thrill (na na na na na na na)
The night will go on (na na na na na na na)
The night will go on (na na na na na na na)

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Call me, oh-oh, call me

Call me, call me any, any time



[Verse 1]
Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

Once I had a love and it was divine
Soon found out I was losing my mind
It seemed like the real thing but I was so blind
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

[Chorus]
In between
What I find is pleasing and I'm feeling fine
Love is so confusing, there's no peace of mind
If I fear I'm losing you, it's just no good
You teasing like you do

[Verse 2]
Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

[Chorus]
Lost inside
Adorable illusion and I cannot hide
I'm the one you're using, please don't push me aside
We could've made it cruising, yeah

[Bridge]
Yeah, riding high
On love's true bluish light

[Verse 3]
Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out to be a pain in the ass
Seemed like the real thing only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

[Chorus]
In between
What I find is pleasing and I'm feeling fine
Love is so confusing, there's no peace of mind
If I fear I'm losing you, it's just no good
You teasing like you do

[Outro]



[Intro]

[Verse 1]
One way or another, I'm going to find ya
I'm gonna get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
One way or another I'm going to win ya
I'm gonna get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
One way or another I'm gonna see ya
I'm gonna, meet ya, meet ya, meet ya, meet ya
One day, maybe next week, I'm gonna meet you

[Chorus]
I will drive past your house

See who's hanging out

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
One way or another I'm gonna lose ya
I'm gonna give you the slip
A slip of the lip or another, I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna trick ya, I'll trick ya
One way or another I'm gonna lose ya
I'm gonna trick ya, trick ya, trick ya, trick ya
One way or another I'm gonna lose ya
I'm gonna give you the slip

I'll walk down the mall, stand over by the wall
Where I can see it all, find out who you call
Lead you to the supermarket checkout
Some specials and rat food, get lost in the crowd

[Outro]
One way or another I'm gonna get ya
I'll get ya, I'll get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
(Where I can see it all, find out who you call)
One way or another I'm gonna get ya
I'll get ya, I'll get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
(Where I can see it all, find out who you call)
One way or another I'm gonna get ya
I'll get ya, I'll get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
(Where I can see it all, find out who you call)



[Intro]

[Verse 1: Donald Roeser]
All our times have come
Here but now they're gone
Seasons don't fear the reaper
Nor do the wind, the sun or the rain (We can be like they are)

[Chorus: Donald Roeser]
Come on, baby
(Don't fear the Reaper) Baby, take my hand
(Don't fear the Reaper) We'll be able to fly
(Don't fear the Reaper) Baby, I'm your man

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2: Donald Roeser]
Valentine is done
Here but now they're gone
Romeo and Juliet
Are together in eternity (Romeo and Juliet)
40,000 men and women everyday (Like Romeo and Juliet)
40,000 men and women everyday (Redefine happiness)
Another 40,000 coming everyday (We can be like they are)

[Chorus: Donald Roeser]
Come on, baby
(Don't fear the Reaper) Baby, take my hand
(Don't fear the Reaper) We'll be able to fly
(Don't fear the Reaper) Baby, I'm your man

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3: Donald Roeser]
Love of two is one
Here but now they're gone
Came the last night of sadness
And it was clear she couldn't go on
The door was open and the wind appeared
The candles blew and then disappeared
The curtains flew and then he appeared
(Saying "don't be afraid")

[Alternative Chorus: Donald Roeser]
Come on, baby (And she had no fear)
And she ran to him (Then she started to fly)
She looked backward and said goodbye
(She had become like they are)
She had taken his hand (She had become like they are)
Come on, baby (Don't fear the Reaper)

[Outro]



[Verse 1: Donald Roeser]
Home in the valley, home in the city
Home isn't pretty, ain't no home for me
Home in the darkness, home on the highway
Home isn't my way, home I'll never be

[Pre-Chorus: Donald Roeser]
Burn out the day
Burn out the night
I can't see no reason to put up a fight
I'm livin' for givin' the devil his due

[Chorus: Donald Roeser]
And I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for you
I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for you

[Verse 2: Donald Roeser]
Time is the essence, time is the season
Time ain't no reason, got no time to slow
Time everlasting, time to play B-sides
Time ain't on my side, time I'll never know

[Pre-Chorus: Donald Roeser]
Burn out the day
Burn out the night
I'm not the one to tell you what's wrong or what's right
I've seen suns that were freezing and lives that were through

[Chorus: Donald Roeser]
And I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for you
I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for you

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Pre-Chorus: Donald Roeser]
Burn out the day
Burn out the night
I can't see no reason to put up a fight
I'm livin' for givin' the devil his due

[Chorus: Donald Roeser]
And I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for you
I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for you
I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for you
I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for you



[Verse]
With a purposeful grimace and a terrible sound
He pulls the spitting high-tension wires down
Helpless people on subway trains
Scream, bug-eyed, as he looks in on them
He picks up a bus and he throws it back down
As he wades through the buildings toward the center of town

[Chorus]
Oh, no, they say he's got to go
Go go, Godzilla, yeah
Oh, no, there goes Tokyo
Go go, Godzilla, yeah
Oh, no, they say he's got to go
Go go, Godzilla, yeah
Oh, no, there goes Tokyo
Go go, Godzilla, yeah
Godzilla (zilla, zilla, zilla...)
Oh, no, they say he's got to go
Go go, Godzilla, yeah
Oh, no, there goes Tokyo
Go go, Godzilla, yeah

[Outro]
History shows again and again how nature points up the folly of man
Godzilla!
History shows again and again how nature points up the folly of man
Godzilla!
History shows again and again how nature points up the folly of man
Godzilla!
History shows again and again how nature points up the folly of man
Godzilla!



[Verse 1: Donald Roeser]
That night, her kiss told me it was over
I walked out late into the dark
The misty gloom seems to soak up my sorrow
The further I went on, I felt a spreading calm
Then suddenly my eyes were bathed in a light
And the lovely lady in white was by my side
She said, "Like me, I see you're walking alone -
Won't you please stay?"
I couldn't look away

[Chorus: Donald Roeser]
She said I love the night
The day is okay and the sun can be fun
But I live to see those rays slip away
I love the night
There's so much that I can show and give to you
If you will welcome me tonight
If only you had been there, my dear
We could have shared this together

[Verse 2: Donald Roeser]
No mortal was meant to know such wonder
One look in the mirror told me so
Come darkness, I'll see her again
Yes I'm gonna go, 'cause now I know

[Chorus: Donald Roeser]
I love the night
The day is okay and the sun can be fun
But I live to see those rays slip away

[Outro: Donald Roeser]
I love the night
I love the night
I love the night



Well, I'm a gonna raise a fuss, I'm a gonna raise a holler
I've been working all summer just to try and earn a dollar
Well, I went to the boss, said I got a date
The boss said "No Dice, son, you gotta work late"

Sometimes I wonder, what am I gonna do
There ain't no cure for the summertime blues

Well, my mom and poppa told me, "Son you gotta earn some money
If you want to use the car to go out next Sunday"
Well, I didn't go to work, I told the boss I was sick
He said "You can't use the car cause you didn't work a lick"

Sometimes I wonder, what am I gonna do
There ain't no cure for the summertime blues

Gonna take two weeks, gonna have a fine vacation
Gonna take my problems to the United Nations
Well, I went to my congressman, he said, quote
"I'd like to help you son but you're too young to vote"

Sometimes I wonder, what am I gonna do
There ain't no cure for the summertime blues



[Intro]
Woohoo!
Woohoo!
Woohoo!
Woohoo!

[Verse 1]
I got my head checked
By a jumbo jet
It wasn't easy
But nothing is, no

[Chorus]
(Woohoo!) When I feel heavy metal
(Woohoo!) And I'm pins and I'm needles
(Woohoo!) Well, I lie and I'm easy
All of the time but I'm never sure why I need you
Pleased to meet you

[Verse 2]
I got my head done
When I was young
It's not my problem
It's not my problem

[Chorus]
(Woohoo!) When I feel heavy metal
(Woohoo!) And I'm pins and I'm needles
(Woohoo!) Well, I lie and I'm easy
All of the time but I'm never sure why I need you
Pleased to meet you

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah



Nobody feels any pain
Tonight as I stand inside the rain
Everybody knows that baby’s got new clothes
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls
She takes just like a woman, yeah she does
She makes love just like a woman, yeah she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl

Queen Mary, she’s my friend
Yes, I believe I’ll go see her again
Nobody has to guess that baby can’t be blessed
'Til she sees finally that she’s like all the rest
With her fog, her amphetamine and her pearls
She takes just like a woman, yes
She makes love just like a woman, yeah, she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl

Yeah, it was raining from the first
And I was dying there of thirst
So I came in here
And your long-time curse hurts
But what’s worse
Is this pain in here
I can’t stay in here
Ain’t it clear that

I just can’t fit
Yes, I believe it’s time for us to quit
But when we meet again, introduced as friends
Please don’t let on that you knew me when
I was hungry and it was your world
Ah, you fake just like a woman, yes, you do
You make love just like a woman, yes, you do
Then you ache just like a woman
But ya' break just like a little girl

(Instrumental)



[Verse 1]
Mama, take this badge from me
I can't use it anymore
It's getting dark, too dark to see
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door

[Chorus]
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door

[Verse 2]
Mama, put my guns in the ground
I can't shoot them anymore
That cold black cloud is comin' down
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door

[Chorus]
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door

[Spoken: Josh Richman]
You just better start sniffing your own rank subjugation, Jack
Because it's just you against your tattered libido
The bank and the mortician, forever, man
And it wouldn't be luck, if you could get out of life alive

[Chorus]
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door



Once upon a time you dressed so fine
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People'd call, say "Beware doll, you're bound to fall"
You thought they were all kiddin' you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging for your next meal

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

You've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But you know you only used to get juiced in it
And nobody has ever taught you
How to live on the street
And now you find out you're gonna have
To get used to it
You said you'd never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say, do you want to make a deal?

How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

You never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns
When they all did tricks for you
You never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal

How does it feel
How does it feel
To have on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts and things
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse
When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?



[Verse 1]
You got a lot of nerve
To say you are my friend
When I was down
You just stood there grinning

[Verse 2]
You got a lot of nerve
To say you got a helping hand to lend
You just want to be on
The side that’s winning

[Verse 3]
You say I let you down
You know it’s not like that
If you’re so hurt
Why then don’t you show it?

[Verse 4]
You say you lost your faith
But that’s not where it’s at
You had no faith to lose
And you know it

[Verse 5]
I know the reason
That you talk behind my back
I used to be among the crowd
You’re in with

[Verse 5]
Do you take me for such a fool
To think I’d make contact
With the one who tries to hide
What it don’t know to begin with

[Verse 6]
You see me on the street
You always act surprised
You say “How are you? Good luck!”
But you don’t mean it

[Verse 7]
When you know as well as me
You’d rather see me paralyzed
Why don’t you just come out once
And scream it

[Verse 8]
No, I do not feel that good
When I see the heartbreaks you embrace
If I was a master thief
Perhaps I’d rob them

[Verse 9]
And now I know you’re dissatisfied
With your position and your place
Don’t you understand
It’s not my problem

[Verse 10]
I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
And just for that one moment
I could be you

[Verse 11]
Yes, I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
You’d know what a drag it is
To see you



[Verse 1]
Johnny's in the basement, mixin' up the medicine
I'm on the pavement, thinkin' about the government
The man in the trench coat, badge out, laid off
Says he's got a bad cough, wants to get it paid off
Look out kid, it's somethin' you did
God knows when, but you're doin' it again
You better duck down the alleyway, looking for a new friend
The man in the coon-skin cap in a pig pen
Wants eleven dollar bills - you only got ten

[Verse 2]
Maggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot
Talkin' that the heat put plants in the bet book
Phone's tapped anyway
Maggie says "The Man, he say
They must bust in early May, orders from the D.A."
Look out kid, don't matter what you did
Walk on your tip toes, don’t tie no bows
Better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose, watch the plainclothes
You don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows

[Verse 3]
Oh, get sick, get well, hang around a ink well
Hang bail, hard to tell if anything is gonna sell
Try hard, get barred, get back, ride rail
Get jailed, jump bail, join the Army if you fail
Look out kid, you're gonna get hit
By losers, cheaters, six-time users
Hanging 'round the theaters
Girl by the whirlpool's looking for a new fool
Don't follow leaders, a'watch the parking meters

[Verse 4]
Oh, get born, keep warm
Short pants, romance
Learn to dance, get dressed
Get blessed, try to be a success
Please her, please him, buy gifts
Don't steal, don't lift
20 years of schoolin' and they put you on the day shift
Look out kid, they keep it all hid
Better jump down a manhole, light yourself a candle
Don't wear sandals, try to avoid the scandals
Don't want to be a bum, you better chew gum
The pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles



[Verse 1]
Early one morning the sun was shining
I was laying in bed
Wondering if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red
Her folks they said our lives together
Sure was going to be rough
They never did like Mama's homemade dress
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough
And I was standing on the side of the road
Rain falling on my shoes
Heading out for the East Coast
Lord knows I've paid some dues
Getting through
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 2]
She was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam, I guess
But I used a little too much force
We drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out West
Split up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best
She turned around to look at me
As I was walking away
I heard her say over my shoulder
"We'll meet again someday
On the avenue"
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 3]
I had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But I never did like it all that much
And one day the ax just fell
So I drifted down to New Orleans
Where I lucky was to be employed
Working for a while on a fishing boat
Right outside of Delacroix
But all the while I was alone
The past was close behind
I seen a lot of women
But she never escaped my mind
And I just grew
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 4]
She was working in a topless place
And I stopped in for a beer
I just kept looking at the side of her face
In the spotlight, so clear
And later on, when the crowd thinned out
I was just about to do the same
She was standing there, in back of my chair
Said to me "Don't I know your name?"
I muttered something underneath my breath
She studied the lines on my face
I must admit, I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces
Of my shoe
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 5]
She lit a burner on the stove
And offered me a pipe
"I thought you'd never say hello" she said
"You look like the silent type"
Then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century
And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like burning coal
Pouring off of every page
Like it was written in my soul
From me to you
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 6]
I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs
There was music in the cafes at night
And revolution in the air
Then he started into dealing with slaves
And something inside of him died
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside
And when it finally, the bottom fell out
I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keeping on
Like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 7]
So now I'm going back again
I got to get to her somehow
All the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now
Some are mathematicians
Some are carpenter's wives
Don't know how it all got started
I don't know what they're doing with their lives
But me, I'm still on the road
A-heading for another joint
We always did feel the same
We just saw it from a different point of view
Tangled up in blue

[Chorus]
No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry

[Verse 1]
I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
Oba, observing the hypocrites
As they would mingle with the good people we meet
Good friends we have had, oh good friends we've lost along the way (way)
In this bright future you can't forget your past
So dry your tears I say

[Chorus]
No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry
Little darling don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry

[Verse 2]
Said, said, said I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
And then Georgie would make the fire light
As if it was log wood burning through the night
Then we would cook corn meal porridge
Of which I'll share with you
My feet is my only carriage
So I've got to push on through
But while I'm gone

[Bridge]
Everything's going to be alright
(x 8)
So woman don't cry
No, woman
(No woman, no cry)
Oh my little sister, don't shed no tears
(No Woman, no cry)
Yeah

[Guitar breakdown]

[Verse 3]
I  said I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
And then Georgie would make the fire light
As if it was log wood burning through the night
Then we would cook corn meal porridge
Of which I'll share with you
My feet is my only carriage, yah
So I've got to push on through
But while I'm gone

[Bridge 2]
No woman, no cry
I said: no woman, no cry
Ooh sister, don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry
Woman no cry, don't shed no tears
No woman no cry


[Chorus]
Little darling, don't shed no tears
No woman no cry
Little sister, don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry



[Verse 1]
One Love! One Heart!
Let's get together and feel all right
Hear the children crying (One Love!)
Hear the children crying (One Heart!)
Saying: give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right
Saying: let's get together and feel all right. Wo wo-wo wo-wo!

[Verse 2]
Let them all pass all their dirty remarks (One Love!)
There is one question I'd really love to ask (One Heart!)
Is there a place for the hopeless sinner
Who has hurt all mankind just to save his own beliefs?
Believe me

[Verse 3]
One Love! What about the one heart? One Heart!
What about - ? Let's get together and feel all right
As it was in the beginning (One Love!)
So shall it be in the end (One Heart!)
All right!
Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right
Let's get together and feel all right
One more thing!

[Verse 4]
Let's get together to fight this Holy Armagiddyon (One Love!)
So when the Man comes there will be no, no doom (One Song!)
Have pity on those whose chances grows thinner
There is no hiding place from the Father of Creation

"Don't worry about a thing
Cause every little thing is gonna be alright
Singing: "Don't worry about a thing
Cause every little thing is gonna be alright!"

[Chorus 2]
Rise up this morning
Smiled with the rising sun
Three little birds
Pitch by my doorstep

Of melodies pure and true
Saying, "This is my message to you"

Seems like yesterday
But it was long ago
Janey was lovely, she was the queen of my nights
There in darkness with the radio playin' low

And the secrets that we shared
Mountains that we moved
Caught like a wildfire out of control
'Til there was nothing left to burn and nothing left to prove

And I remember what she said to me
How she swore that it never would end
I remember how she held me oh so tight
Wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then

Against the wind
We were running against the wind
We were young and strong
We were running against the wind

The years rolled slowly past
And I found myself alone
Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends
Found myself further and further from my home and I

Guess I lost my way
There were oh so many roads
I was livin' to run and running to live
Never worried about payin' or even how much I owe

Movin' eight miles a minute for months at a time
Breakin' all of the rules that would bend
I began to find myself searchin'
Searchin' for shelter again and again

Against the wind
Little somethin' against the wind
I found myself seekin' shelter against the wind

Well, those drifters days are past me now
I've got so much more to think about
Deadlines and commitments
What to leave in, what to leave out

Against the wind
I'm still running against the wind
I'm older now but still running against the wind
Well, I'm older now and still running
Against the wind
Against the wind
Against the wind
Still running
Against the wind
I'm still running against the wind
Against the wind
I'm still running
Against the wind
I'm still running against the wind
Against the wind
Still running
Against the wind
Running against the wind, running against the wind
Against the wind
See the young man run
Against the wind
Watch the young man run
Against the wind
Watch the young man runin'
Against the wind
He'll be runnin' against the wind
Against the wind
Let the cowboys ride
Against the wind
Mm
Against the wind
Let the cowboys ride
Against the wind
They'll be ridin' against the wind
Against the wind
Against the wind
Against the wind
Ridin' against the wind
Against the wind
Against the wind



Have you heard the news
It's all over town
If you ain't heard it boys
You better sit down

I got the story here
It's hot off the press
Brace yourself now
And take a deep breath
Grob a hold of something
Hold on tight
Betty Lou's gettin' out tonight

First heard the rumor down on 12th and Main

The poor druggist he was going insane
His stuff is selling out like never before
He finally had to up and close the store

All the boys were getting ready to fight
Betty Lou's gettin' out tonight
Betty Lou's gettin' out tonight
Betty Lou's gettin' out tonight
She was bad
Her momma got mad
But now her momma said it's all right
All the boys are getting ready and right
Betty Lou's gettin'out tonight

Betty Lou
Betty Lou
It's all true
It's really true
What do you think about that boys



If the sun
Ain't shinin bright
And the moon the moon
Won't shine for you tonight
If thr stars in the sky gone away
And you feel
Feelin real slow down today
If life gets hard to understand
And the whole thing is getting out of hand
Come to Poppa
Come see your poppa

If you need a pacifier
Call me anytime
I'll try to be your satisfier
If you feel
Like a horse
Blazin' at the bit
Call my number
Anytime night or day
I'll get ya fixed
If life gets hard to understand
And your whole life is way out ofhand
Come to Poppa
Come see your poppa



[Verse 1]
I take my card and I stand in line
To make a buck I work overtime
Dear Sir letters keep coming in the mail
I work my back till it's racked with pain
The boss can't even recall my name
I show up late and I'm docked
It never fails

I feel like just another
Spoke in a great big wheel
Like a tiny blade of grass
In a great big field

[Verse 2]
To workers, I'm just another drone
To Ma Bell, I'm just another phone
I'm just another statistic on a sheet
To teachers, I'm just another child
To IRS, I'm just another file
I'm just another consensus on the street

Gonna cruise out of this city
Head down to the sea
Gonna shout out at the ocean
Hey it's me

[Refrain]
And I feel like a number
Feel like a number
Feel like a stranger
A stranger in this land
I feel like a number
I'm not a number
I'm not a number
Dammit I'm a man
I said I'm a man

[Musical interlude]

Gonna cruise out of this city
Head down to the sea
Gonna shout out at the ocean
Hey it's me

[Refrain]
And I feel like a number
Feel like a number
Feel like a stranger
A stranger in this land
I feel like a number
I'm not a number
I'm not a number
Dammit I'm a man
I feel like a number
Feel like a number
Feel like a number
Feel like a number



{Intro}

Here comes old Rosie she's looking mighty fine
Here comes hot Nancy she's steppin' right on time
There go the street lights bringin on the night
Here come the men faces hidden from the light
All through the shadows they come and they go
With only one thing in common
They got the fire down below

Here comes the rich man in his big long limousine
Here comes the poor man all you got to have is green
Here comes the banker and the lawyer and the cop
One thing for certain it ain't never gonna stop
When it all gets too heavy
That's when they come and go
With only one thing in common
They got the fire down below

It happens out in Vegas, happens in Moline
On the blue blood streets of Boston
Up in Berkeley and out in Queens
And it went on yesterday and it's going on tonight
Somewhere there's somebody ain't treatin' somebody right

And he's looking out for Rosie and she's looking mighty fine
And he's walking the streets for Nancy
And he'll find her every time
When the street light flicker bringing on the night
Well they'll be slipping into darkness slipping out of sight
All through the midnight
Watch 'em come and watch 'em go
Oh, c'mon
With only one thing in common
They got the fire down below

{outro}

Burning down below



I still remember it was autumn and the moon was shinin'
My '60 Cadillac was rollin' through Nebraska whinin'
Doin' a hundred twenty, man the fields was bendin' over
Headin' out for the mountains knowin' we was travelin' further
All our fires were blazin'
And the spinnin' wheels were turnin' turnin'
Had my girl beside me brother brother she was burnin' burnin'

Up walked  a Baptist preachin' southern funky school teacher
She had a line on something heavy but we couldn't reach her
We told her that we needed something that would get us goin'
She put out all she had and laid it on the counter showin'
All I had to do was lay my money down and pick it up
The cops came bustin' in
And then we lit out in a pickup truck and go

Get out of Denver better go go
Get out of Denver better go
Get out of Denver better go go
Get out of Denver cause you look just like a commie
And you might just be a member baby
Get out of Denver baby
Get out of Denver

Well the red lights were flashin'
And the sirens were a screamin' screamin'
We had to pinch each other just to see if we were dreamin'
Made it to Loveland Pass in under less than half an hour
Lord it started drizzlin' and it turned into a thunder shower

The rain was drivin' but the Caddy kept on burnin' rubber
We kept on drivin' till we ran through some fog for cover
We couldn't see a thing, somehow we just kept on goin'
We kept on drivin' all night long and then into the mornin'
Fog had finally lifted when we looked to see where we was at
We're starrin' at a Colorado state policeman trooper captain
He said ...

Get out of Denver better go go
Get out of Denver better go
Get out of Denver better go go
Get out of Denver cause you look just like a commie
And you might just be a member baby
Get out of Denver baby
Get out of Denver



She's totally committed
To major independence
But she's a lady through and through
She gives them quite a battle
All that they can handle
She'll bruise some
She'll hurt some too
But oh they love to watch her strut
Oh they do respect her but
They love to watch her strut

Sometimes they'll want to leave her
Just give up and leave her
But they would never play that scene
In spite of all her talking
Once she starts in walking
The lady will be all they ever dreamed
Oh they'll love to watch her strut
Oh they'll kill to make the cut
They love to watch her strut

Yeah love to watch her strut
Watch her strut



{Intro}

She stood there bright as the sun on that California coast
He was a Midwestern boy on his own
She looked at him with those soft eyes, so innocent and blue
He knew right then he was too far from home
He was too far from home

She took his hand and she led him along that golden beach
They watched the waves tumble over the sand
They drove for miles and miles up those twisting, turning roads
Higher and higher and higher they climbed

And those Hollywood nights
In those Hollywood hills
She was looking so right
In her diamonds and frills
Oh those big city nights
In those high rolling hills
Above all the lights
She had all of her skills

{Bridge}

He'd headed west cause he felt that a change would do him good
See some old friends, good for the soul
She had been born with a face that would let her get her way
He saw that face and he lost all control
He had lost all control

Night after night, day after day, it went on and on
Then came that morning he woke up alone
He spent all night staring down at the lights on LA
Wondering if he could ever go home

And those Hollywood nights
In those Hollywood hills
She was looking so right
It was giving him chills
In those big city nights
In those high rolling hills
Above all the lights
With a passion that kills

In those Hollywood nights
In those Hollywood hills
She was looking so right
In her diamonds and frills
Oh those big city nights
In those high rolling hills
Above all the lights
She had all of her skills

In those Hollywood nights....



Wally's getting' anxious thinkin' 'bout tonight
Bruce is all spiffy lookin' wicked lookin' right
Eddie's getting' spruced
And Donna's getting' loose
Theyre passin' round the bottle
And they're gettin' good and juiced
B.G.'s winin' dinin' checkin' talent at the club
Skippers hauntin' second lookin' forward to his rub
The busters from the country
And the hitters from the shop
Everybody wants to do the Horizontal Bop

Someone bring the records
Someone get the brew
Someone get a house
Buddy we'll know what to do
Someone tell the ladies
Someone make a deal
If we can't find a house
Then someone better find a field

Grass is good as carpet
Anyplace is fine
Its time to get to rockin'
Babe it's time to make it shine
Tell 'em we'll be dancin'
Dancin' till we drop
It's time to get down and do the Horizontal Bop

Theyre fillin' up the corners
Theyre fillin' up the streets
You can feel the tension
You can almost feel the heat
The music's gettin' louder
The beat's gittin' fast
Summers finally made it
Yeah its finally here at last

The pony cars are cruisin' on Woodward Avenue
Go and try to pass'em
They'll smoke you if you do
The whole town's shakin' from the bottom to the top
Everybody wants to do the Horizontal Bop
The busters from the country
And the hitters from the shop
Everybody wants to do the Horizontal Bop
Tell 'em we'll be dancin'
Dancin' till we drop
Everybody wants to do the Horizontal Bop



Intro

I think I'm going to Katmandu
That's really, really where I'm going to
If I ever get out of here
That what I'm gonna do

K-k-k-k-k-k-Katmandu
I think it's really where I'm going to
If I ever get out of here
I'm going to Katmandu

I got no kick against the west coast
Warner Brothers are such good hosts
I raise my whiskey glass and give 'em a toast
I'm sure they know it's true

I got no rap against the southern states
Every time I been there it's been great
But now I'm leaving and I can't be late
And to myself be true

That's why I'm going to Katmandu
Up to the [mount?], that's where I'm going to
Hey, if I ever get out of here
That's what I'm gonna do

Whoa, Katmandu
Really, really where I'm going to
If I ever get out of here
I'm going to Kathmandu

I got no quarrel with the Midwest
The folks out there have given me their best
I've lived there all my life, I've been their guest
I sure have loved it, too

I'm tired of looking at the TV news
I'm tired of driving hard and paying dues
I figure, baby, I got nothing to lose
I'm tired of being blue

Oh, that's why I'm going to Katmandu
Up to the mountains where I'm going to
If I ever get out of here
That's what I'm gonna do

K-k-k-k-k-k-Katmandu
Take me baby, cause I'm going with you
If I ever get out of here
I'm going to Katmandu

{Bridge}

I ain't got nothin' 'gainst the east coast
You want some people, well they got the most
New York City's like a friendly old ghost
You seem to cruise right through

I know I'm gonna miss the USA
I guess I'll miss it every single day
But no one loves me here any way
I know my plane is due

The one that's going to Katmandu
Up to the mountains where I'm going to
If I ever get out of here
That's what I'm gonna do

K-k-k-k-k-k-Katmandu
Really, really, really going  to
If I ever get out of here
If I ever get out of here
If I ever get out of here
I'm goin' to Katmandu

Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Yeah

{Outro}

(Katmandu, Katmandu, Katmandu....)



I remember standing on the corner at midnight
Trying to get my courage up
There was this long lovely dancer in a little club downtown
I loved to watch her do her stuff
Through the long lonely nights she filled my sleep
Her body softly swaying to that smoky beat
Down on mainstreet

In the pool halls, the hustlers and the losers
I used to watch 'em through the glass
Well I'd stand outside at closing time
Just to watch her walk on past
Unlike all the other ladies, she looked so young and sweet
As she made her way alone down that empty street
Down on mainstreet

And sometimes even now, when I'm feeling lonely and beat
I drift back in time and I find my feet
Down on mainstreet
Down on mainstreet



[Chorus: ENKEI]
It hurt you though

[Verse 1: DALiii]
Yeah
It was never nothing personal
Why you had to make it so public?
Your moves are ceasing out
You get hot and cold but we ain’t public
You know I used to hate it
Let’s face it
I was only in it to hit it
I never loved it
Let’s face it
You too stuck up in your feelings
You never saw that
I played you
You ain’t gotta say please for me to come back
Do I gotta be mean for you to fall back
I ain’t gon’ change I’m a savage
Everywhere I go, I leave damage
Any girl who’s [?] for the challenge
But I never touch a bitch if she average

[Chorus: ENKEI]
It hurt you though
It hurt me though
Was nothing new

[Verse 2: Touxh & ENKEI]
I’m on a mission, I ain’t even in the top five
The shit I did last night
Not personal
We making jungle moves
For the wildlife
There’s nothing much I do, that makes you proud
Ay
My name is Touxh if you don’t know
I got my crew here, never solo
Take my time to perfect like a [?]
But the shit you doin’, is always overboard
Baby
You’re everything I’ve ever wished for
There’s nothing about you, that I don’t adore
You pretty smart and your laugh’s kinda cute too
We here now, just forget about your past tu
I’m nothing like him girl, I won’t desert you
We can one dance, to that Drake song
And we can stay flexi, njenge dance move
It was nothing personal

[Chorus: ENKEI]
It hurt you though

[Verse 3: Sash]
I wanna leave
Ah, can I stay for you
And when I leave, I wanna pave the way for you
I don’t wanna have to run away from you
You came too early, I was late for you
A pool of niggas, I wasn’t even [?] for you
Yet you still wanna say I was made for you
You don’t love me even though you say you do
You don’t think you do, I say you do
It’s going down
You’re breaking down
I’m flaking now
You’re caking now
I leave you when it’s not safe around
A lot of niggas is out here staking out
I see you though
You do the most
I love you though
I know you know
You know for sure
I know you know
I know you know
I know you know

[Chorus: ENKEI]

It was nothing personal
It was nothing personal
It was nothing personal



[Verse 1]
Just take those old records off the shelf
I'll sit and listen to 'em by myself
Today's music ain't got the same soul
I like that old time rock 'n' roll

[Verse 2]
Don't try to take me to a disco
You'll never even get me out on the floor
In ten minutes I'll be late for the door
I like that old time rock 'n' roll

[Chorus]
Still like that old time rock 'n' roll
That kind of music just soothes my soul
I reminisce about the days of old
With that old time rock 'n' roll

[Verse 3]
Won't go to hear 'em play a tango
I'd rather hear some blues or funky old soul
There's only one sure way to get me to go
Start playing old time rock 'n' roll

[Verse 4]
Call me a relic, call me what you will
Say I'm old-fashioned, say I'm over the hill
Today's music ain't got the same soul
I like that old time rock 'n' roll

[Chorus] [4x]

[Outro]
Still like that old time rock 'n' roll!



Yeah, I'm gonna tell my tale come on, uh come on, give a listen
Cause I was born lonely down by the riverside
Learned to spin fortune wheels and throw dice
I was just thirteen when I had to leave home
Knew I couldn't stick around
I had to roam, ain't good lookin'
But you know I ain't shy
Ain't afraid to look you girl, hey in the eye
So if you need some lovin' and you need it right away
Take a little time out and maybe I'll stay

But I got to ramble (Ramblin' man)
Gamble (Gamblin' man)
Got to, got to ramble (ramblin' man)
E
I was born a ramblin', gamblin' man

Yeah, uhh, say, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hah, hah
A bring it on, come on now
Yeah, alright, here we go now

Now, I'm out of money, 'cause you know I need some
Ain't gonna run on lovin' and I must run
Got to keep movin', never gonna slow down
You can have your funky world, see you 'round
Cause I got to ramble (Ramblin' man)
I got to gamble (gamblin' man)
I got to ramble (ramblin' man)
Lord I'm a ramblin', gamblin' man

Oh! I'm just a rambler
Yeah! and I'm just a gambler
Come on and sing along
'Cause I'm just a rambler (ramblin' man)
Lord I'm a gambler (gamblin' man)
I'm a rambler



So you're a little bit older and a lot less bolder
Than you used to be
So you used to shake 'em down
But now you stop and think about your dignity
So now sweet sixteens turned thirty-one
You get to feelin' weary when the work days done
Well all you got to do is get up and into your kicks
If you're in a fix
Come back baby
Rock and roll never forgets
You better get yourself a partner
Go down to the concert or the local bar
Check the local newspapers
Chances are you won't have to go too far
Yeah the rafters will be ringing cause the beat's so strong
The crowd will be swaying and singing along
And all you got to do is get in into the mix
If you need a fix
Come back baby
Rock and roll never forgets
Oh the bands still playing it loud and lean
Listen to the guitar player making it scream
All you got to do is just make that scene tonight
Heh tonight

Well now sweet sixteens turned thirty-one
Feel a little tired feeling under the gun
Well all Chuck's children are out there playing his licks
Get into your kicks
Come back baby
Rock 'n Roll never forgets
Said you can come back baby
Rock 'n Roll never forgets



Took a look down a westbound road
Right away I made my choice
Headed out to my big two-wheeler
I was tired of my own voice
Took a bead on the northern plains
And just rolled that power on

Twelve hours out of Mackinac City
Stopped in a bar to have a brew
Met a girl and we had a few drinks
And I told her what I'd decided to do

She looked out the window a long long moment
Then she looked into my eyes
She didn't have to say a thing
I knew what she was thinkin'

Roll, roll me away
Won't you roll me away tonight
I too am lost, I feel double-crossed
And I'm sick of what's wrong and what's right
We never even said a word
We just walked out and got on that bike
And we rolled
And we rolled clean out of sight

We rolled across the high plains
Deep into the mountains
Felt so good to me
Finally feelin' free

Somewhere along a high road
The air began to turn cold
She said she missed her home
I headed on alone

Stood alone on a mountain top
Starin' out at the Great Divide
I could go east, I could go west
It was all up to me to decide
Just then I saw a young hawk flyin'
And my soul began to rise
And pretty soon
My heart was singin'

Roll, roll me away
I'm gonna roll me away tonight
Gotta keep rollin', gotta keep ridin'
Keep searchin' till I find what's right
And as the sunset faded I spoke
To the faintest first starlight
And I said next time
Next time
We'll get it right



You always won, everytime you placed a bet
You're still damn good, no one's gotten to you yet
Everytime they were sure they had you caught
You were quicker than they thought
You'd just turn your back and walk
You always said, the cards would never do you wrong
The trick you said was never piay the game too long
A gambler's share, the only risk that you would take
The only loss you could forsake
The only bluff you couldn't fake

And you're still the same
I caught up with you yesterday
Moving game to game
No one standing in your way
Turning on the charm
Long enough to get you by
You're still the same
You still aim high

There you stood, everybody watched you play
I just turned and walked away
I had nothing left to say

'Cause you're still the same
You're still the same
Moving game to game
Some thlngs never change
You're still the same



She packed up her bags and she took off down the road
Left me here stranded with the bills she owed
She gave me a false address
Took off with my American Express
Sunspot Baby
She sure had me way outguessed

She left me here stranded like a dog out in the yard
Charged up a fortune on my credit card
She used my address and my name
Man that was sure unkind
Sunspot Baby
She sure has a real good time

I looked in Miami
I looked in Negril
The closest I came was a month old bill
I checked the Bahamas and they said she was gone
I can't understand why she did me so wrong

But she packed up her bags
And she took off down the road
Said she was going to visit sister Flo
She used my address and my name
And man that was sure unkind
Sunspot Baby
I'm gonna catch up sometime
Sure had a real good time



{Intro}

Here comes old Rosie she's looking mighty fine
Here comes hot Nancy she's steppin' right on time
There go the street lights bringin on the night
Here come the men faces hidden from the light
All through the shadows they come and they go
With only one thing in common
They got the fire down below

Here comes the rich man in his big long limousine
Here comes the poor man all you got to have is green
Here comes the banker and the lawyer and the cop
One thing for certain it ain't never gonna stop
When it all gets too heavy
That's when they come and go
With only one thing in common
They got the fire down below

It happens out in Vegas, happens in Moline
On the blue blood streets of Boston
Up in Berkeley and out in Queens
And it went on yesterday and it's going on tonight
Somewhere there's somebody ain't treatin' somebody right

And he's looking out for Rosie and she's looking mighty fine
And he's walking the streets for Nancy
And he'll find her every time
When the street light flicker bringing on the night
Well they'll be slipping into darkness slipping out of sight
All through the midnight
Watch 'em come and watch 'em go
Oh, c'mon
With only one thing in common
They got the fire down below

{outro}

Burning down below



Up with the sun, gone with the wind
She always said I was lazy
Leaving my home, leaving my friends
Running when things get too crazy
Out to the road, out 'neath the stars
Feeling the breeze, passin' the cars

Women have come, women have gone
Everyone trying to cage me
Some were so sweet, I barely got free
Others, they only enraged me
Sometimes at night, I see their faces
I feel the traces they've left on my soul
Those are the memories that made me a wealthy soul
I tell you, those are the memories that made me a wealthy soul

Travelin' man, love when I can
Turn loose my hand 'cause I'm goin'
Travelin' man, love when I can
But sooner or later I'm goin' on
Travelin' man, travelin' man

Sometimes at night, I see their faces
I feel the traces they've left on my soul
Those are the memories that made me a wealthy soul
Tell you, those are the memories that make me a wealthy soul



Without a warning you took my heart
You took it darling, tore it apart
You left me sittin in the dark, cryin'
Said your love for me was dyin'
I don't believe it, I think you outta turn it up
Turn on your love light
Turn it on up
Just a little bit

I get a little lonely
In the middle of the night
I need your lovin'
Make it all right
I need your love girl
Or else I ain't all right
I need your lovin'
Or else I ain't all right
Bring it to me now
Bring it to me now
Bring it home darlin'
An turn it on up now
Just a little bit
A little bit
Turn it up a bit



[Verse 1]
On a long and lonesome highway east of Omaha
You can listen to the engines moaning out its one old song
You can think about the woman, or the girl you knew the night before
But your thoughts will soon be wandering the way they always do
When you are riding sixteen hours and there's nothing much to do
You don't feel much like riding, you just wish the trip was through

[Chorus]
But here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
There I go, playing the star again
There I go, turn the page

[Verse 2]
You walk into this restaurant, strung out from the road
And you feel the eyes upon you, as you're shaking off the cold
You pretend it doesn't bother you, but you just want to explode
And most times you can't hear them talk, other times you can
All the same old cliches: is it woman? Is it man?
And you always seem outnumbered, you dare not make a stand, make your stand

[Chorus]
But here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
There I go, playing the star again
There I go, turn the page

[Verse 3]
Out there in the spotlight, you're a million miles away
Every ounce of energy, you try to give away
And the sweat pours out your body, like the music that you play
Later in the evening, as you lie awake in bed
With the echoes of the amplifiers, ringing in your head
You smoke the day's last cigarette, remembering what she said
What she said

[Chorus]
But here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
There I go, playing the star again
There I go, turn the page

[Outro]
There I go, turn that page
There I go, yeah, there I go, yeah
There I go, yeah, Here I go
There I go, there I go
And I'm gone



I know it's late, I know you're weary
I know your plans don't include me
Still here we are, both of us lonely
Longing for shelter from all that we see
Why should we worry, no one will care girl
Look at the stars so far away
We've got tonight, who needs tomorrow?
We've got tonight babe
Why don' you stay?
Deep in my soul
I've been so lonely
All of my hopes, fading away
I've longed for love, like everyone else does
I know I'll keep searching, even after today
So there it is girl, I've said it all now

And here we are babe, what do you say?
We've got tonight, who needs tomorrow?
We've got tonight babe
Why don't you stay?
I know it's late, I know you're weary
I know your plans don't include me
Still here we are, both of us lonely
Both of us lonely
We've got tonight, who needs tomorrow?
Let's make it last, let's find a way
Turn out the light, come take my hand now
We've got tonight babe
Why don't you stay?
Why don't you stay?



A gypsy wind is blowin' warm tonight
The sky is starlit and the time is right
And still you're tellin' me you have to go
Before you leave there's something you should know
Yeah something you should know babe

I've seen you smilin' in the summer sun
I've seen your long hair flying when you run
I've made my mind up that it's meant to be
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me

Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Out where the rivers meet the soundin' sea
You're high above me now, you're wild and free
Ah but someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me

Some people say that love's a losin' game
You start with fire but you lose the flame
The ashes smolder but the warmth's soon gone
You end up cold and lonely on your own

I'll take my chances babe, I'll risk it all
I'll win your love or I'll take the fall
I've made my mind up girl it's meant to be
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me

Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
It's written down somewhere, it's got to be
You're high above me flyin' wild and free
Oh but someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me

Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Out where the rivers meet the sounding sea
I feel it in my soul, it's meant to be
Ohh someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me



[Verse 1]
It's the same kind of story
That seems to come down from long ago
Two friends having coffee together
When something flies by their window
It might be out on that lawn
Which is wide, at least half of a playing field
Because there's no explaining what your imagination
Can make you see and feel

[Chorus]
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized

[Verse 2]
Now it's not a meaningless question
To ask if they've been and gone
I remember a talk about North
Carolina and a strange, strange pond
You see the sides were like glass
In the thick of a forest without a road
And if any man's ever made that land
Then I think it would've showed

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
They say there's a place down in Mexico
Where a man can fly over mountains and hills
And he don't need an airplane or some kind of engine
And he never will
Now you know it's a meaningless question
To ask if those stories are right
Because what matters most if the feeling

[Outro]
You get when you're hypnotized
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
Yeaaaaahhhh
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
Seems like a dream
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized



[Chorus]
Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can
Cure my disease

[Verse 1]
I ain't got a fever got a permanent disease
It'll take more than a doctor to prescribe a remedy
I got lots of money but it isn't what I need
Gonna take more than a shot to get this poison out of me
I got all the symptoms count them 1,2,3
First you need
That's what you get for falling in love
Then you bleed
You get a little but it's never enough
On your knees
That's what you get for falling in love
And now this boy's addicted cause your kiss is the drug

[Chorus]
Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can
Cure my disease
Bad, bad medicine [x2]

[Verse 2]
I don't need no needle
To be giving me a thrill
And I don't need no anesthesia
Or a nurse to bring a pill
I got a dirty down addiction
It doesn't leave a track
I got a jolt for your affection
Like a monkey on my back
There ain't no paramedic
Going to save this heart attack
When you need
That's what you get for falling in love
Then you bleed
You get a little but it's never enough
On your knees
That's what you get for falling in love
Now I'm addicted and your kiss is the drug

[Chorus]
Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Shake it up, just like bad medicine
So let's play doctor, baby
Cure my disease
Bad, bad medicine [x2]

[Verse 3]
I need a respirator cause I'm running out of breath
You're an all night generator wrapped is stockings and a dress
When you find your medicine you take what you can get
Cause if there's something better baby well they haven't found it yet

[Chorus]
Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can
Cure my disease
Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Shake it up, just like bad medicine
Your love's the potion that
Can cure my disease
Bad, bad medicine [x2]



[Verse 1]
I wake up in the morning and I raise my weary head
I've got an old coat for a pillow, and the earth was last night's bed
I don't know where I'm goin', only God knows where I've been
I'm a devil on the run, a six gun lover, a candle in the wind

[Verse 2]
When you're brought into this world, they say you're born in sin
Well at least they gave me somethin', I didn't have to steal or have to win
Well they tell me that I'm wanted, yeah, I'm a wanted man
I'm colt in your stable, I'm what Cain was to Abel, Mr. Catch-Me-If-You-Can

[Chorus 1]
I'm goin' down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm goin' out in a blaze of glory
And, Lord, I never drew first, but I drew first blood
I'm no one's son, call me young gun

[Verse 3]
You ask about my conscience and I offer you my soul
You ask If I'll grow to be a wise man, well I ask if I'll grow old
You ask me if I've known love and what it's like to sing songs in the rain
Well, I've seen love come, I've seen it shot down, I've seen it die in vain

[Chorus 2]
Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
'Cause I'm goin' out in a blaze of glory
Lord, I never drew first but I drew first blood
I'm the devil's son, call me young gun

[Bridge]
Each night I go to bed, I pray the Lord my soul to keep
No I ain't lookin' for forgiveness, but before I'm six foot deep
Lord, I gotta ask a favor, and I'll hope you'll understand
'Cause I've lived life to the fullest, let this boy die like a man
Starin' down a bullet, let me make my final stand

[Chorus 2]
Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm goin' out in a blaze of glory
Lord, I never drew first but I drew first blood
And I'm no one's son, call me young gun
I'm a young gun
Young gun
Young gun



[Verse 1]
Rainy night and we worked all day
We both got jobs because there's bills to pay
We got something they can't take away
Our love, our lives
Close the door, leave the cold outside
I don't need nothing when I'm by your side
We got something that'll never die
Our dreams, our pride

[Chorus]
My heart beats like a drum (all night)
Flesh to flesh, one to one (and it's alright)
And I'll never let go cause
There's something I know deep inside
You were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man

[Verse 2]
We got something to believe in
Even if we don't know where we stand
Only God would know the reasons
But I bet he must have had a plan
Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man
Light a candle, blow the world away
Table for two on a TV tray
It ain't fancy, baby that's OK
Our time, our way
So hold me close better hang on tight
Buckle up, baby, it's a bumpy ride
We're two kids hitching down the road of life
Our world, our fight

[Chorus]
If we stand side by side (all night)
There's a chance we'll get by (and it's alright)
And I'll know that you'll be live
In my heart till the day that I die
Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man

[Verse 3]
We got something to believe in
Even if we don't know where we stand
Only God would know the reasons
But I bet he must have had a plan
Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man

[Chorus]
My heart beats like a drum (all night)
Flesh to flesh, one to one (and it's alright)
And I'll never let go cause
There's something I know deep inside
Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man
We got something to believe in
Even if we don't know where we stand
Only God would know the reasons
But I bet he must have had a plan
Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man
You were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man



[Verse 1]
If you're ready, I'm willing and able
Help me lay my cards out on the table
You're mine and I'm yours for the taking
Right now the rules we made are meant for breaking
What you get ain't always what you see
But satisfaction's guaranteed
They say what you give is always what you need
So if you want me to lay my hands on you

[Chorus]
Lay your hands on me [x7]

[Verse 2]
I'm a fighter, I'm a poet, I'm a preacher
I've been to school and baby, I've been the teacher
If you show me how to get up off the ground
I can show you how to fly and never ever come back down
Everything you want is what I need
Satisfaction's guaranteed
But the ride don't never ever come for free
If you want me to lay my hands on you

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Don't you know I only aim to please
If you want me to lay my hands on you
Lay your hands on me



[Intro]
Once upon a time
Not so long ago

Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike
He's down on his luck it's tough
So tough
Gina works the diner all day
Working for her man
She brings home her pay for love
For love

She says, "We've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot"
Ohh, we're half way there
Oh-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Oh-oh, livin' on a prayer

Tommy's got his six string in hock
Now he's holding in
When he used to make it talk
So tough, ooh it's tough
Gina dreams of running away
When she cries in the night
Tommy whispers "Baby it's okay
Someday"

We've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot

Ohh, We're half way there
Livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Livin' on a prayer
Livin' on a prayer

Ooh we've got to hold on, ready or not
You live for the fight when it's all that you've got

We're half way there
Livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Livin' on a prayer
We're half way there
Livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Livin' on a prayer
We're half way there
Livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear



[Verse 1]
You - you got a nasty reputation
We're in a sticky situation - it's down to me and you
So tell me - is it true. They say there ain't nobody better
Well now that we're together
Show me what you can do
You're under the gun
Out on the run
Going to set the night on fire
You're out on the run
Under the gun
And playing to win

[Chorus]
Raise your hands
When you want to let it go
Raise your hands
And you want to let a feeling show
Raise your hands
From New York to Chicago
Raise your hands
From New Jersey to Tokyo
Raise your hands

[Verse 2]
I - I've been out on the front line
Where you'll go down if you waste time
They'll walk all over you
But I - I ain't here looking for surrender
I'll raise the flag if you'll defend her
It's up to you
You're under the gun
Out on the run
Going to set the night on fire
You're out on the run
Under the gun
And playing to win

[Chorus]



[Verse 1]
On the street where you live girls talk about their social lives
They're made of lipstick, plastic and paint, a touch of sable in their eyes
(All your life) all your life all you've asked when's your daddy gonna talk to you
But you were living in another world trying to get your message through

[Chorus 1]
No one heard a single word you said
They should have seen it in your eyes
What was going around your head

[Chorus 2]
Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things she couldn't say
Ooh, she's a little runaway

[Verse 2]
Take a line every night guaranteed to blow your mind
I see you out on the streets, calling for a wild time
So you sit home alone cause there's nothing left that you can do
There's only pictures hung in the shadows left there to look at you
You know she likes the lights at nights on the neon Broadway signs
She don't really mind, it's only love she hoped to find

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2][x3]



[Verse 1]
What more can I do, there's nothing I haven't tried
Still it's so hard for her to notice
I've tried hard to be straight
There's nothing left I can say
If only she would look my way

[Chorus]
She don't know me, she don't know
She don't see me, she don't care
She can't hear me, can't hear
Can not help me, she don't want
She don't want me like I want her
Like I wan't her got to tell her
Got to tell her that I love her
That I love her
She doesn't even know my name

[Verse 2]
I dream of when she'll be mine
I dream of crossing that line
And holding her so tender
Dreaming it could come true
So many things I would do
If only you'd give me a chance

[Chorus]



[Verse 1]
It's all the same, only the names will change
Everyday it seems we're wasting away
Another place where the faces are so cold
I'd drive all night just to get back home

[Hook]
I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted dead or alive
Wanted dead or alive

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I sleep, sometimes it's not for days
And the people I meet always go their separate ways
Sometimes you tell the day by the bottle that you drink
And times when you're alone all you do is think

[Hook]
I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted, wanted, dead or alive
Wanted (wanted) dead or alive

[Break]
Alive

[Guitar Solo]

[Hook - variation]
I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted (wanted) dead or alive

[Verse 3]
I walk these streets, a loaded six string on my back
I play for keeps, 'cause I might not make it back
I been everywhere, still I'm standing tall
I've seen a million faces and I've rocked them all!

[Outro]
`Cause I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted (wanted) dead or alive
And I'm a cowboy
I got the night on my side
And I'm wanted (wanted) dead or alive
And I ride (and I ride), dead or alive
I still drive (still drive), dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive



[Intro]
Shot through the heart and you're to blame
Darling, you give love a bad name

[Verse 1]
An angel's smile is what you sell
You promise me heaven, then put me through hell
Chains of love, got a hold on me
When passion's a prison, you can't break free
Whoa! You're a loaded gun
Yeah, whoa, there's nowhere to run
No one can save me, the damage is done

[Chorus]
Shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name
Yeah you give love a bad name

[Verse 2]
Paint your smile on your lips
Blood red nails on your fingertips
A school boy's dream, you act so shy
Your very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye
Whoa! You're a loaded gun
Whoa! There's nowhere to run
No one can save me, the damage is done

[Chorus]
Shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name
Yeah you give love a bad name

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name
Shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name
You give love
You give love a bad name
You give love
You give love a bad name
You give love
You give love a bad name
You give love



Gone tomorrow, one day closer to your heart
Lost around me, is time in itself when you're near
Take the time, I'll show you the love I've for you
You're too young, to know what it is that I feel

All that I can do is wait for you...Just wait for you
All that I can do is wait for you...Just wait for you

Full of sorrow, your eyes are too wide and too new
All I know is these feelings I get when you're near
Keep in mind, I can't give you love without fear
You're too young, I don't know what's keeping me here

All that I can do is wait for you...Just wait for you
All that I can do is wait for you...Just wait for you

All that I can do is wait for you...Just wait for you
All that I can do is wait for you...Just wait for you
All that I can do...ooooooh...oooooooooh...

[Verse 1]
If I said what's on my mind
You'd turn and walk away
Disappearing way back in your dreams
It's so hard to be unkind
So easy just to say
That everything is just the way it seems

[Chorus]
You look up at me
And somewhere in your mind you see
A man I'll never be
If only I could find a way
I'd feel like I'm the man you believe I am
And it's getting harder every day for me
To hide behind this dream you see
A man I'll never be

[Verse 2]
I can't get any stronger
I can't climb any higher
You'll never know just how hard I've tried
Cry a little longer
And hold a little tighter
Emotions can't be satisfied

[Chorus]



[Verse 1]
Babe, tomorrow's so far away
There's something I just have to say
I don't think I can hide what I'm feelin' inside
Another day, knowin' I love you
And I, I'm getting too close again
I don't want to see it end
If I tell you tonight will you turn out the light
And walk away knowing I love you?

[Chorus]
I'm going to take you by surprise and make you realize
Amanda
I'm going to tell you right away, I can't wait another day
Amanda
I'm going to say it like a man and make you understand
Amanda
I love you

And I feel like today's the day
I'm lookin' for the words to say
Do you wanna be free, are you ready for me
To feel this way
I don't wanna lose you
So, it may be too soon, I know
The feeling takes so long to grow
If I tell you today will you turn me away
And let me go?
I don't want to lose you

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
You and I
I know that we can't wait
And I swear, I swear it's not a lie girl
Tomorrow may be too late
You, you and I girl
We can share a life together
It's now or never
And tomorrow may be too late

[Outro]
And, feeling the way I do
I don't wanna wait my whole life through
To say I'm in love with you



[Verse 1]
Now I like taking off
Don't like burning out
Every time you turn it on
Makes me want to shout
We keep getting hotter
Moving way too fast
If we don't slow this fire down
We're not going to last

[Chorus 1]
Cool the engines
Red line's getting near
Cool the engines
Better take it out of gear

[Chorus 2]
I'm no fool
I'm going to keep it cool
And take it day by day
We won't know where we might go
Until we take it all the way

[Verse 2]
Take me for a ride
Take me all the way
Take me where I've never been
Someplace I can stay
Don't get yourself too hot
Don't get yourself too high
If we don't take it easy now
We can kiss it all goodbye

[Chorus 1]
Cool the engines
Slow this rocket down
Cool the engines
Why don't you take a look around

[Chorus 2]
I'm no fool, going to keep it cool
Take it day by day
We won't know where we might go
Until we take it all the way

[Bridge]
Cool the engines
Cool the engines
Going over the line
Going off the dial
Running out of time
And it's getting wild
Got flashing lights
Going round and round
Until we get it right
Better cool it down
Better cool it down

Cool the engines

[Verse 3]
And now we're on our way
No need to hurry just to get from day to day
And I, oooh, I know
We don't have to run that hard to get where we can go

[Outro]
Cool the engines
Cool the engines down
Cool the engines
Cool the engines down



Don't look back, ooh a new day is breakin'
It's been too long since I felt this way
I don't mind ooh where I get taken
The road is callin', today is the day

I can see, it took so long just to realize
I'm much too strong not to compromise
Now I see what I am is holding me down
I'll turn it around, oh yes I will

I finally see the dawn arrivin'
I see beyond the road I'm drivin'

It's a bright horizon and I'm awakin' now
Oh I see myself in a brand new way
The sun is shinin' ooh the clouds are breakin'
Cause I can't lose now, there's no game to play

I can tell there's no more time left to criticize
I've seen what I could not recognize
Everything in my life was leading me on
But I can be strong, oh yes I can

I finally see the dawn arrivin'
I see beyond the road I'm drivin'
Far away and left behind, left behind

Oh the sun is shinin'
And I'm on my road

Don't look back, ooh a new day is breakin'
It's been so long since I felt this way
I don't mind ooh where I get taken
The road is callin', today is the day

I can see, it took so long just to realize
I'm much too strong not to compromise
Now I see what I am is holding me down
I'll turn it around, oh yes I will

I finally see the dawn arriving
I see beyond the road I'm driving
Far away and left behind

Don't look back
Don't look back
Don't look back
Don't look back



[Verse 1]
Well come on
All you people
The time has come to get together
You gotta have a little rock 'n' roll music
To get you through the stormy weather
And do whatever you feel
When you let go
Nothing's gonna help you more than rock 'n' roll

[Chorus]
So come on, put you hands together
You know it's now or never
Take a chance on rock 'n' roll

[Verse 2]
Ooo are you feeling satisfied
Come on let us give your mind a ride
Ooo are you ready tonight
Come on let us give your mind a ride You can do what you like
Come on let us give your mind a ride

[Verse 3]
Oh that funky feeling
Is what you need to get you through
You oughta know
I'll tell you something
Don't let your troubles get to you
Cause win or lose it's alright
Well take control
And nothing's gonna help you more than rock 'n' roll

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Ooo are you feeling satisfied
Come on let us give your mind a ride
Ooo are you ready tonight
Come on let us give your mind a ride You can do what you like
Come on let us give your mind a ride



[Foreplay Instrumentation]

[Long Time]

[Verse 1]
It's been such a long time
I think I should be goin', yeah
And time doesn't wait for me, it keeps on rollin'
Sail on, on a distant highway
I've got to keep on chasin' a dream
I've gotta be on my way
Wish there was something I could say

[Hook]
Well I'm takin' my time, I'm just movin' along
You'll forget about me after I've been gone
And I take what I find, I don't want no more
It's just outside of your front door

It's been such a long time. It's been such a long time

[Verse 2]
Well I get so lonely when I am without you
But in my mind, deep in my mind
I can't forget about you
Good times, and faces that remind me
I'm tryin' to forget your name and leave it all behind me
You're comin' back to find me

[Hook]

It's been such a long time. It's been such a long time

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Yeah. It's been such a long time, I think I should be goin', yeah
And time doesn't wait for me, it keeps on rollin'
There's a long road, I've gotta stay in time with
I've got to keep on chasin' that dream, though I may never find it
I'm always just behind it

Well I'm takin' my time, I'm just movin' along
Takin' my time, just movin' along
Takin' my time, yeah I'm takin' my time...



[Verse 1]
Day is night in New York City
Smoke, like water, runs inside
Steel idle trees to pity
Every living thing that's died

[Hook]
Going to hitch a ride
Head for the other side
Leave it all behind
Never change my mind
Going to sail away
Sun lights another day
Freedom on my mind
Carry me away for the last time
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Life is like the coldest winter
People freeze the tears I cry
Words of hail their minds are into
I've got to crack this ice and fly

[Hook]

[Organ Solo]

[Guitar Solo]

[Hook]



[Verse 1]
Now I'm not like this, I'm really kind of shy
But I get this feeling whenever you walk by
I don't want to down you, I want to make you high
If you you could see your way to me, come on and let me try

[Hook]
Let me take you home tonight
Mamma now it's alright
Let me take you home tonight
I'll show you sweet delight

[Verse 2]
You must understand this, I've watched you for so long
That I feel I've known you, I know it can't be wrong
If we just get together, I want to make you see
I'm dreaming of your sweet love tonight, so mamma let it be

[Hook]

I don't want to make excuses, I don't want to lie
I just got to get loose
With you tonight

[Guitar Solo]

[Hook]

I don't want to make excuses, I don't want to lie
I just got to get loose
With you tonight

[Verse 3]
I don't want to down you, I want to make you high
And I get this feeling whenever you walk by
If we just get together, I want to make you see
I'm dreamin' of your sweet love tonight, so mamma let it be

[Hook]

I wanna show you sweet delight, show you sweet delight
Pretty mamma want to show you sweet delight

Let me take you home tonight
You know I want to take you home
Let me take you home tonight
I don't want be alone
Let me take you home tonight
Let me take you home tonight
Let me take you home tonight



[Verse 1]
I looked out this morning and the sun was gone
Turned on some music to start my day
I lost myself in a familiar song
I closed my eyes and I slipped away

[Chorus]
It's more than a feeling (more than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play (more than a feeling)
I begin dreaming (more than a feeling)
'Till I see Marianne walk away
I see my Marianne walkin' away

[Verse 2]
So many people have come and gone
Their faces fade as the years go by
Yet I still recall as I wander on
As clear as the sun in the summer sky

[Chorus]
It's more than a feeling (more than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play (more than a feeling)
I begin dreaming (more than a feeling)
'Till I see Marianne walk away
I see my Marianne walkin' away

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
When I'm tired and thinking cold
I hide in my music, forget the day
And dream of a girl I used to know
I closed my eyes and she slipped away

She slipped away

[Chorus]
It's more than a feeling (more than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play (more than a feeling)
I begin dreaming (more than a feeling)
'Till I see Marianne walk away
I see my Marianne walkin' away



[Verse 1]
Oh yeah, well you know I don't get off on working day after day
I wanna have some fun while I'm here
I play the game when its going my way
And theres nothing like a party when its kicking into gear

Im getting ready for a party tonight
Yes Im getting ready to cruise
And if you've got something for me
Ive got something for you

[Chorus]
Baby, its a party and nobody cares
What we're doing there
Baby, its a party as long as you're there
Its a party, party, party

[Verse 2]
I can't believe it when some people say
That it's a sin that way we live to die
You know, there's never been a more natural thing
There's a brand new story, but it's the same old lie

So come on get ready for the time of your life
Cause I'm getting right in the groove
And if you've got something for me
Ive got something for you

[Chorus]
So come on, oh come on, let's go get down

[Verse 3]
Get down and party if you need a cue
You're sure to find one in the crowd
Just meet your friends and have a toke or two
In a place where they can never play the music too loud

And get ready for a party tonight
Cause Im getting right in the groove
And if you've got something for me
Ive got something for you

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Now a man doesn't live on bread alone
He's got to have some loving each and every night
And a woman's got to have it if the truth be known
Let's get together honey, it's alright
I said, let's get together honey, it's alright
So come on, let's get together honey, it's alright

[Outro]
Aww, get down
Get down and party



[Verse 1]
Now if your feelin' kinda low 'bout the dues you've been payin'
Future's comin' much too slow
And you wanna run but somehow you just keep on stayin'
Can't decide on which way to go

[Hook]
I understand about indecision
But I don't care if I get behind
People living in competition
All I want is to have my peace of mind

[Verse 2]
Now you're climbing to the top of the company ladder
Hope it doesn't take too long
Can't you see there'll come a day when it won't matter
Come a day when you'll be gone

[Hook]
I understand about indecision
But I don't care if I get behind
People living in competition
All I want is to have my peace of mind

Take a look ahead
Take a look ahead
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
Well everybody's got advice they just keep on givin'
Doesn't mean too much to me
Lots of people have to make believe they're livin'
Can't decide who they should be

[Hook]
I understand about indecision
But I don't care if I get behind
People living in competition
All I want is to have my peace of mind

Take a look ahead
Take a look ahead
Look ahead!



[Verse 1]
Well, we were just another band out of Boston
On the road to try to make ends meet
Playin' all the bars, sleepin' in our cars
And we practiced right on out in the street
No, we didn't have much money
We barely made enough to survive
But when we got up on stage and got ready to play
People came alive

[Hook]
Rock and roll band, everybody's waitin'
Gettin' crazy, anticipating love and music
Play, play, play
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Dancin' in the streets of Hyannis
We were getting pretty good at the game
People stood in line and didn't seem to mind
You know everybody knew our name
Livin' on rock-n-roll music
Never worry 'bout the things we were missing
When we got up on the stage and got ready to play
Everybody'd listen

[Hook]

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Playin' for a week in Rhode Island
A man came to the stage one night
He smoked a big cigar
Drove a Cadillac car
And said "Boys, I think this band's outta sight"
Sign a record company contract
You know I've got great expectations
When I hear you on the car radio
You're goin' to be a sensation!"

[Hook]



[Verse 1]
We're gonna play you a song, a little bit of rock-n-roll
You gotta let yourself go, the band's gonna take control
We're gettin' down today
We'll pick you up and take you away
Get down tonight

[Hook]
Smokin', smokin'
We're cookin' tonight, just keep on tokin'
Smokin', smokin'
I feel alright, mamma I'm not jokin', yeah

[Verse 2]
Get your feet to the floor, everybody rock and roll
You've got nothing to lose just the rhythm and blues, that's all, yeah
We're gonna feel okay
We'll get you up and take you away
Get down tonight

[Hook]
Smokin', smokin'
We're cookin' tonight, just keep on tokin'
Smokin', smokin'
I feel alright, mamma I'm not jokin', yeah

[Organ Solo]

[Verse 3]
Everyone's jumpin', dancin' to a boogie tonight
Clap your hands, move your feet
If you don't you know it won't seem right
We're gettin' down today
We'll pick you up and take you away
Get down tonight
We'll pick you up and take you away
Get down tonight
Alright!



When I was younger I thought I could stand on my own
It wasn't easy, I stood like a man made of stone

[Hook]
But there was something about you
I want you to know
It brought a change over me
It's startin' to show
I've got this feelin' inside
Gotta have ya, have ya, ain't no good to hide

It isn't easy
To show what I'm feeling inside, girl
It isn't easy
I know, when you believe in a man like me

When I get angry I say things I don't want to say
I really mean it, I don't want to leave you this way
I couldn't help my reaction
I want you to know
I lose control over you
I just want you to know
Got this feeling inside
Gotta have ya, have ya, ain't no good to hide

It isn't easy
To show what I'm feeling inside, girl
It isn't easy
I know, when you believe in a man like me

[Guitar Solo 1]

[Hook]

It isn't easy
To show what I'm feeling inside, girl
It isn't easy
I know, to believe in a man like me
Like me, can't you see
I got to, got to have you

[Guitar Solo 2]

But there was something about you
Yeah there was something about you



Wow, I hope you're ready for a wild ride, cause I'm gonna warm you up for Pedro and Randy and you never know what's gonna be coming, so this is truly a treat and I want to talk about four significant phone calls in my life. The first was getting drafted by the Detroit Tigers. A dream that a hometown kid would have. The second one was not the best of phone calls, it was getting traded by the Detroit Tigers to the Atlanta Braves, the worst team in all of baseball at the time.

The third was very significant and I will touch on it later, but it was a call from Tommy John, encouraging me to continue with my career at the age of thirty-four. The fourth call is not something I ever dreamed about. I don't know, I can't speak for the rest of the Hall of Famers, but on January Sixth when I got the call letting me know that I had been inducted into the Hall of Fame, well words and emotions could not describe. The phone rang, I was just thankful that Greg Maddux had not put up the ultimate prank in letting me know that this was not for real. Thankfully they told me quickly that I had made it.

So I truly want to thank the Hall of Fame, Jane Forbes Clark and Jeff Idelson, for what they've done in preserve the character of this great Hall. For Brad Horn, for Whitney,  all the people behind the scenes making this like the perfect wedding, orchestrating it to the fullest. And of course the baseball writers of America. Your votes obviously got me to this point, I cannot thank you enough.

To Randy, Pedro, and Craig: I will never forget this class. It is a class that I have had the utmost respect for each and every one of them. Of course Craig I've competed the most against. It's hard to believe that I've never competed against Randy Johnson, I can't say that I'm sorry. But I don't think we ever hooked up.

I had a seat in the bullpen when he pitched his perfect game as I was the closer for the Braves and actually half-heartedly started to warm up in the ninth cause it was only a two to nothing game knowing full well I didn't think I was gonna get in that game. But at 6' 10", he is truly the freak that mastered a game in a way that no other could. And in a weird way, with Pedro Martinez being on the opposite end of the spectrum and me kinda fit in the middle at six-foot-three, it shows why baseball is a game of all sizes and shapes, and why it is truly America's pastime.

Craig's the teammate that you always wanted and the guy you never wanted to play against. And Pedro, you got me in a lot of trouble facing you in my career. You were the most dominant pitcher I'd ever seen. It was Bugs Bunny, and in today's world it was basically Nintendo or any kind of game you watch - that's the kind of stuff you had. I got fined a hundred dollars for check-swinging and hurting my wrist against you, and... thanks a lot.

Well, I'm gonna try to do it backwards. I'm gonna do the tough part first. And I never thought I'd ever read a speech, but for the sake of time I'm going to. I want you to know that the best way to describe my career is unique. I can't think of another word. It's unique in every way, and I have fingerprints all over my career by those who've touched me and impacted me and have helped me along the way. It is a huge army that got John Smoltz from Lansing, Michigan to where I am today.

I'm not gonna touch on all of them, I'm gonna do that in a personal way. There's too many people to thank, and I know that I will forget  somebody but I will take care of you on the back end, I promise. But I will be talking about some who made it possible to reach this dream.

To my wife Kathryn, the hardest thing to do is when we met six years ago, is transition from a baseball career to retirement. As Craig mentioned, this life is a great life but a cruel life, a tough one. And you made that transition so seamless, I can't even thank you enough. You took a blended family, and you made them seem like your own. You love my kids as if they were your own. You saw me at my worst, trying to make a comeback with the Boston Red Sox after major shoulder surgery. And I truly could not have made it without you. Everything you did for this event, it's not possible, I'm letting you know right now. There's too many moving parts. I love you so much, you're where my place of comfort and peace really is. And I look forward to the future as a retired, well - broadcaster for the MLB Network as we transition our career.

To my kids Andrew, Rachel, Carly, and Kelly. I can't tell you what it's like for the journey of a major league player, you sacrifice so much. I love you very much. You've adjusted and adapted to the challenges in our life. It's not the perfect road, we knew it wouldn't be, and I've always tried to give you the best of what I had. I can't wait to see what God has for each and every one of you as you pursue your passions. Although be unique, they are your own. And I can't wait to see the families that you are able to raise as well.

To Sarah Catherine and Ashley, my two step-daughters. Can't imagine what you two were thinking when your mom and I got married and you were starting a whole new journey. Your willingness to adapt under twists and turns and your ability to just go with the flow. It seems like we've been meant to be together our whole lives. I can't thank you and know how much I love you guys.

To my mom and dad, this is where the story gets interesting. You did so much for me to get me to this point. You didn't know much about sports or baseball. You pretty much knew what you knew and that was playing the accordion cause that's how you guys met. You were accordion teachers, and I'm thankful for the opportunity that you started me on my quest to be the next Lawrence Welk at the age of four. I played till the age of seven, and then I hit you with the ultimate whopper of all whoppers at the age of seven. I said I know what I'm gonna be in life and I'm gonna be a Major League Baseball player.

You loved me enough to give me room to go after my dream. You didn't discourage me from leaving the accordion for Major League Baseball. You just told me to have a backup dream. And I did that as well. Even though it was a gas station attendant at the time, I thought that was pretty cool. I cannot imagine the odds and the way you must have felt when I told you that I was going to play in Major League Baseball. These things might have caused you to sway me in a different direction. But you not only allowed me to pursue this newfound passion of mine, you went on a mission to provide opportunities, to give me an opportunity to play this great game of baseball.

You served as a great example for me and all future parents that when your kid has a dream, no matter how outrageous or outlandish it might be, giving them a chance to pursue that is the greatest thing in life, and you put aside your own- what you knew, and what you thought would fall in the family line of tradition of great accordion players, and I can't thank you enough.

I'm proud... I'm proud of the way I grew up, the heritage in which we grew up, the polka music on the 8-track tapes, I enjoyed it all. You taught me so much to not be afraid of who I am, to live in the moment, to learn, to laugh, to cry. You gave me the characteristics and the morals by which today I live by, and I am so thankful.

Dad, you caught me my competitiveness. Your unwillingness to let me win at the age of four and five was relentless, but I thought it was great cause I could return the favor when I had a chance to. You taught me to honor God first, family second, school third, and sports fourth. You put the priorities where they needed to be and you stood by them. I thank you for that.

To my brother and sister, I can't thank you enough for sacrificing your summers. Thankfully we didn't grow up in Florida or warm weather where you fall prey to playing every day or all year. Two months in Michigan's long enough. But you sacrificed a lot more and your love for me, one year apart, a close-knit family, following my twenty-one year career, you there there at every turn and every time I needed you the most.

My extended family is the biggest army in the world and I can't thank them enough because of everything we did. It was close-knit, we had a blast. Yes, it always involved playing the accordion and dancing. One of the things I didn't ever do was dance, but I played the accordion and I can't thank you enough for the love that you have and I could not possibly repay you all.

To my extended family again, to my in-laws for just jumping on this ride and not knowing exactly what you're gonna get. This is a pretty cool ending so far, in the midst of my journey.

Now, my baseball journey began outside our home in Lansing, Michigan. I got a unique story, I already told you about the accordion. But I had a wild imagination. And before I go any further, Jeff Foxworthy, I'm not gonna tell any corny jokes, so relax, I could see you tense up as we speak right now. Relax, no jokes.

I started with a rubber ball and a brick wall. For those who know me, this will not come as a surprise. I was the GM, the manager, the pitching coach, the grounds crew, the play-by-play, you name it, in my mind I did it. And I would stand outside that wall in a generous strike zone and I would pitch the greatest games ever known to mankind. I'm a self-taught baseball player, I'm a Tiger fanatic growing up, and so I would watch somebody and emulate them immediately outdoors. Thankfully I did not have the technology that exists today that kinda distracts our attention to get outside and do that which we love.

I'm also happy to say that in all those big games that I pitched in my life, I won them all. I truly believed that if the moment were to get there, I would be a little kid on the mound, relishing in the fact that I get to do this. Cause I've already done it in my mind so many different times.

Growing up in Lansing was incredible, it's where my baseball career kinda took off. I had my best friend Chuck Catsparella, who we did everything together. We thought of games, we went outside, we were constantly doing whatever it took. For a lot of you in the stands that are not old enough you might not know what Strikeout is, but we played a lot of Strikeout and pickup baseball, and games that I'll never forget.

Aside from my family and Chuck, a guy that I call my second dad and I owe just a great gratitude to, could not make it today, he's at home in Lansing, Michigan hopefully watching, Carl Wagner. Dedicated over fifty years of his baseball life teaching and honoring kids, over fifty years he provided the opportunity for kids to go out and play the great game of baseball. He taught me to never be complacent, never think you've arrived, cause there's always somebody working harder, and trying to take your job and be better than you are. I can't thank you enough, Carl, and I love you.

Two other significant people from Lansing real quick, Javier Cavazos, same thing. Dedicates his life to teaching youths all over Lansing, and he has been a big influence on me, putting me in situations. And he may be one of the few people that I have been as a coach will understand, Pedro Martinez.

Because he told me at a game in Brooklyn, New York facing Brooklyn, New York where I gave up four two-run homers in a row in the fourth inning, one of the greatest moments in my life of learning. I'm not afraid to fail, and I learned from some of the greatest failure moments in my life. In Brooklyn, New York they were all yelling at me in Spanish. He came out and he said, "You wanna know what they said?" I said, "Yeah, you might as well tell me as you're taking me out." He said, "They were yelling to get [?] for your neck cause every time you threw a pitch you turned around and it was over the fence." Thank you Javier for your humility as well as your ability to teach kids.

For Phil Odlum, my high school and basketball coach, I had the two greatest years of my life. What you're gonna know about me is that I loved every minute of my life of where I grew up and where it ends, and where it's going. And Phil Odlum, you gave me the keys to lead a basketball or baseball team that I would take later and pursue that in my big league quest to be the best baseball player but the best teammate I possibly can.

To start with the draft, I gotta thank the Tigers for drafting me in the twenty-second round. I think I'm the latest draft pick to ever be in the Hall of Fame. And if it were not for the scouts, they're the backbone of our game, for seeing what I had and the motor that was ticking inside the 6' 3", 180-pound skinny kid, this all would not be possible.

Drafted by my hometown team was a dream come true as I said. I had a unique situation where I got drafted the last day before you go to college. Imagine getting drafted and going to the team you idolize and staying with them for 35 days in the big leagues. I got a chance to see what big leaguer life was- instead of going to rookie ball I went right with the big club, and got a chance to see what the heroes of my generation were doing in their locker room, in their home.

And I gotta say this: as odd, and as in awe as I was of these guys, I remember sitting in the locker room at Tiger Stadium, a fish out of water, scared to death. And a Hall of Famer in my mind, a guy that I will never forget in making the first impression in my big league career. Alan Trammell came up to me and said, "Hi, I am Alan Trammell. Anything I can do for you, don't hesitate to ask. This house is your house." And I will never forget. I thank you, Alan Trammell, for teaching me what a professional baseball player is all about.

It was as if he had introduced and gave me a baton and said now pay this forward every chance you can, because this game has a chance to impact a lot of people. And I have done that to the best of my ability thanks to Alan Trammell's imprint in my life. Just that five to twenty second time of his day he took to welcome a newcomer to the game.

I also want to thank a good friend of mine, Bruce Fields, taking me into an instructional league. Right after big leagues I went into an instructional league and I worked, 6' 3", 185. I went into the home of three veterans and they helped nurture me for the big leagues that I was about to take on that quest. And thanks to his wife Julie, they put twenty pounds on me, that instructional league that I desperately needed.

Now onto the trade. The trade, the most infamous trade I guess in Atlanta Braves history. I can't spend enough time talking about this gentleman. I will hear about it later, I know, from the fellow Hall of Famers that I respect but Bobby Cox is every single thing to me on why I stand up here today.

He was the general manager that took the chance and made the trade and got me over to Atlanta. And yes they were the worst team in baseball at the time. It was the most devastating time in my life but I realized that I would have an opportunity to pitch at a young age in an organization that desperately needed pitching.

I also used to only think about that trade as myself and what it did for me and Tom Glavine reminded me that that trade opened up a spot for him in the big leagues, and he never looked back. So I'm thankful that two-for-one worked out really well.

Bobby became my manager, he's the reason that I stayed in the organization for twenty years, I would rather go nowhere else. As I said time does not permit to tell you what an incredible manager- the history that I was able to watch. He empowered people, he gave you confidence when you didn't have it, he was a tremendous leader, and I owe a great amount of my career to this man.

Because of the faith that he had in me was the reason that I was able to make the transition from starter to closer, and then back to starter. He believed in everything that I did, he knew my personality. He allowed me to play golf, which always puts a smile on my face, and it's the reason that the three of us were able to play for as long as we did.

The starting rotation will be talked about for the rest of time and maybe always compared to things, but to do something and to make it come full circle. To talk about the two greatest teammates, the two greatest pitchers who got inducted, as I was sitting at the MLB Network watching them absolutely rip me a new one and enjoying every second of it, I thought we would go back in time and just do this for a second.

[Puts on a wig.]

Glav, Maddux, back when I had hair, we had the time of our lives. It's the only time, Greg, you're not going to be able to talk about my bald head. So what I want to talk about is the time that we had both playing golf and pitching. What you don't know about Greg and Tom is that you know that all the statistics got him here and they got them here for the Hall of Fame. But they did things behind the scenes for me that I will never, ever forget.

When I lost my changeup they were there helping me to find it. When I lost my golf book, which was the prized treasure of what I had because I was the golf concierge, they looked tirelessly and helped me find it. Recently I've lost twenty pounds, and they helped me find it. Thank you guys.

[Takes off wig.]

I cannot say enough about them and as time permits, obviously you know how much we have been together: Tommy for fifteen years and Greg for ten. To Chipper Jones, soon to be inducted in the Hall of Fame, another one of the Atlanta Braves. I'm not gonna say anything about him because he'll have the mic last. Would somebody please steal his Twitter account, please. That would help.

Thanks to all the trainers who worked so hard, I'm a miracle, I'm a medical miracle that stands before you today. I spent more time in the training room, I can't thank them for their patience, I know I drove them crazy. Dave Pursley, Jeff Porter, Jim Lovell, and everybody else that had a hand in my career. I can't thank you all enough, and like I said I hope to one day be able to give you something special.

To Chris Burnham, Peter Hughes, you were invaluable in my career, and crucial for the day-to-day, what it took to get to the mound. To all the doctors in Atlanta, I spent a lot of time counseling with you and seeing how it was gonna be possible to throw another pitch.

But one doctor I spent the most time, and the most passionate doctor as Tommy said last year and even Greg, Dr. Joe Chandler, there is no possible way that I could have done this without you, I can't thank you enough. You are everything that I could ask for in your profession. You watched the medical miracle keep existing. We had many times at your house, in your office, and I can't thank you enough for the time that you spent with me. It's invaluable.

To all the pitching coaches that I had, I had roving pitching coaches in Detroit, John Hiller and Ralph Treuel, thank you for bearing with the wild stallion. Thank you to Bruce Dal Canton, my first pitching coach. And then Roger McDowell of course, but my first encounter of Leo Mazzone was when I came over from the Detroit Tigers in the trade. He helped simplify my mechanics, simplify my ability to pitch. And with the throwing program that we were able to use over the last fifteen years of our career is the reason why we stayed so healthy. Thank you, Leo, for your patience and for your diligence in seeing something through and making it work.

To my good friend Greg Olson, who's here today. We hit it off right away, on the field and off. His upbeat attitude helped me get through so many of my tough games. I'll never forget him jumping in my arms against the Astros, sorry Greg, and the first time we were able to get to the playoffs. And he jumped into my arms, I never anticipated after going nine innings and he was pretty heavy but at that time he felt pretty light.

We got a chance to do it again in Game 7 after the unbelievable game of Steve Avery, 1-nothing gem in Pittsburgh. He jumped in my arms again and we were on to the World Series. This all happening after a 2-11 first start, and then Bobby's patience and faith of a 12-2 second half allowed this all to be possible. We never planned it, but however we were working on the trifecta in Game 7 against Jack Morris. We were one run away from that happening, it didn't happen, my idol growing up, Jack Morris ruined that incredible opportunity to have three times, you jumping in my arms. Thank you Oley for all that you did and what we continue to do in our friendship.

And all the catchers that I've had. I was not an easy person to catch. I can't thank them enough for their willingness to get me through a game. To Brian McCann, breaking him in, and now with the New York Yankees. It truly was a privilege to teach him what I had learned from a lot of the other catchers in our game.

To all my teammates, I can't name you enough, I thank you for what it was that we had in an incredible run. My goal in life was to be the teammate that I possibly can. That meant caring for you on and off the field, being their for you, doing my best to be prepared, laughing, joking, golfing, whatever it took. I cared about each and every one of them, that was our family away from our family, and we spent a lot of times and good times together.

A special thanks to the greatest center fielder that I've ever seen in Andruw Jones. Andruw Jones caught more fly balls that I threw than probably anybody else, and he was truly a pleasure to play behind.

To the Atlanta Braves organization, to wear this great uniform, and represent the great state of Georgia, I never took one day for granted. Wearing this uniform, I played every game as if it was my last. The Braves uniform became such a platform for not only your foundation, but my later foundation that I formed in the charities that we are able to touch. I can't wait to represent these organizations in the future as now representing the greatest team behind me in the Hall of Fame.

A special thank you to the Boston Red Sox for taking a chance on a broken-down guy recovering from a shoulder surgery, I can't thank you for that experience. Giving me another opportunity, although I did not do very well, I am so sorry for that. But giving me that opportunity, you showed me what another organization's view is like and the rich history that you had.

To the Saint Louis Cardinals, I will never thank you for giving me that chance after being released by the Boston Red Sox, and deservingly so by the way. For giving me an opportunity to end my career in what was an improbable and unbelievable fifteenth playoff season. For Tony La Russa,  I can't thank you for making me feel like one of your own, and entrusting me with the ball in some of the big moments. I will never forget these two organizations, because I would retire after wearing the Cardinals uniform in 2009.

Last but not least, I want to steal a little bit of what- I think Craig Biggio saw my speech, I wanted to thank the clubhouse guys. They are the heart and soul of our team. They are the heart and soul of every junk that we bring to them, and I watch these kids grow up from kids to adults to now having families. It started with Casey Stevenson, Chris Vanzant, Ben Acree to name a few. Bill Acree, for all the things you did away from the game, the game consumes you and you need things to be in the proper order and the right way. I can't thank you enough.

John Schuerholz, Terry McGuirk, and the whole Braves organization, you treated me with the family that I now have in Atlanta, and will forever live there, Lord willing. John Holland, Fred Stone, on the visiting side and the Spring training. I had so much fun with the guys behind the scenes because they never get enough time to be noticed or even know that they're there. And sometimes get treated in a way that doesn't represent what the game is.

Before I hand it over to the next inductee, I would be remiss if I did not talk about Tommy John. I've been given an opportunity as one of the only players, the only one right now to be inducted into the Hall of Fame with Tommy John surgery. It's an epidemic. It's something that is affecting our game. It's something that I thought would cost me my career, but thanks to Dr. James Andrews and all those before him, performing the surgery with such precision has caused it to be almost a false read like a band-aid you put on your arm.

I want to encourage the families and parents that are out there to understand that this is not normal to have a surgery at fourteen and fifteen years old. That you have time, that baseball's not a year-round sport. That you have an opportunity to be athletic and play other sports. Don't let the institutions that are out there running before you guaranteeing scholarship dollars and signing bonuses that this is the way.

We have such great, dynamic arms in our game that it's a shame that we're having one, and two, and three Tommy John recipients, so I want to encourage you if nothing else, know that your children's passion and desire to play baseball is something that they can do without a competitive pitch. Every throw a kid makes today is a competitive pitch, they don't go outside, they don't have fun, they don't throw enough. But they're competing in maxing out too hard, too early, and that's why we're having these problems. So please, take care of those great future arms.

To Tommy John, I can't thank you enough for the phone call, whether you were coerced or not, the phone call at the age of thirty-four meant the world to me. Emotionally, I'd given up. I had thought that no one would last and wait for a pitcher of my age on the last year of my contract. Thank you for encouraging me, that was pivotal part of my career, to push through what I thought might be a career ending.

At thirty-four and fourteen postseason years and two-hundred postseason innings, is one of the reasons I believe that Tommy John, besides genetics, had happened to me. But because of Dr. Andrews and his brilliance and the team that had been before him, I had the confidence that the surgery would work, and the rest would write its story.

Last but not least, or- close to last but not least, I want to thank Mike Nixon and Scott Runyon for taking our family up here in a plane, that was an absolute gift. And as you can see my family's huge, it takes an army. Thank you for your generosity.

Being inducted into the Hall of Fame is one of the greatest honors that I could have here on Earth. However, I know there's another one coming. The ultimate Hall of Fame. I want to thank God for the talent he has given me and the support system that I have. I would not be the man I am today if it were not for a couple people who sowed seeds into my life. Telling me about Christ and challenging me to take a deeper look into my faith.

Jose Alvarez, Marty Clary, Sid Bream, Terry Pendleton, the list could go on, they took the time to not care not so much about my talent but about the heart in the man that I would become. Jacky and Ken Kendall, Mike and Kia McCoy, Walt and Patti Wiley, and last Tim Cash and Barb.

These are the people, through the toughest times in my life, the intimacy of knowing what life has challenged you with. They've been in my every corner. And they've allowed me to know that I have more to live for than just the uniform that I was wearing. They gave me the greatest gift, to find my salvation in Christ and I can't thank you enough for caring so much to invest your time and your heart in me.

I have a unique group of men that meets every Thursday in JR's. Jeff Foxworthy and the likes of so many men who have through those days taught me the impact that I can make, just beyond wearing a uniform.

I'm so humbled to be a member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame. I'm honored by so many of my family members. To be here in Cooperstown is not something I ever dreamt. I know along the way I forgot some people, but in my baseball career I've been around two men that I would entrust my children with, I would leave my children with, who have represented me in baseball with the first class and dignity that I always wanted my parents to be proud of. Myles Shoda and Lonnie Cooper. I cannot thank you for taking care of my needs away from the game and representing my intentions and not yours. It is so vital.

To the guys that introduced me in transition to broadcasting, thank you for taking the time to take a simple-minded, no-vocabulary, accordion-playing player into transition to baseball. Thank you to the MLB Network, it started with TBS, and I can't thank them- think of another home that I'd rather be and take the abuse when I get back from a great organization like the MLB Network.

I think I've covered it all. I am thankful and honored and blessed. Thank you very, very much.



[Verse 1]
Just let me hear it from your lips
It's the last thing that I'll ask you to say
Don't wanna hear it from strangers
If it's over let me have it straight

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been used
But I'm takin' it like a man
I'm confused
But I'm doin' the best that I can

[Chorus]
I've been tossed around plenty before
I've had this heart of mine broken and more
I can't find a reason for sure
But I've gotten used to bad news
(can't find me a reason for sure)

[Verse 2]
Don't tell me why
Yes it's over I can see the end
But please don't lie
If you're leavin' me like a friend

[Chorus 2]
I've been tossed around plenty of times
And I've read between all the lines
You're just another in the grand design
And I've gotten used to bad news

[Verse 3]
I know what you're sayin' is bad
It's not what I wanted but I'm ready for that
I'm ready for that, yea

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]



[Verse 1]
I'm ready for more
The feelin' now that I'm beside you
We'll open the door
Do anything that we decide to

[Chorus]
And I know that there's something that's just out of sight
And I feel like I'm finally seeing the light
Holdin' on girl I know it's right
I know it's right
We're ready!

[Verse 2]
You and I
We'll find a reason
To simplify a change of season

[Chorus]
And I feel like it's time we were off on our way
We can go so much farther than we've come today
Holdin' on girl and come what may
Come what may
We're ready! Come on!

We can find a way

[Verse 3]
We're ready now
Catchin' a wave to ride on
Steady now
Heading where we decide on

[Chorus]
And I know that there's something that's just out of sight
And I feel like we're trying to do something right
Come on make it if we hold on tight
Hold on tight
We're Ready! C'mon We're ready
We're ready
We're ready, 1...2...3...4...

[Outro]
We can find a way
We're ready now, oooh, we're ready now
We're ready now, oooh



{Intro}

Lido missed the boat that day he left the shack
But that was all he missed and he ain't comin' back
A tombstone bar in a jukejoint car, he made a stop
Just long enough to grab a handle off the top
Next stop Chi town, Lido put the money down and let it roll

He said one more job ought to get it
One last shot 'fore we quit it
One more for the road

Lido, whoa-oh-oh-oh
He's for the money, he's for the show
Lido's waitin' for the go
Lido, whoa-oh-oh-oh
He said one more job ought to get it
One last shot 'fore we quit it
One more for the road

Lido be runnin', havin' great big fun, until he got the note
Sayin' toe the line or blow, and that was all she wrote
He be makin' like a beeline, headin' for the borderline
Goin' for broke

Sayin' one more hit ought to do it
This joint ain't nothin to it
One more for the road

Lido, whoa-oh-oh-oh
He's for the money, he's for the show
Lido's waitin' for the go
Lido, whoa-oh-oh-oh
He said one more job ought to get it
One last shot 'fore we quit it
One more for the road

{Bridge}

Lido, whoa-oh-oh-oh
He's for the money, he's for the show
Lido's waitin' for the go
Lido, whoa-oh-oh-oh...



Baby's into runnin' around, hangin' with the crowd
Puttin' your business in the street, talkin' out loud
Sayin' you bought her this and that and how much you done spent
I swear she must believe it's all heaven sent

Hey, boy, you better bring the chick around
To the sad, sad truth, the dirty lowdown

(Oohooohooohooo
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who) Taught her how to talk like that
(Oohooohooohooo
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who) Gave her that big idea

Nothin' you can't handle, nothin' you ain't got
Put your money on the table and drive it off the lot
Turn on that old lovelight and turn a "Maybe" to a "Yes"
Same old schoolboy game got you into this mess

Hey son, better get back on to town
Face the sad old truth, the dirty lowdown

(Oohooohooohooo
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who) Put those ideas in your head
(Oohooohooohooo
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who)

Yeah

Come on back down, little son
Dig the low, low, low, low, lowdown!

You ain't got to be so bad, got to be so cold
This dog eat dog existence sure is getting old
Got to have a Jones for this, Jones for that
This runnin' with the Joneses, boy, just ain't where it's at, no, no

You gonna come back around
To the sad, sad truth, the dirty lowdown

(Oohooohooohooo
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who) Got you thinking like that, boy
(Oohooohooohooo
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who)

I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who
Said I wonder, wonder, wonder, I wonder who
Oh, look out for that lowdown (I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who)
That dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty lowdown

(Ooohooohooohooo)
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who
Ooohooohooohooo
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who

Got you thinkin' like that, got you thinkin' just like that
(Oohooohooohooo
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who) Lookin' that girl in the face is so sad
I'm ashamed of you

I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who



Moving on down the Tarkio Road
Headed up to Crete, Nebraska
Trying my best to set the highway on fire
But my bicycle won't go no faster
Tarkio Road is a mother
It's just like, oh, so many others
Well, the children reject you
And the police inspect you

Looking inside the trunk
Under the hood, hoping to find
The secret places where you
Always keep your mind
Whoa, whoa, no, Tarkio Road

Having a room or lying in jail
Learning 'bout the
Price of being free
Trying to live a constitutional life
But being held back by hypocrisy

Carry the load, my brother
You're jost like, oh, so many others
Ooh, the children reject it
And the police inspect it

You're tied to the chair
Better cool it, bound and gagged
Is that the ways on the American flag
Whoa, whoa, no, carry the load

I'm singing Tarkio, Tarkio Road
Tarkio, Tarkio Road
Tarkio, Tarkio Road
Tarkio, Tarkio Road
If you're looking for some trouble
You can find it on the Tarkio Road

Twenty-four hours above our fence
Fifty-five years of pollution
Everyone knows how the puzzle was laid
But can anyone recall the solution

Tarkio Road is a mother
It's just like, oh, so many others
Well, the people infect you
Well, they never elect you

No reason to cause that you
May have perfectly sound
The blind looker's gonna
Try to put it down
Woah, whoa, no, Tarkio Road

I'm singing again
Tarkio, Tarkio Road
Tarkio, Tarkio Road
Tarkio, Tarkio Road
Tarkio, Tarkio Road
If you're looking for some trouble
You can find it on the Tarkio Road



[Verse 1]
Standin' in line marking time
Waiting for the welfare dime
Cause they can't buy a job
The man in the silk suit hurries by
As he catches the poor old lady's eyes
Just for fun he says, "Get a job"

[Chorus]
That's just the way it is
Some things'll never change
That's just the way it is
Ha, but don't you believe them

[Verse 2]
Said, "Hey little boy, you can't go where the others go
Cause you don't look like they do"
Said, "Hey old man, how can you stand to think that way?
Did you really think about it before you made the rules?"
He said, "Son, ...

[Chorus]
That's just the way it is
Some things'll never change
That's just the way it is
Ha, but don't you believe them

That's just the way it is
That's just the way it is

[Verse 3]
Well, they passed a law in '64
To give those who ain't got, a little more
But it only goes so far
Cause the law don't change another's mind
When all it sees at the hiring time
Is the line on the color bar
But who knows

[Modified Chorus]
That's just the way it is
Some things'll never change
That's just the way it is
That's just the way it is, it is, it is, it is



[Verse 1]
Well they blew up the chicken man in Philly last night
Now they blew up his house too
Down on the boardwalk they're gettin' ready for a fight
Gonna see what them racket boys can do

Now there's trouble busin' in from outta state
And the D.A. can't get no relief
Gonna be a rumble out on the promenade
And the gamblin' commission's hangin' on by the skin of its teeth

[Chorus]
Well now everything dies baby that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back
Put your makeup on, fix your hair up pretty
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City

[Verse 2]
Well I got a job and tried to put my money away
But I got debts that no honest man can pay
So I drew what I had from the Central Trust
And I bought us two tickets on that Coast City bus

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Now our luck may have died and our love may be cold but
With you forever I'll stay
We're goin' out where the sand's turnin' to gold

So put on your stockings baby
Cause the night's getting cold
And everything dies baby that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back

[Verse 3]
Now I been lookin' for a job but it's hard to find
Down here it's just winners and losers
And don't get caught on the wrong side of that line
Well I'm tired of comin' out on the losin' end
So honey last night I met this guy and I'm gonna do a little favor for him

[Chorus]



[Verse 1]
One soft infested summer
Me and Terry became friends
Trying in vain to breathe
The fire we were born in
Catching rides to the outskirts
Tying faith between our teeth
Sleeping in that old abandoned beach house
Getting wasted in the heat
And hiding on the backstreets
Hiding on the backstreets
With a love so hard and filled with defeat
Running for our lives at night on them backstreets

[Verse 2]
Slow dancing in the dark
On the beach at Stockton's Wing
Where desperate lovers park
We sat with the last of the Duke Street Kings
Huddled in our cars
Waiting for the bells that ring
In the deep heart of the night
We let lose of everything
To go running on the backstreets
Running on the backstreets
Terry you swore we'd live forever
Taking it on them backstreets together

[Bridge]
Endless juke joints and Valentino drag
Where famous dancers scraped the tears
Up off the street dressed down in rags
Running into the darkness
Some hurt bad some really dying
At night sometimes it seemed
You could hear the whole damn city crying
Blame it on the lies that killed us
Blame it on the truth that ran us down
You can blame it all on me Terry
It don't matter to me now
When the breakdown hit at midnight
There was nothing left to say
But I hated him
And I hated you when you went away

[Verse 3]
Laying here in the dark
You're like an angel on my chest
Just another tramp of hearts
Crying tears of faithlessness
Remember all the movies, Terry
We'd go see
Trying to learn to walk like the heroes
We thought we had to be
Well after all this time
To find we're just like all the rest
Stranded in the park
And forced to confess
To hiding on the backstreets
Hiding on the backstreets
Where we swore forever friends
On the backstreets until the end

[Outro]
Hiding on the backstreets
Hiding on the backstreets



[Verse 1]
Lights out tonight
Trouble in the heartland
Got a head-on collision
Smashin' in my guts, man
I'm caught in a cross fire
That I don't understand
But there's one thing I know for sure girl
I don't give a damn
For the same old played out scenes
I don't give a damn
For just the in betweens
Honey, I want the heart, I want the soul
I want control right now
Talk about a dream
Try to make it real
You wake up in the night
With a fear so real
Spend your life waiting
For a moment that just don't come
Well, don't waste your time waiting

[Chorus]
Badlands, you gotta live it everyday
Let the broken hearts stand
As the price you've gotta pay
We'll keep pushin' till it's understood
And these badlands start treating us good

[Verse 2]
Workin' in the fields
Till you get your back burned
Workin' 'neath the wheel
Till you get your facts learned
Baby I got my facts
Learned real good right now
You better get it straight darling
Poor man wanna be rich
Rich man wanna be king
And a king ain't satisfied
Till he rules everything
I wanna go out tonight
I wanna find out what I got
Well I believe in the love that you gave me

I believe in the love that you gave me
I believe in the faith that could save me
I believe in the hope
And I pray that some day
It may raise me above these

[Chorus]
Badlands, you gotta live it everyday
Let the broken hearts stand
As the price you've gotta pay
We'll keep pushin' till it's understood
And these badlands start treating us good

[Verse 3]
For the ones who had a notion
A notion deep inside
That it ain't no sin
To be glad you're alive
I wanna find one face
That ain't looking through me
I wanna find one place
I wanna spit in the face of these badlands

[Chorus]
Badlands, you gotta live it everyday
Let the broken hearts stand
As the price you've gotta pay
We'll keep pushin' till it's understood
And these badlands start treating us good



Madman drummers bummers and Indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat
In the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat
With a boulder on my shoulder feelin' kinda older I tripped the
Merry-go-round
With this very unpleasing sneezing and wheezing the calliope
Crashed to the ground

Some all-hot half-shot was headin' for the hot spot snappin' his fingers clappin' his hands
And some fleshpot mascot was tied into a lover's knot with a whatnot in her hand
And now young Scott with a slingshot finally found a tender spot and throws his lover in the sand
And some bloodshot forget-me-not whispers daddy's within earshot save the buckshot turn up the band

And she was blinded by the light
Cut loose like a deuce another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
She got down but she never got tight, but she'll make it alright

Some brimstone baritone anti-cyclone rolling stone preacher from the east
He says: "Dethrone the dictaphone, hit it in its funny bone, that's where they expect it least"
And some new-mown chaperone was standin' in the corner all alone watchin' the young girls dance
And some fresh-sown moonstone was messin' with his frozen zone to remind him of the feeling of romance

Yeah he was blinded by the light
Cut loose like a deuce another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
He got down but she never got tight, but he's gonna make it tonight

Some silicone sister with her manager's mister told me I got what it takes
She said I'll turn you on sonny, to something strong if you play that song with the funky break
And go-cart Mozart was checkin' out the weather chart to see if it was safe to go outside
And little Early-Pearly came in by her curly-wurly and asked me if I needed a ride

Oh, some hazard from Harvard was skunked on beer playin' backyard bombardier
Yes and Scotland Yard was trying hard, they sent a dude with a calling card
He said, do what you like, but don't do it here
Well I jumped up, turned around, spit in the air, fell on the ground
Asked him which was the way back home
He said take a right at the light, keep goin' straight until night, and then boy, you're on your own

And now in Zanzibar a shootin' star was ridin' in a side car hummin' a lunar tune
Yes, and the avatar said blow the bar but first remove the cookie jar we're gonna teach those boys to laugh too soon
And some kidnapped handicap was complainin' that he caught the clap from some mousetrap he bought last night
Well I unsnapped his skull cap and between his ears I saw
A gap but figured he'd be all right

He was just blinded by the light
Cut loose like a deuce another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Mama always told me not to look into the sights of the sun
Oh but mama that's
Where the fun is
   



[Verse 1]
Born down in a dead man's town
The first kick I took was when I hit the ground
You end up like a dog that's been beat too much
Till you spend half your life just covering up

[Chorus]
Born in the U.S.A
I was born in the U.S.A
I was born in the U.S.A
Born in the U.S.A

[Verse 2]
Got in a little hometown jam
So they put a rifle in my hand
Sent me off to a foreign land
To go and kill the yellow man

[Chorus]
Born in the U.S.A
I was born in the U.S.A
I was born in the U.S.A
I was born in the U.S.A
Born in the U.S.A

[Verse 3]
Come back home to the refinery
Hiring man says "Son if it was up to me"
Went down to see my V.A. man
He said "Son, don't you understand"

[Verse 4]
I had a brother at Khe Sanh fighting off the Viet Cong
They're still there, he's all gone
He had a woman he loved in Saigon
I got a picture of him in her arms now

[Verse 5]
Down in the shadow of the penitentiary
Out by the gas fires of the refinery
I'm ten years burning down the road
Nowhere to run ain't got nowhere to go

[Chorus]
Born in the U.S.A
I was born in the U.S.A
Born in the U.S.A
I'm a long gone Daddy in the U.S.A
Born in the U.S.A
Born in the U.S.A
Born in the U.S.A
I'm a cool rocking Daddy in the U.S.A



In the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American dream
At night we ride through mansions of glory in suicide machines
Sprung from cages out on Highway 9
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected and steppin' out over the line
Oh, baby this town rips the bones from your back
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap
We gotta get out while we're young
`Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run

Wendy let me in, I wanna be your friend
I want to guard your dreams and visions
Just wrap your legs round these velvet rims
And strap your hands across my engines
Together we could break this trap
We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back
Oh, will you walk with me out on the wire?
`Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider
But I gotta find out how it feels
I want to know if love is wild, babe, I want to know if love is real
Oh can you show me?

Beyond the palace hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard
The girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors
And the boys try to look so hard
The amusement park rises bold and stark
Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist
I wanna die with you, Wendy, on the streets tonight
In an everlasting kiss

(1, 2, 3, 4) The highways jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive
Everybody's out on the run tonight but there's no place left to hide
Together, Wendy, we can live with the sadness
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul
Oh, someday girl, I don't know when, we're gonna get to that place
Where we really want to go and we'll walk in the sun
But till then tramps like us - baby we were born to run
Oh honey, tramps like us, baby we were born to run
Tramps like us, baby we were born to run



[Verse 1]
The times are tough now, just getting tougher
This old world is rough, it's just getting rougher
Cover me, come on baby, cover me

[Chorus 1]
Well I'm looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me

[Verse 2]
Promise me baby you won't let them find us
Hold me in your arms, let's let our love blind us
Cover me, shut the door and cover me

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
Outside's the rain, the driving snow
I can hear the wild wind blowing
Turn out the light, bolt the door
I ain't going out there no more

[Verse 3]
This whole world is out there just trying to score
I've seen enough; I don't want to see any more
Cover me, come on and cover me

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]
Well I'm looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me [x3]

[Outro]
Come on baby [x3]



I get up in the evening
And I ain't got nothing to say
I come home in the morning
I go to bed feeling the same way
I ain't nothing but tired
Man, I'm just tired and bored with myself
Hey there baby, I could use just a little help

You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

Message keeps getting clearer
Radio's on and I'm moving 'round the place
I check my look in the mirror
I wanna change my clothes, my hair, my face
Man, I ain't getting nowhere
I'm just living in a dump like this
There's something happening somewhere
Baby I just know that there is

You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

You sit around getting older
There's a joke here somewhere and it's on me
I'll shake this world off my shoulders
Come on, baby, the laugh's on me

Stay on the streets of this town
And they'll be carving you up all right
They say you gotta stay hungry
Hey, baby, I'm just about starving tonight
I'm dying for some action
I'm sick of sitting 'round here trying to write this book
I need a love reaction
Come on now, baby, gimme just one look

You can't start a fire
Sitting 'round crying over a broken heart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
You can't start a fire
Worrying about your little world falling apart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Hey, baby



Yeah
Uh
Wooh
Huh

[Verse 1]
I had a friend was a big baseball player
Back in high school
He could throw that speedball by you
Make you look like a fool boy
Saw him the other night at this roadside bar
I was walking in, he was walking out
We went back inside sat down had a few drinks
But all he kept talking about was

[Chorus]
Glory days, well they'll pass you by
Glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory days, glory days

[Verse 2]
Well there's a girl that lives up the block
Back in school she could turn all the boy's heads
Sometimes on a Friday I'll stop by
And have a few drinks after she put her kids to bed
Her and her husband Bobby well they split up
I guess it's two years gone by now
We just sit around talking about the old times
She says when she feels like crying
She starts laughing thinking bout

[Chorus]
Glory days, well they'll pass you by
Glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory days, glory days

[Missing Verse]
My old man worked 20 years on the line
And they let him go
Now everywhere he goes out looking for work
They just tell him that he's too old
I was 9 nine years old and he was working at the
Metuchen Ford plant assembly line
Now he just sits on a stool down at the Legion hall
But I can tell what's on his mind

[Missing Chorus]
Glory days yeah goin back
Glory days aw he ain't never had
Glory days, glory days

[Verse 3]
In fact I think I'm going down to the well tonight
And I'm gonna drink till I get my fill
And I hope when I get old I don't sit around thinking about it
But I probably will
Yeah, just sitting back trying to recapture
A little of the glory yeah
Well time slips away and leaves you with nothing, mister, but
Boring stories of

[Chorus]
Glory days, well they'll pass you by
Glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory days, glory days



[Verse 1]
I stood stone-like at midnight
Suspended in my masquerade
I combed my hair till it was just right
And commanded the night brigade
I was open to pain and crossed by the rain
And I walked on a crooked crutch
I strolled all alone through a fallout zone
And came out with my soul untouched
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd
But when they said, "Sit down," I stood up

Ooh... growin' up

[Verse 2]
The flag of piracy flew from my mast
My sails were set wing to wing
I had a jukebox graduate for first mate
She couldn't sail but she sure could sing
I pushed B-52 and bombed them with the blues
With my gear set stubborn on standing
I broke all the rules
Strafed my old high school
Never once gave thought to landing
I hid in the clouded warmth of the crowd
But when they said
"Come down," I threw up

Ooh... growin' up

[Verse 3]
I took month-long vacations in the stratosphere
And you know it's really hard to hold your breath
I swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared
I was the cosmic kid in full costume dress
Well, my feet they finally took root in the earth
But I got me a nice little place in the stars
And I swear I found the key to the universe
In the engine of an old parked car
I hid in the mother breast of the crowd
But when they said, "Pull down," I pulled up

Ooh... growin' up
Ooh... growin' up



[Verse 1]
Got a wife and kids in Baltimore, Jack
I went out for a ride and I never went back
Like a river that don't know where it's flowing
I took a wrong turn and I just kept going

[Chorus]
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Lay down your money and you play your part
Everybody's got a hungry heart

[Verse 2]
I met her in a Kingstown bar
We fell in love I knew it had to end
We took what we had and we ripped it apart
Now here I am down in Kingstown again

[Chorus]
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Lay down your money and you play your part
Everybody's got a hungry heart

[Verse 3]
Everybody needs a place to rest
Everybody wants to have a home
Don't make no difference what nobody says
Ain't nobody like to be alone

[Chorus]
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Lay down your money and you play your part
Everybody's got a hungry heart



Hey little girl, is your daddy home?
Did he go away and leave you all alone?
I got a bad desire
Oh, oh, oh
I'm on fire

Tell me now baby, is he good to you?
Can he do to you the things that I do?
Oh no, I can take you higher
Oh, oh, oh
I'm on fire

Sometimes it's like someone took a knife, baby, edgy and dull
And cut a six-inch valley through the middle of my soul
At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet
And a freight train running through the middle of my head
Only you can cool my desire
Oh, oh, oh
I'm on fire
Oh, oh, oh
I'm on fire
Oh, oh, oh
I'm on fire



[Verse]
I had skin like leather and the diamond-hard look of a cobra
I was born blue and weathered but I burst just like a supernova
I could walk like Brando right into the sun
Then dance just like a Casanova
With my blackjack and jacket and hair slicked sweet
Silver star studs on my duds like a Harley in heat
When I strut down the street I could feel its heartbeat
The sisters fell back and said "Don't that man look pretty"
The cripple on the corner cried out "Nickels for your pity"
Them gasoline boys downtown sure talk gritty
It's so hard to be a saint in the city
I was the king of the alley, mama, I could talk some trash
I was the prince of the paupers crowned downtown at the beggar's bash
I was the pimp's main prophet I kept everything cool
Just a backstreet gambler with the luck to lose
And when the heat came down it was left on the ground
The devil appeared like Jesus through the steam in the street
Showin' me a hand I knew even the cops couldn't beat
I felt his hot breath on my neck as I dove into the heat
It's so hard to be a saint when you're just a boy out on the street
And the sages of the subway sit just like the living dead
As the tracks clack out the rhythm their eyes fixed straight ahead
They ride the line of balance and hold on by just a thread
But it's too hot in these tunnels you can get hit up by the heat
You get up to get out at your next stop but they push you back down in your seat
Your heart starts beatin' faster as you struggle to your feet
Then you're outa that hole and back up on the street
And them South Side sisters sure look pretty
The cripple on the corner cries out "Nickels for your pity"
And them downtown boys they sure talk gritty
It's so hard to be a saint in the city



I got no time for the corner boys
Down in the street making all that noise
Or the girls down on the avenue
Cause tonight I wanna be with you

Tonight I'm gonna take that ride
Across the river to the Jersey side
Take my baby to the carnival
And I'll take her on all the rides

Cause down the shore everything's all right
You and your baby on a Saturday night
Well, you know all my dreams come true
When I'm walking down the street with you

Sing sha la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la
Sha la la la I'm in love with a Jersey girl

Sha la la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la

You know she thrills me with all her charms
When I'm wrapped up in my baby's arms
My little girl gives me everything
I know that some day that she'll wear my ring

So don't bother me, man, I ain't got no time
I'm on my way to see that girl of mine
Cause nothing matters in this whole wide world
When you're in love with a Jersey girl

Sha la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la
Sha la la la I'm in love with a Jersey girl

Sha la la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la

I see you on the street and you look so tired
I know that job you got leaves you so uninspired
When I come by to take you out to eat
You're lyin' all dressed up on the bed, baby, fast asleep

Go in the bathroom and put your makeup on
We're gonna take that little girl of yours
And drop her off at your mom's
I know a place where the dancin's free
Now baby won't you come with me

Cause down the shore everything's all right
You and your baby on a Saturday night
Nothing matters in this whole wide world
When you're in love with a Jersey girl

Sha la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la
Sha la la la I'm in love with a Jersey girl

Sha la la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la



[Intro]

The Rangers had a homecoming in Harlem late last night
And the Magic Rat drove his sleek machine
Over the Jersey state line
Barefoot girl sitting on the hood of a Dodge
Drinking warm beer in the soft summer rain
The Rat pulls into town rolls up his pants
Together they take a stab at romance
And disappear down Flamingo Lane

Well the maximum lawman run down Flamingo
Chasing the Rat and the barefoot girl
And the kids round here look just like shadows
Always quiet, holding hands
From the churches to the jails
Tonight all is silence in the world
As we take our stand down in jungleland

Well the midnight gangs assembled
And picked a rendezvous for the night
They'll meet 'neath that giant Exxon sign
That brings this fair city light
Man there's an opera out on the turnpike
There's a ballet being fought out in the alley
Until the local cops, cherry tops, rips this holy night,
The street's alive as secret debts are paid
Contact's made, they vanished unseen
Kids flash guitars just like switch-blades
Hustling for the record machine
The hungry and the hunted
Explode into rock'n'roll bands
That face off against each other out in the street
Down in jungleland

In the parking lot the visionaries dress in the latest rage
Inside the backstreet girls are dancing to the records that the DJ plays
Lonely-hearted lovers struggle in dark corners
Desperate as the night moves on
Just one look and a whisper, and they're gone

[Saxophone solo]

Beneath the city two hearts beat
Soul engines running through a night so tender
In a bedroom locked in whispers
Of soft refusal and then surrender
In the tunnels uptown the Rat's own dream guns him down
As shots echo down them hallways in the night
No one watches when the ambulance pulls away
Or as the girl shuts out the bedroom light

Outside the street's on fire in a real death waltz
Between what's flesh and what's fantasy
And the poets down here
Don't write nothing at all
They just stand back and let it all be
And in the quick of the night they reach for their moment
And try to make an honest stand
But they wind up wounded, not even dead
Tonight in jungleland



[Verse 1]
You may think I'm foolish
For the foolish things I do
You may wonder how come I love you
When you get on my nerves like you do
Well baby you know you bug me
There ain't no secret 'bout that
Well come on over here and hug me
Baby I'll spill the facts
Well honey it ain't your money
Cause baby I got plenty of that
I love you for your...

[Chorus]
Pink Cadillac
Crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back
Oozing down the street
Waving to the girls
Feeling out of sight
Spending all my money
On a Saturday night
Honey I just wonder what you do there in back
Of your pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac

[Verse 2]
Well now way back in the Bible
Temptations always come along
There's always somebody tempting
Somebody into doing something they know is wrong
Well they tempt you, man, with silver
And they tempt you, sir, with gold
And they tempt you with the pleasures
That the flesh does surely hold
They say Eve tempted Adam with an apple
But man I ain't going for that
I know it was her...

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Now some folks say it's too big
And uses too much gas
Some folks say it's too old
And that it goes too fast
But my love is bigger than a Honda
It's bigger than a Subaru
Hey man there's only one thing
And one car that will do
Anyway we don't have to drive it
Honey we can park it out in back
And have a party in your...

[Chorus]



[Verse 1]
I've been working real hard, trying to get my hands clean
Tonight we'll drive that dusty road from Monroe to Angeline
To buy you a gold ring and pretty dress of blue
Baby just one kiss will get these things for you
A kiss to seal our fate tonight
A kiss to prove it all night

[Chorus]
Prove it all night
Girl there's nothing else that we can do
So prove it all night, prove it all night
And girl I'll prove it all night for you

[Verse 2]
Everybody's got a hunger, a hunger they can't resist
There's so much that you want, you deserve much more than this
But if dreams came true, oh, wouldn't that be nice
But this ain't no dream we're living through tonight
Girl, you want it, you take it, you pay the price

[Chorus]
Prove it all night, prove it all night girl and call the bluff
Prove it all night, prove it all night and girl
I prove it all night for your love

[Verse 3]
Baby, tie your hair back in a long white bow
Meet me in the fields out behind the dynamo
You hear the voices telling you not to go
They made their choices and they'll never know
What it means to steal, to cheat, to lie
What it's like to live and die

[Chorus]

[Outro]
To prove it all night



I got a sixty-nine Chevy with a 396
Fuelie heads and a Hurst on the floor
She’s waiting tonight down in the parking lot
Outside the Seven-Eleven store
Me and my partner Sonny built her straight out of scratch
And he rides with me from town to town
We only run for the money got no strings attached
We shut ’em up and then we shut ’em down

Tonight tonight the strip’s just right
I wanna blow 'em off in my first heat
Summer’s here and the time is right
For racin’ in the street

We take all the action we can meet
And we cover all the northeast states
When the strip shuts down we run ’em in the street
From the fire roads to the interstate
Some guys they just give up living
And start dying little by little piece by piece
Some guys come home from work and wash up
Then go racin’ in the street

Tonight tonight the strip’s just right
I wanna blow ’em all out of their seats
We're calling out around the world
We’re going racin’ in the street

I met her on the strip three years ago
In a Camaro with this dude from L.A
I blew that Camaro off my back and drove that little girl away
But now there’s wrinkles around my baby’s eyes
And she cries herself to sleep at night
When I come home the house is dark
She sighs “Baby did you make it all right”
She sits on the porch of her daddy’s house
But all her pretty dreams are torn
She stares off alone into the night
With the eyes of one who hates for just being born

For all the shut-down strangers and hot rod angels
Rumbling through this promised land
Tonight my baby and me we’re gonna ride to the sea
And wash these sins off our hands

Tonight tonight the highway’s bright
Out of our way mister you best keep
Cause summer’s here and the time is right
We’re goin’ racin’ in the street



Spread out now, Rosie, doctor come cut loose her mama's reins
You know playin' blind man's bluff is a little baby's game
You pick up Little Dynamite, I'm gonna pick up Little Gun
And together we're gonna go out tonight and make that highway run
You don't have to call me lieutenant, Rosie, and I don't want to be your son
The only lover I'm ever gonna need's your soft sweet little girl's tongue
Ah, Rosie, you're the one

Dynamite's in the belfry, baby, playin' with the bats
Little Gun's downtown in front of Woolworth's, tryin' out his attitude on all the cats
Papa's on the corner, waitin' for the bus
Mama, she's home in the window, waitin' up for us
She'll be there in that chair when they wrestle her upstairs, cause you know we ain't gonna come
Ah, I ain't here on business, baby, I'm only here for fun
And Rosie, you're the one

[Chorus]
Rosalita, jump a little lighter
Señorita, come sit by my fire
I just want to be your lover, ain't no liar
Rosalita, you're my stone desire

Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knees Willie, don't you know they're gonna be there
Ah, Sloppy Sue and Big Bones Billy, they'll be comin' up for air
We're gonna play some pool, skip some school, act real cool
Stay out all night, it's gonna feel all right
So Rosie, come out tonight, oh, baby, come out tonight
Windows are for cheaters, chimneys for the poor
Oh, closets are for hangers, winners use the door
So use it Rosie, that's what it's there for

[Chorus]

All right

Now, I know your mama, she don't like me cause I play in a rock and roll band
And I know your daddy, he don't dig me, but he never did understand
Your papa lowered the boom, he locked you in your room
I'm coming to lend a hand
I'm coming to liberate you, confiscate you, I want to be your man
Someday we'll look back on this and it will all seem funny
But now you're sad, your mama's mad
And your papa says he knows that I don't (have any money)
Whoa, your papa says he knows (that I don't have any money)
Whoa, so your daddy says he knows I don't have (Papa says he knows that I don't have any money)

Well, tell him this is his last chance to get his daughter in a fine romance
Because the record company, Rosie, just gave me a big advance
And my tires were slashed and I almost crashed, but the Lord had mercy
And my machine, she's a dud, I'm stuck in the mud somewhere in the swamps of Jersey
Well, hold on tight, stay up all night, cause Rosie, I'm comin' on strong
By the time we meet the morning light, I will hold you in my arms
I know a pretty little place in Southern California down San Diego way
There's a little café where they play guitars all night and all day
You can hear 'em in the back room strummin'
So hold tight, baby, cause don't you know daddy's comin'
Oh, everybody, so!

[Chorus]

Oh, yeah



[Verse 1]
With her killer graces
And her secret places
That no boy can fill
With her hands on her hips
Oh and that smile on her lips
Because she knows that it kills me
With her soft French cream
Standing in that doorway like a dream
I wish she'd just leave me alone
Because French cream won't soften them boots
And French kisses will not break that heart of stone
With her long hair falling
And her eyes that shine like a midnight sun
Oh she's the one
She's the one

[Verse 2]
That thunder in your heart
At night when you're kneeling in the dark
It says you're never gonna leave her
But there's this angel in her eyes
That tells such desperate lies
And all you want to do is believe her
And tonight you'll try
Just one more time
To leave it all behind
And to break on through
Oh she can take you
But if she wants to break you
She's gonna find out that ain't so easy to do
And no matter where you sleep
Tonight or how far you run
Oh she's the one
She's the one

[Bridge]
Oh and just one kiss
She'd fill them long summer nights
With her tenderness
That secret pact you made
Back when her love could save you
From the bitterness
Oh she's the one
Oh she's the one
Oh she's the one
Oh she's the one



[Verse]
Crazy Janey and her mission man were back in the alley tradin' hands
'long came Wild Billy with his friend G-man all duded up for Saturday night
Well Billy slammed on his coaster brakes and said anybody wanna go on up to Greasy Lake
It's about a mile down on the dark side of route eighty-eight
I got a bottle of rose so let's try it
We'll pick up Hazy Davy and Killer Joe and I'll take you all out to where the gypsy angels go
They're built like light
And they dance like spirits in the night (all night) in the night (all night)
Oh, you don't know what they can do to you
Spirits in the night (all night), in the night (all night)
Stand right up now and let it shoot through you
Well now Wild young Billy was a crazy cat and he shook some dust out of his coonskin cap
He said, "Trust some of this it'll show you where you're at, or at least it'll help you really feel it"
By the time we made it up to Greasy Lake I had my head out the window and Janey's fingers were in the cake
I think I really dug her cause I was too loose to fake
I said, "I'm hurt." She said, "Honey let me heal it"
And we danced all night to a soul fairy band
And she kissed me just right like only a lonely angel can
She felt so nice, just as soft as a spirit in the night (all night)
In the night (all night). Janey don't know what she do to you
Like a spirit in the night (all night), in the night (all night)
Stand right up and let her shoot through me
Now the night was bright and the stars threw light on Billy and Davy
Dancin' in the moonlight
They were down near the water in a stone mud fight
Killer Joe gone passed out on the lawn
Well now Hazy Davy got really hurt, he ran into the lake in just his socks and a shirt
Me and Crazy Janey was makin' love in the dirt singin' our birthday songs
Janey said it was time to go
So we closed our eyes and said goodbye to gypsy angel row, felt so right
Together we moved like spirits in the night, all night
Baby don't know what they can do to you
Spirits in the night, all night
Stand right up and let it shoot right through you



[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Tear drops on the city
Bad Scooter searching for his groove
Seem like the whole world walking pretty
And you can't find the room to move
Well everybody better move over, that's all
I'm running on the bad side
And I got my back to the wall
Tenth Avenue freeze-out, Tenth Avenue freeze-out

[Verse 2]
I'm stranded in the jungle
Taking all the heat they was giving
The night is dark but the sidewalks bright
And lined with the light of the living
From a tenement window a transistor blasts
Turn around the corner things got real quiet real fast
I walked into a Tenth Avenue freeze-out
Tenth Avenue freeze-out

[Bridge]
And I'm all alone, I'm all alone
And kid you better get the picture
And I'm on my own, I'm on my own
And I can't go home

[Verse 3]
When the change was made uptown
And the Big Man joined the band
From the coastline to the city
All the little pretties raise their hands
I'm gonna sit back right easy and laugh
When Scooter and the Big Man bust this city in half
With a Tenth Avenue freeze-out, tenth avenue freeze-out
Tenth avenue freeze-out



The screen door slams
Mary's dress waves
Like a vision she dances across the porch
As the radio plays
Roy Orbison singing for the lonely
Hey that's me and I want you only
Don't turn me home again
I just can't face myself alone again
Don't run back inside
Darling you know just what I'm here for
So you're scared and you're thinking
That maybe we ain't that young anymore
Show a little faith there's magic in the night
You ain't a beauty but hey you're alright
Oh and that's alright with me

You can hide 'neath your covers
And study your pain
Make crosses from your lovers
Throw roses in the rain
Waste your summer praying in vain
For a saviour to rise from these streets
Well now I'm no hero
That's understood
All the redemption I can offer girl
Is beneath this dirty hood
With a chance to make it good somehow
Hey what else can we do now?
Except roll down the window
And let the wind blow
Back your hair
Well the night's busting open
These two lanes will take us anywhere
We got one last chance to make it real
To trade in these wings on some wheels
Climb in back
Heaven's waiting on down the tracks
Oh-oh come take my hand
We're riding out tonight to case the promised land
Oh-oh Thunder Road oh Thunder Road
Lying out there like a killer in the sun
Hey I know it's late we can make it if we run
Oh Thunder Road sit tight take hold
Thunder Road

Well I got this guitar
And I learned how to make it talk
And my car's out back
If you're ready to take that long walk
From your front porch to my front seat
The door's open but the ride it ain't free
And I know you're lonely
For words that I ain't spoken
But tonight we'll be free
All the promises'll be broken
There were ghosts in the eyes
Of all the boys you sent away
They haunt this dusty beach road
In the skeleton frames of burned out Chevrolets
They scream your name at night in the street
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet
And in the lonely cool before dawn
You hear their engines roaring on
But when you get to the porch they're gone
On the wind so Mary climb in
It's a town full of losers
And I'm pulling out of here to win



Drivin' home this evening
I coulda sworn we had it all worked out
You had this boy believin'
Way beyond the shadow of a doubt, yeah

Well I heard it on the street
I heard you might found somebody new yeah
Well who is he baby who is he
And tell me what he means to you oh yeah

I took it all for granted
But how was I to know
That you'd be letting go

Now it cuts like a knife
But it feels so right
Yeah! It cuts like a knife
Oh, but it feels so right

There's times I've been mistaken
There's times I thought I'd been misunderstood - ooh yeah
So wait a minute darlin'
Can't you see we did the best we could ooh we could

This wouldn't be the first time
Things have gone astray
Now you've thrown it all away

Now it cuts like a knife yeah
But It feels so right
Oh! It cuts like a knife
Yeah! But it feels so right

Oh! It cuts like a knife!
But if feels so right baby!
Oh! It cuts like a knife!
Yeeah! Hey!

But how was I to know
That you'd be letting go

Now it cuts like a knife yeah
But It feels so right
Oh. Now it cuts like a knife
Yeah But it feels so right Yeeah!

Oh, it cuts like a knife
Ooh yeah yeah
But it feels so right baby

Now it cuts like knife now

But it feels so right, yeah yeah
Feels so right baby
Na na yeah, it feels so right
And it cuts like a knife
Yeah yeah
Feels so right baby



Oh, thinkin' about our younger years
There was only you and me
We were young and wild and free

Now nothin' can take you away from me
We've been down that road before
But that's over now
You keep me comin' back for more

Baby, you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe
We're in Heaven

And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in Heaven

Oh, once in your life you find someone
Who will turn your world around
Bring you up when you're feelin' down

Yeah, nothin' could change what you mean to me
Oh, there's lots that I could say
But just hold me now
Cause our love will light the way

And baby you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms
I'm finding it hard to believe
We're in Heaven

Yeah, love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in Heaven, yeah

I've been waitin' for so long
For somethin' to arrive
For love to come along

Now our dreams are comin' true
Through the good times and the bad
Yeah, I'll be standin' there by you

And baby you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe
We're in Heaven

And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in Heaven, Heaven, woah

You're all that I want
You're all that I need



She says her love for me could never die
But that'd change if she ever found out about you and I

Oh, but her love is cold
Wouldn't hurt her if she didn't know, cause
When it gets too much
I need to feel your touch

I'm gonna run to you
I'm gonna run to you
Cause when the feeling's right I'm gonna run all night
I'm gonna run to you

She's got a heart of gold, she'd never let me down
But you're the one that always turns me on, you keep me comin' 'round

I know her love is true
But it's so damn easy makin' love to you
I got my mind made up
I need to feel your touch

I'm gonna run to you
Yeah, I'm gonna run to you
Cause when the feeling's right I'm gonna stay all night
I'm gonna run to you

Yeah, I'm gonna run to you
Oh, when the feeling's right I'm gonna run all night
I'm gonna run to you

Oh, I'm gonna run to you
Yeah, I'm gonna run to you
Cause when the feeling's right I'm gonna stay all night
I'm gonna run to you

Oh, I'm gonna run to you
Yeah, when the feeling's right I'm gonna stay all night
Oh, when the feeling's right now
Oh, yeah, when the feeling's right now

I'm gonna run to you
Oh, oh

Yeah, I'm gonna run to you
Yeah, now
Oh, I'm gonna run to you, run to you
Yeah, I'm gonna run to you



I've been lookin' for someone
Between the fire and the flame
We're all lookin' for somethin'
To ease the pain

Now who can you turn to
When it's all black and white
And the winners are losers
You see it every night

I need somebody
Somebody like you
Everybody needs somebody

I need somebody
Hey what about you
Everybody needs somebody

When you're out on the front line
And you're watchin' them fall
It doesn't take long to realize
It ain't worth fightin' for

I thought I saw the Madonna
When you walked in the room
Well your eyes were like diamonds
And they cut right through - oh they cut right through

I need somebody
Somebody like you
Everybody needs somebody - oh yeah

I need somebody
Hey what about you
We all need somebody

Yeah - Another night another lesson learned
It's the distance keeps us sane
But when the silence leads to sorrow
We do it all again - all again

Hey - I need somebody
Somebody like you
Everybody needs somebody - oh yeah

I need somebody
Oh what about you
Everybody needs somebody

Hey - I need somebody
Somebody like you
Everybody needs somebody - I need somebody

Hey - I need somebody
Somebody like you
Everybody needs somebody



I got my first real six string
Bought it at the five and dime
Played it til my fingers bled
Was the summer of '69

Me and some guys from school
Had a band and we tried real hard
Jimmy quit and Jody got married
I shoulda known we'd never get far
But when I look back now
That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Ya, I'd always wanna be there
Those were the best days of my life

Ain't no use in complainin'
When you got a job to do
Spent my evenin's down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you, ya

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that you'd wait forever
Oh, and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life
Back in the summer of '69

Oh!

Man, we were killin' time
We were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothin' can last forever
Forever, no...

Yeah!

And now the times are changin'
Look at everything that's come and gone
Sometimes when I play that old six string
I think about ya 'n wonder what went wrong

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me it would last forever
Oh, the way you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life

Oh yeah

Back in the summer of '69
Uh-huh
It was the summer of '69
Oh yeah
Me and my baby in a 69
Oh! Oh!
It was the summer, summer, summer of 69



[Verse 1]
Oh, I had a lot to say
Was thinking on my time away
I missed you and things weren't the same

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause everything inside, it never comes out right
And when I see you cry, it makes me want to die

[Chorus]
I'm sorry I'm bad, I'm sorry you're blue
I'm sorry about all things I said to you
And I know, I can't take it back
I love how you kiss, I love all your sounds
And baby, the way you make my world go round
And I just wanted to say, I'm sorry

[Verse 2]
This time, I think I'm to blame
It's harder to get through the days
You get older and blame turns to shame

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Every single day
I think about how we came all this way
The sleepless nights and the tears you cried
It's never too late to make it right
Oh yeah, I'm sorry

[Chorus]



There's something happening here
But what it is ain't exactly clear
There's a man with a gun over there
Telling me I got to beware

I think it's time we stop
Children, what's that sound?
Everybody look - what's going down?

There's battle lines being drawn
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong
Young people speaking their minds
Getting so much resistance from behind

It's time we stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look - what's going down?

What a field day for the heat
A thousand people in the street
Singing songs and carrying signs
Mostly saying, "hooray for our side"

It's time we stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look - what's going down?

Paranoia strikes deep
Into your life it will creep
It starts when you're always afraid
Step out of line, the men come and take you away

We better stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look - what's going down?

We better stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look - what's going down?

We better stop
Now, what's that sound?
Everybody look - what's going down?

We better stop
Children, what's that sound?
Everybody look - what's going down?



[Verse 1]
Oh, hello Mr. Soul
I dropped by to pick up a reason
For the thought that I caught that my head
Is the event of the season
Why in crowds just a trace of my face
Could seem so pleasin'
I'll cop out to the change
But a stranger is putting the tease on

[Verse 2]
I was down on a frown
When the messenger brought me a letter
I was raised by the praise of a fan
Who said I upset her
Any girl in the world
Could have easily known me better
She said, "You're strange, but don't change", and I let her

[Verse 3]
In a while will the smile on my face turn to plaster?
Stick around while the clown who is sick does the trick of disaster
For the race of my head and my face is moving much faster
Is it strange I should change? I don't know, why don't you ask her?[x3]



There's a woman that you ought to know
And she's coming, singing soft and low
Singing rock and roll, she's a joy to know

'Neath the shadow of a soothing hand
I am free there, just to make my plans
Dream of faraway lands, anything close at hand

And she will follow me why, do you know
Familiar places she's been by, that I know
Could it be, she don't have to try

And tomorrow, she's a friend of mine
And the sorrow, I see her face is lined
She's no longer blind, she's just hard to find



Love and hate
Get it wrong
She cut me right back down to size
Sleep the day
Let it fade
Who was there to take your place?

No one knows
Never will
Mostly me
But mostly you

What do you say?
Do you do?
When it all comes down?

Cause I don't want to come back down
From this cloud
It's taken me all this time
To find out what I need again

I don't want to come back down
From this cloud
It's taken me all this
All this time

There is no blame
Only shame
When you beg
You just complain
The more I come
The more I try
All police are paranoid

So am I
So's the future
So are you
Be a creature

What do you say?
Do you do?
When it all comes down?

Cause I don't want to come back down
From this cloud
It's taken me all this time
To find out what I need
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I don't want to come back down
From this cloud
It's taken me all this
All this time

Shoot up
Shoot up
Shoot up
You're high

Love and hate
Get it wrong
She cut me right back down to size
Sleep the day
Let it fade
Who was there to take your place?

No one knows
Never will
Mostly me
But mostly you

What do you say?
Do you do?
When it all comes down?

Cause I don't want to come back down
From this cloud
It's taken me all this time
To find out what I need
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I don't want to come back down
From this cloud
It's taken me all this
All this time

Why did you?
Why did you?
Why did you?
Why did you?

Why did you?
Why did you?
Why did you?
Why did you?

Why did you?

Come down
I don't want to come back down
From this cloud
This cloud
This cloud
This cloud
This cloud

This cloud
This cloud
This cloud
This cloud



[Bridge]
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in

[Verse 1]
Tied to a wheel, our fingers got to feel
Bleeding through a tourniquet smile
I spin on a whim, I slide to the right
I felt you like electric light
For our love, for our fear
For our rise against the years and years and years

[Chorus]
Got a machinehead, it's better than the rest
Green to red, machinehead
Got a machinehead, it's better than the rest
Green to red

I walk from my machine
I walk from my machine

[Bridge]
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in

[Verse 2]
Deaf, dumb, dirty
Starting to deserve this
Leaning on my conscience wall
Blood is like wine, unconscious all the time
If I had it all again I'd change it all

[Chorus]
Got a machinehead, it's better than the rest
Green to red, machinehead
Got a machinehead, it's better than the rest
Green to red

I walk from my machine
I walk from my machine

[Bridge]
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe in, breathe in

[Outro]
Got a machinehead, it's better than the rest
Green to red, machinehead
Got a machinehead, it's better than the rest
Green to red
Better than the rest, better than the rest
Machinehead
I walk from my machine
I walk from my machine



Now maybe
I didn't mean to treat you bad
But I did it anyway

And then maybe
Some would say your life was sad
But you lived it anyway

And so maybe
Your friends they stand around they watch you crumble
As you falter to the ground

And then someday
Your friends they stand beside as you were flyin'
Oh, you were flyin' oh so high
But then someday people look at you
For what they call their own
They watch you suffer
Yeah they hear you calling home
And then someday we can take our time
To brush the leaves aside so you can reach us
Hey but you left me far behind

Now maybe
I didn't mean to treat you oh so bad
But I did it anyway
Now maybe
Some would say you're left with what you had
But you couldn't share the pain, no, no, no
Couldn't share the pain, they watch you suffer

Now maybe
I could have made my own mistakes
But I lived with what I've known

And then maybe
We might share in something great
Won't you look at where we've grown
Won't you look at where we've gone

And the someday comes, tomorrow holds
A sense of what I feel for you in my mind
As you trip the final line
And that cold day when you lost control
Shame you left my life so soon
You should have told me, hey
Hey but you left me far behind

Now maybe
I didn't mean to treat you oh so bad
But I did it anyway
Now maybe
Some would say you're left with what you had
But you couldn't share the pain, no, no, no

Oh, no, no
Oh, no, no, no, no, no
Oh my lord
See I know
See I know

But maybe, said maybe
I didn't mean to treat you oh so bad
But I did it anyway
Sayin' now maybe
Some would say you're left with what you had
But you couldn't share the pain
Now I've said, but times have changed
Your friends they come and watch you
Crumble to the ground
They watch you suffer
Yeah they hold you down, hold on down
Now I said maybe, maybe
I didn't mean to treat you bad
But you left me far behind
Left me far behind
Left me far behind



I'm going up the country, baby, don't you wanna go?
I'm going up the country, baby, don't you wanna go?
I'm going to some place where I've never been before

I'm going, I'm going where the water tastes like wine
I'm going where the water tastes like wine
We can jump in the water, stay drunk all the time

I'm gonna leave this city, got to get away
I'm gonna leave this city, got to get away
All this fussing and fighting, man, you know I sure can't stay

Now, baby, pack your leaving trunk, you know we've got to leave today
Just exactly where we're going I cannot say, but
We might even leave the USA
'Cause there's a brand new game that I wanna play

No use of you running or screaming and crying
'Cause you've got a home as long as I've got mine



Well, I'm so tired of crying but I'm out on the road again
I'm on the road again
Well, I'm so tired of crying but I'm out on the road again
I'm on the road again

I ain't got no woman just to call my special friend

You know the first time I traveled out in the rain and snow
In the rain and snow
You know the first time I traveled out in the rain and snow
In the rain and snow

I didn't have no payroll, not even no place to go

And my dear mother left me when I was quite young
When I was quite young
And my dear mother left me when I was quite young
When I was quite young (When I was quite young)

She said: "Lord, have mercy on my wicked son"

Take a hint from me, mama, please, don't you cry no more
Don't you cry no more
Take a hint from me, mama, please, don't you cry no more
Don't you cry no more

Cause it's soon one morning down the road I'm going

But I ain't going down that long old lonesome road
All by myself
But I ain't going down that long old lonesome road
All by myself

I can't carry you, baby, gonna carry somebody else



Stayed in bed all morning just to pass the time
There's something wrong here, there can be no denying
One of us is changing
Or maybe we just stopped trying

And it's too late, baby, now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it
Something inside has died
And I can't hide and I just can't fake it, oh no no no

It used to be so easy living here with you
You were light and breezy and I knew just what to do
Now you look so unhappy and I feel like a fool

And it's too late, baby, now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it
Something inside has died
And I can't hide and I just can't fake it

{Instrumental}

There'll be good times again for me and you
But we just can't stay together, don't you feel it, too
Still I'm glad for what we had and how I once loved you

But it's too late, baby, now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it
Something inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it
Oh no no no

It's too late, late
It's too late, now darlin
It's too late...



Oh very young
What will you leave us this time?
You're only dancing on this earth for a short while
And though your dreams may toss and turn you now
They will vanish away like your daddy's best jeans
Denim blue fading up to the sky

And though you want them to last forever
You know they never will
You know they never will
And the patches make the goodbye harder still

Oh very young
What will you leave us this time?
There'll never be a better chance to change your mind
And if you want this world to see a better day
Will you carry the words of love with you?
Will you ride the great white bird into heaven?

And though you want to last forever
You know you never will
You know you never will
And the goodbye makes the journey harder still

Will you carry the words of love with you?
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Oh very young
What will you leave us this time?
You're only dancing on this earth for a short while
Oh very young
What will you leave us this time?



[Intro]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

[Verse 1]
Now that I've lost everything to you
You say you wanna start something new
And it's breakin' my heart you're leavin', baby, I'm grievin'
But if you wanna leave, take good care
Hope you have a lot of nice things to wear
But then a lot of nice things turn bad out there

[Chorus]
Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
And I'll always remember you like a child, girl

[Verse 2]
You know I've seen a lot of what the world can do
And it's breakin' my heart in two
Because I never wanna see you sad, girl, don't be a bad girl
But if you wanna leave, take good care
Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there
But just remember there's a lot of bad and beware, beware

[Chorus]
Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
And it's hard to get by just upon a smile
Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
And I'll always remember you like a child, girl

[Bridge]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Baby, I love you
But if you wanna leave, take good care
Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there
But just remember there's a lot of bad and beware, beware

[Extended Chorus]
Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
And it's hard to get by just upon a smile
Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
And I'll always remember you like a child, girl
Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
And it's hard to get by just upon a smile
Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
And I'll always remember you like a child, girl



[Verse 1]
Well the eagle's been flying slow
And the flag's been flying low
And a lot of people saying that America's fixing to fall
Well speaking just for me
And some people from Tennessee
We've got a thing or two to tell you all
This lady may have stumbled
But she ain't never fell
And if the Russians don't believe that
They can all go straight to hell
We're gonna put her feet back
On the path of righteousness and then
God bless America again

[Chorus]
And you never did think
That it ever would happen again (In America, did you?)
You never did think
That we'd ever get together again
(We damn sure fooled you)
Yeah, we're walking real proud
And we're talking real loud again (In America)
You never did think
That it ever would happen again

[Verse 2]
From The Sound up in Long Island
Out to San Francisco Bay
And everything that's in between them is our own
And we may have done a little bit
Of fighting among ourselves
But you outside people best leave us alone
Cause we'll all stick together
And you can take that to the bank
That's the cowboys and the hippies
And the rebels and the yanks
You just go and lay your hand
On a Pittsburgh Steelers fan
And I think you're gonna finally understand

[Chorus][x2]



[Verse 1]
People say I'm no good
And crazy as a loon
'Cause I get stoned in the mornin'
I get drunk in the afternoon
Kinda like my old blue tick hound
I like to lay around in the shade
And I ain't got no money
But I damn sure got it made

[Chorus]
'Cause I ain't askin' nobody for nothin'
If I can't get it on my own
If you don't like the way I'm livin'
You just leave this long haired country boy alone

[Verse 2]
Preacher man talkin' on TV
Puttin' down the rock and roll
Wants me to send a donation
'Cause he's worried about my soul
He said, "Jesus walked on the water."
And I know that it's true
But sometimes I think that preacher man
Would like to do a little walkin' too

[Chorus]
But I ain't askin' nobody for nothin'
If I can't get it on my own
If you don't like the way I'm livin'
You just leave this long haired country boy alone

[Verse 3]
A poor girl wants to marry
And a rich girl wants to flirt
A rich man goes to college
And a poor man goes to work
A drunkard wants another drink of wine
And a politician wants your vote
I don't want much of nothin' at all
But I will take another toke

[Chorus]
But I ain't askin' nobody for nothin'
If I can't get it on my own
If you don't like the way I'm livin'
You just leave this long haired country boy alone



The Devil went down to Georgia. He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind cause he was way behind. He was willing to make a deal
When he came across this young man sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the Devil jumped upon a hickory stump and said "Boy, let me tell you what."

"I bet you didn't know it, but I'm a fiddle player, too
And if you'd care to take a dare I'll make a bet with you
Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the Devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your soul cause I think I'm better than you."

The boy said, "My name's Johnny, and it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet; and you're gonna regret cause I'm the best there's ever been."

Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard
Cause Hell's broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards
And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose the devil gets your soul

The Devil opened up his case and he said, "I'll start this show."
And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow
And he pulled the bow across the strings and it made an evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this:

[Demonic violin piece]

When the Devil finished, Johnny said, "Well, you're pretty good ol' son
But sit down in that chair right there and let me show you how it's done."

"Fire on the Mountain." Run, boys, run!
The Devil's in the house of the rising sun;
Chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no

[Non-demonic violin piece]

The Devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny's feet
Johnny said, "Devil, just come on back if you ever wanna try again
Cause I've told you once--you son of a bitch--I'm the best there's ever been."
And he played:

"Fire on the Mountain." Run, boys, run!
The Devil's in the house of the rising sun;
Chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no



[Verse 1]
If you ever go back into Wooley Swamp son you better not go at night
There's things out there in the middle of them woods
That'd make a strong man die from fright
There's things that crawl and things that fly
And things that creep around on the ground
And they say the ghost of Lucius Clay gets up and it walks around

[Chorus]
But I couldn't believe it, I just had to find out for myself
And I couldn't conceive it, I never would listen to nobody else
No I couldn't believe it, I just had to find out for myself
That there's some things in this world you just can't explain

[Verse 2]
The old man lived in the Wooley Swamp way back in the gurgling woods
And he never did do a lot of harm in the world
But he never did do no good
People didn't think too much of him
They all thought he acted funny
The old man didn't care about people anyway
All he cared about was his money
He'd stuff it all down into Mason jars and bury it all around
And on certain nights if the moon was right
He'd dig it up out of the ground
He'd pour it all out on the floor of his shack
And run his fingers through it
Yeah, Lucius Clay was a greedy old man
And that's all there ever was to it

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The Crayton boys was white trash
And they lived over on Parvis Creek
They were a real snake and sneaky as a cat
And belligerent when they'd speak
One night the oldest brother said ya'll meet in the Wooley Swamp later
We'll get old Lucius' money and we'll pitch him to the alligators
They found the old man out in the back with a shovel in his hand
And thirteen rusty Mason jars he just dug up out of the sand
And they all went crazy and they beat the old man
Then they picked him up off the ground
Then they threw him in the swamp and they stood there and laughed
As the black water sucked him down
Then they turned around and went back to the shack
And they picked up the money and ran
But they hadn't gone nowhere when they realized
They were running in quicksand
And they struggled and screamed but they couldn't get away
Then just before they went under
They could hear that old man laughing
In a voice that was loud as thunder

[Bridge]
Now that's been fifty years ago an' if you go back by there again
There's a spot in the yard in back of that shack
Where the ground is always wet
And on certain nights if the moon is right
And you're down by the dark footpath
You can hear three young men screaming
And you can hear that old man laugh

[Chorus]



[Verse 1]
Well the train to Grinder's Switch is runnin' right on time
And the tucker boys are cookin' down in Caroline
People down in Florida can't be still
When old Lynyrd Skynyrd's pickin' down in Jacksonville
People down in Georgia come from near and far
To hear Richard Betts pickin' on that red guitar

[Refrain]
So gather 'round, gather 'round children
Get down, well just get down children
Get loud, well you can be loud and be proud
And you can be proud here
And I'll be proud to a rebel 'cause South's gonna do it again
And again

[Verse 2]
Elvin Bishop's sittin' on a bale of hay
He ain't good lookin' but he sure can play
And there's Z Z Top and you can't forget
That old brother Willie's gettin' soakin' wet
And all the good people down in Tennessee
Are diggin' barefoot Jerry and the C.D.B

[Refrain]
Well gather 'round, gather 'round children
Get down, well you can get down children
Get loud, well you can get loud and be proud
Well you can be proud here
Be proud to a rebel 'cause South's gonna do it again
Yes it is



[Verse]
I was taking a trip out to L.A
Tooling along in my Chevrolet
Taking on a number and digging on the radio
Just as I crossed the Mississippi line
I heard that highway start to whine
And I knew that left rear tire was about to blow
Well the spare was flat and I got uptight
Cause there wasn't a filling station in sight
So I just limped on down the shoulder on the rim
I went as far as I could and when I stopped the car
It was right in front of this little bar
Kind of a red-neck looking joint called the Dew Drop Inn
I stuffed my hair up under my hat
And told the bartender that I had a flat
And would he be kind enough to give me change for a one
There was one thing I was sure proud to see
There wasn't a soul in the place except for him and me
He just looked disgusted and pointed toward the telephone
I called up the station down the road a ways
He said he wasn't very busy today
And he could have someone out there in just about 10 minutes or so
He said, "Now, you just stay right where yer at!"
And I didn't bother to tell the darn fool
That I sure as hell didn't have anyplace else to go
I just ordered up a beer and sat down at the bar
When some guy walked in and said, "Who owns this car
With the peace sign, the mag wheels and the four on the floor?"
He looked at me and I damn near died
And I decided that I'd just wait outside
So I laid a dollar on the bar and headed for the door
Just when I thought I'd get out of there with my skin
These 5 big dudes come strolling in
With one old drunk chick and some fella with green teeth
I was almost to the door when the biggest one
Said, "You tip your hat to this lady, son!"
And when I did, all that hair fell out from underneath
Now the last thing I wanted was to get into a fight
In Jackson Mississippi on a Saturday night
Especially when there was three of them and only one of me
They all started laughing and I felt kinda sick
And I knew I better think of something pretty quick
So I just reached out and kicked old green teeth right in the knee
Now he let out a yell that'd curl your hair
But before he could move I grabbed me a chair
And said "Now watch him Folks cause he's a thoroughly dangerous man!"
"You may not know it but this man is a spy
He's a undercover agent for the FBI
And he's been sent down here to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan!"
He was still bent over holding on to his knee
But everybody else was looking and listening to me
And I laid it on thicker and heavier as I went
I said, "Would you believe this man has gone as far
As tearing Wallace stickers off the bumpers of cars
And he voted for George McGovern for President."
"Well, he's a friend of them long haired, hippy-type, pinko fags!
I bet you he's even got a commie flag
Tacked up on the wall inside of his garage."
"He's a snake in the grass, I tell you guys
He may look dumb but that's just a disguise
He's a mastermind in the ways of espionage"
They all started looking real suspicious at him
And he jumped up and said "Now just wait a minute Jim!
You know he's lying I been living here all of my life!"
"I'm a faithful follower of Brother John Birch
And I belong to the Antioch Baptist Church
And I ain't even got a garage, you can call home and ask my wife!"
Then he started saying something bout the way I was dressed
But I didn't wait around to hear the rest
I was too busy moving and hoping I didn't run out of luck
When I hit the ground I was making tracks
And they were just taking my car down off the jacks
So I threw the man a twenty and jumped in and fired that mother up
Mario Andretti would be sure been proud
Of the way I was moving when I passed that crowd
Coming out the door and headed toward me at a trot
And I guess I should of gone ahead and run
But somehow I just couldn't resist the fun
Of chasing them all just once around the parking lot
Well they headed for their car, but I hit the gas
And spun around and headed them off at the pass
I was slinging gravel and putting a ton of dust in the air
I had them all out there stepping and fetching
Like their heads was on fire and their asses was catching
Then I figured I had better go ahead and split before the cops got there
When I hit the road I was really wheeling
Had gravel flying and rubber squealing
And I didn't slow down till I was almost to Arkansas
I think I'm going to reroute my trip
I wonder if anybody'd think I'd flipped
If I went to L.A., via Omaha



You made me cry when you said good-bye
Ain't that a shame...my tears fall like rain
Ain't that a shame...you're the one to blame
You broke my heart, now we're apart
Ain't that a shame...my tears fall like rain
Ain't that a shame...you're the one to blame

Ah, yes you are
Farewell, good-bye, although I'll cry
Ain't that a shame...my tears fall like rain
Ain't that a shame...you're the one to blame

Ah!
You made me cry when you said good-bye
Ain't that a shame...my tears fall like rain
Ain't that a shame...you're the one to blame



The dream police
They live inside of my head
The dream police
They come to me in my bed
The dream police
They're coming to arrest me
Oh no

You know that talk is cheap
And those rumors ain't nice
And when I fall asleep
I don't think I'll survive

The night
The night

Cause they're waiting for me
Looking for me
Every single night
They're driving me insane
Those men inside my brain

The dream police
They live inside of my head
(live inside of my head)
The dream police
They come to me in my bed
(come to me in my bed)
The dream police
They're coming to arrest me
Oh no

Well I can't tell lies
Cause they're listening to me
And when I fall asleep
Bet they're spying on me tonight
Tonight

Cause they're waiting for me
Looking for me
Every single night
They're driving me insane
Those men inside my brain

I try to sleep
They're wide awake
They won't let me alone
They don't get paid to take vacations
Or let me alone
They spy on me
I try to hide
They won't let me alone
They persecute me
They're the judge and jury all in one

Cause they're waiting for me
Looking for me
Every single night
They're driving me insane
Those men inside my brain

The dream police
They live inside of my head
(live inside of my head)
The dream police they come
To me in my bed
(come to me in my bed)
The dream police
They're coming to arrest me

The dream police (police, police)
The dream police (police, police)

[Outro]



When I'm down I make a call
Got the number written on the wall
First it's busy then I try again
Oh, who's she talking to, could it be him?

I got the number and it starts to ring
I get excited and I start to dream
I start to fantasize of memory lane
Then she answers and she says right way
She says I'm home on my own, home all alone
So I got off the phone

(She's tight.) She's ahead of her time
(She's tight.) She's one of a kind
(She's tight.) She's a talented girl
(She's tight.) She's got her head down tight

I have something got to say to you
Amnesia and my train of thought
On the tip, tip of my tongue
I had a vision when I was young

You floated in, we floated up
Through the window and down the hall
I had a smoke and went upstairs
Turned the door and opened the key. She spoke...
I'm on my own, home all alone
So I got off the phone

(She's tight.) She's ahead of her time
(She's tight.) She's one of a kind
(She's tight.) She's a talented girl
(She's tight.) She's got her head down tight

(She's tight.) She's giving me the go
(She's tight.) She's giving me the high sign
(She's tight.) We'll turn off the lights
(She's tight.) Pull down the shades
(She's nice, she's tight.) Turn on the cam'ra
(She's nice, she's tight.) And getting ready for action

Turn off the radio
Turn on the video



[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Mother told me, yes, she told me
That I'd meet girls like you
She also told me, "Stay away
You'll never know what you'll catch"
Just the other day I heard
Of a soldier's falling off
Some Indonesian junk
That's going 'round

[Chorus]
Mommy's alright
Daddy's alright
They just seem a little weird
Surrender
Surrender
But don't give yourself away
Hey, hey

[Verse 2]
Father says, "Your mother's right
She's really up on things
Before we married, Mommy served
In the WACS in the Philippines”
Now, I had heard the WACs recruited
Old maids for the war
But mommy isn't one of those
I've known her all these years

[Chorus]
Mommy's alright
Daddy's alright
They just seem a little weird
Surrender
Surrender
But don't give yourself away
Hey, hey

[Verse 3]
Whatever happened to all this season's
Losers of the year?
Every time I got to thinking
Where'd they disappear?
But when I woke up, Mom and Dad
Are rolling on the couch
Rolling numbers, rock and rollin'
Got my KISS records out

[Chorus]
Mommy's alright
Daddy's alright
They just seem a little weird
Surrender
Surrender
But don't give yourself away
Hey, hey
Away
Away

[Outro]
Surrender (Mommy's all right)
Surrender (Daddy's all right)
But don't give yourself away
Surrender (Mommy's all right)
Surrender (Daddy's all right)
But don't give yourself away (2x)



Awoke
When the light
Hit me right in the temple
Felt something cold
Touch my toes as it passed

Might not be
The face you'd expect
But he's clearly insane
Got me pegged in the back

Just need a
Bit of luck
Get 'em up, point the gun
At the eyes
Or
At the knees, had to shoot
Had to fight
Gonna take out the gunman

Bit of luck
Get 'em up
Made to run for our lives
Take out the knees
Had to choose
Had to fight
Gonna take out the gunman

Eyes
Huge
So little left if something
Cracks and clues
He's crazy as a straw
Why... Denied... Does no one care or nothing
How, they ask, I ever last so long

Cause I, I went blind
A blinding riot
He's regretting every word

Those empty lies
One more tonight
My blinding riot
As I summon every nerve

Just need a
Bit of luck
Get 'em up, point the gun
At the eyes
Or
At the knees, had to shoot
Had to fight
Gonna take out the gunman

Bit of luck
Get 'em up
Made to run for our lives
Take out the knees
Had to choose
Had to fight
Gonna take out the gunman (x3)

(Gonna take out) x4

Just need a
Bit of luck
Get 'em up, point the gun
At the eyes
Or
At the knees, had to shoot
Had to fight
Gonna take out the gunman

Bit of luck
Get 'em up
Made to run for our lives
I'm so amazed at the way
We televise

Gonna take out the gunman (x4)



[Verse 1]
Waiting for the break of day
Searching for something to say
Dancing lights against the sky
Giving up I close my eyes
Sitting cross-legged on the floor
Twenty five or six to four

[Verse 2]
Staring blindly into space
Getting up to splash my face
Wanting just to stay awake
Wondering how much I can take
Should I try to do some more?
Twenty five or six to four

{Instrumental}

[Verse 3]
Feeling like I ought to sleep
Spinning room is sinking deep
Searching for something to say
Waiting for the break of day
Twenty five or six to four
Twenty five or six to four



[Verse 1]
When I'm with you, it doesn't matter where we are
Or what we're doing. I'm with you, that's all that matters
Time passes much too quickly when we're together laughing
I wish I could sing it to you, oh no
I wish I could sing it to you

[Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh [2x]

Mostly I'm silent mmm silent la la la la la
Never think about words to say

[Verse 2]
When I kiss you, I feel a thousand different feelings
The color of chills all over my body
And when I feel them, I quickly try to decide which one
I should try to put into words, oh no
Try to put into words

[Chorus]

Mostly I'm silent silent la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Silent

Only the beginning of what I want to feel forever yeah
Oh no whoa yes
Only the beginning. Only just the start
I've got to get you into my life
Got to get you next to me
Only the beginning. Only just the start

Only the beginning... (repeat to fade)



I do believe in you
And I know you believe in me
Oho, yeah
Oho, yeah

But now we've realized
Love's not all that it's supposed to be
Oho, yeah
Oho, yeah

And knowing that you would have wanted it this way
I do believe I'm feelin' stronger every day

I know we really tried
Together we had love inside
Oho, yeah
Oho, yeah

So now the time has come
For both of us to live on the run
Oho, yeah
Oho, yeah

And knowing that you would have wanted it this way
I do believe I'm feelin' stronger every day
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

After what you meant to me
Oooh, baby now
I can make it easily
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I know that we both agree
Best thing to happen to you
The best thing that happened to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

(We love you
We love you
It's a gas, gas, gas)

Feelin' stronger every day
Feelin' stronger every day
Feelin' stronger every day (You know I'm all right now)

Feelin' stronger every day (You know I'm all right now)
Feelin' stronger every day (You know I'm all right now)
Feelin' stronger every day (You know I'm all right now)



Well my pad is very messy, got whiskers on my chin
Never had no problems 'cause I've always paid the rent
I got no time for lovin'
Cause my time is all used up
I stand outside creatin'
All the groovy kinds of love

I'm a man, yes I am and I can't help but love you so
I'm a man, yes I am and I can't help but love you so

If I had my choice of matter
I'd would rather be with cats
All engrossed in mental chatter
Showing where your mind is at
While relating to each other
How strong the love can be
By resisting all the good times with each groovy chick we see

I'm a man yes I am and I can't help but love you so
I'm a man yes I am and I can't help but love you so

I've got to keep my image
While I'm standing on the floor
If I drop upon my knees
It's just to keep them on my nose
You think that I'm not human
And my heart is made of stone
But I've never had no problems
'Cause my body's pretty strong

I'm a man yes I am and I can't help but love you so
I'm a man yes I am and I can't help but love you so
I'm a man yes I am and I can't help but love you so

If I had my choice of matter
I would rather be with cats
All engrossed in mental chatter
Showin' where your mind is at
While relating to each other
How strong your love can be
By resisting all the good times with each groovy chick we see

I'm a man yes I am and I can't help but love you so
I'm a man yes I am and I can't help but love you so
I'm a man yes I am and I can't help but love you so

I gotta keep my image
While I'm standin on the floor
If I drop upon my knees
It's just to keep them on my nose
You think that I'm not human
And my heart is made of stone
But I never had no problems
'Cause my body's pretty strong

I'm a man, yes I am, and I can't help but love you so
Man, yes I am, and I can't help but love you so
Man, yes I am, and I can't help but love you so
Man, yes I am, and I can't help but love you so



Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah
You are my love and my life

Baby, you're everything
I've ever dreamed of
Yeah, yeah

Promise you'll never leave me

Just you 'n' me

Let me in, let me in, let me in
Love me tonight, yeah
Love me forever and ever

Just you 'n' me to carry on
Simple and free my lovely
To flow as one as love's reward
Lovin' you girl is so damn easy

Ooh, baby, you're everything

[Verse 1]
Children play in the park, they don't know
I'm alone in the dark, even though
Time and time again I see your face smiling inside

[Chorus 1]
I'm so happy
That you love me
Life is lovely
When you're near me
Tell me you will stay
Make me smile

[Verse 2]
Living life is just a game, so they say
All the games we used to play fade away
We may now enjoy the dreams we shared so long ago

[Chorus 2]
Oh my darling
Got to have you
Feel the magic
When I hold you
Cry sweet tears of joy
Touch the sky

[Brass Solo]

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus 3]
Now I need you
More than ever
No more crying
We're together
Tell me you will stay
Make me smile



[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Can this feeling that we have together
Oooh, Suddenly exist between
Did this meeting of our minds together
Oooh, Happen just today, somewhere

[Chorus]
I'd like to know
Can you tell me - please don't tell me
It really doesn't matter anyhow
It's just that the thought of us so happy
Appears in my mind, as a beautifully mysterious thing

Yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
Was your image in my mind so deeply
Oooh, other faces fade away
Blocking memories of unhappy hours
Oooh, Leavin' just a burnin' love

[Chorus]
Got to know now baby

[Instrumental Solo]

[Verse 3]
Can this lovin' we have found within us
Oooh, Suddenly exist between
Did we somehow try to make it happen
Oooh, Was it just a natural thing

[Chorus]
Yes it does now baby

And I still don't know where I'm going

[Chorus 3]
But without my baby
I better not stay

[Outro]
I better not stay, no ow woah no



[Verse 1]
Deep down Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play the guitar just like a ringing a bell

[Chorus]
Go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 2]
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by they would stop and say
Oh my that little country boy could play

[Chorus]
Go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 3]
His mother told him "Someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big old band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun go down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Saying 'Johnny B. Goode Tonight'"

[Chorus]
Go, go
Go Johnny go
Go go go, Johnny go
Oh go go, Johnny go
Oh go go, Johnny go
Go, Johnny B. Goode



I took a walk down a road
It's the road I was meant to stay
I see the fire in your eyes
But a man's got to make his way

So are you tough enough for my love
Just close your eyes to the heaven above
I'm coming home
I'm coming home

I took a ride in a world
I'll be spinnin' for the rest of my life
I feel your heart beatin' baby
Ooh sometimes it cuts like a knife

So are you tough enough for my love
Just close your eyes to the heaven above
I'm coming home
I'm coming home

I'm coming home
Where your love tonight can shine on me
I'm coming home
Where your lovin' arms can set me free

I took a walk down a road
It's the road I was meant to stay
I see the fire in your eyes
But a mans got to make his way

So are you tough enough for my love
Just close your eyes to the heaven above
I'm coming home
I'm coming home

I'm coming home
Oh yea
I'm on my way
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Here we go
Ooh yea, ooh yea
I'm on my way

Come on baby, Come on
Let your love, shine on me
I'm on my way, Sing along
Shine on, Shine on, Shine on me
I'm on my way, Ahh yea
Shine on me

I'm on my way
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
I'm on my way



I canâ??t tell ya baby what went wrong
I canâ??t make you feel what you felt so long ago
Iâ??ll let it show
I canâ??t give you back whatâ??s been hurt
Heartaches come and go and all thatâ??s left are the words
I canâ??t let go
If we take some time to think it over baby
Take some time, let me know
If you really want to go

Donâ??t know what you got till itâ??s gone
Donâ??t know what it is I did so wrong
Now I know what I got
Itâ??s just this song
And it ainâ??t easy to get back
Takes so long

I canâ??t feel the things that cause you pain
I canâ??t clear my heart of your love it falls like rain
Ainâ??t the same
I hear you calling far away
Tearing through my soul I just canâ??t take another day
Whoâ??s to blame
If we take some time to think it over baby
Take some time let me know
If you really want to go

Donâ??t know what you got 'till itâ??s gone
Donâ??t know what it is I did so wrong
Now I know what I got
Itâ??s just this song
And it ainâ??t easy to get back
Takes so long

Do you want to see me begginâ?? baby
Canâ??t you give me just one more day
Canâ??t you see my heartâ??s been dragginâ?? lately
Iâ??ve been lookinâ?? for the words to say

Donâ??t know what you got 'till itâ??s gone
Donâ??t know what it is I did so wrong
Now I know what I got
Itâ??s just this song
And it ainâ??t easy to get back
Takes so long

Donâ??t know what you got 'till itâ??s gone no
Donâ??t know what it is I did so wrong
Now I know what I got
Itâ??s just this song
And it ainâ??t easy to get back
Takes so long



I used to be now I'm not what you see, Lord I try
And now it seems all those dreams have come true, but they're passing me by
Some fast talkin' mama for a dollar put a smile on my face
I'm drivin' all night
I end up in the same old place

My gypsy road can't take me home
I drive all night just to see the light
My gypsy road can't take me home
I keep on pushin' cause it feels alright

And who's to care if I grow my hair to the sky
I'll take a wish and a prayer cross my fingers cause I always get by
Some fast talkin' jerk for a dollar wiped the smile off my face
I'm drivin' all night
Just to keep the rat in the race

My gypsy road can't take me home
I drive all night just to see the light
My gypsy road can't take me home
I keep on pushin' cause it feels alright

Sometimes I feel so old
Got my lights burnin' bright
But I'm lookin' pretty sold
Sometimes I feel so cold
So cold
Let's go

Got to get on home
My gypsy road can't take me home
My gypsy road can't take me home, t-t-take me

My gypsy road can't take me home
I drive all night just to see the light
My gypsy road can't take me home
I keep on pushin' cause it feels alright

My gypsy road can't take me home
I drive all night just to see the light
My gypsy road can't take me home
I keep on p-p-pushin'

My gypsy road
My gypsy road
My gypsy road
My gypsy road

My gypsy road

My gypsy road can't take me home
I drive all night just to see the light
My gypsy road can't take me home



I count the falling tears
They fall before my eyes
Seems like a thousand years
Since we broke the ties
I call you on the phone
But never get a rise
So sit there all alone
It's time you realize

I'm not your fool
(Nobody's fool)
(Nobody's fool)
I'm no fool
(Nobody's fool)
(Nobody's fool)
Never again no no

You take your road I'll take mine
The paths have both been beaten
Searchin' for a change of pace
Life needs to be sweetened
I scream my heart out just to make a dime
And with that dime I bought your love
But now I've changed my mind

I'm not your fool
(Nobody's fool)
(Nobody's fool)
I'm no fool
(Nobody's fool)
(Nobody's fool)
Never again no no

(Nobody's fool)
(Nobody's fool)
I'm no fool
(Nobody's fool)
(Nobody's fool)

I count the falling tears
They fall before my eyes
Seems like a thousand years
Since we broke the ties, oh oh oh

I'm not your fool
(Nobody's fool)
(Nobody's fool)
I'm no fool
(Nobody's fool)
(Nobody's fool)
I'm no fool
(Nobody's fool)
(Nobody's fool)
I'm no fool
(Nobody's fool)
(Nobody's fool)

(Nobody's fool)
(Nobody's fool)
(Nobody's fool)
(Nobody's fool)

(Nobody's fool)
(Nobody's fool)
No-oh-oh-oh
(Nobody's fool)
(Nobody's fool)
No, I'm not your fool
(Nobody's fool)
(Nobody's fool)



When I was a young boy
They said, "You're only gettin' older"
But how was I to know then
That they'd be cryin' on my shoulder

Put your money in a big house
Get yourself a pretty wife
She'll collect your life insurance
When she connects you with a knife

Somebody get the doctor
I'm feelin' pretty poor
Somebody get the stretcher
Before I hit the floor

Somebody save me, I lost my job
They kicked me out of my tree
Somebody save me, save me

And everybody's got opinions
But nobody's got the answers
And that shit you ate for breakfast
Well, it'll only give you cancer

We're runnin' in a circle
Runnin' to the morning light
And if ya ain't quite workable
It's been one hell of a night

Somebody get the doctor
I think I'm gonna crash
Never paid the bill
Because I ain't got the cash

Somebody save me, I lost my job
They kicked me out of my tree
Somebody save me, save me, look out

Save me, I lost my job
They kicked me out of my tree
Somebody save me, oh, save me

Somebody save me
I'm goin' down for the last time, look out
Save me, save me, save me



You are sultry, dirty, soft and hard
You are close to me and you're so far
And I'm thinking of the time we spent together
Now I'll bury this in my backyard

Sometimes I sit and wonder
But I'll never dial your number
'Cause I'm having fun looking out for number one
And I'm doing all the things I like to do
I'm having fun cause I knew it all along
I'd be better off without you

You are guilty, pretty, high and low
You're a place to stay and a time to go
And I'm searching through the things you left behind here
Now it's time for me to let it go

Sometimes I sit and wonder
But I'll never dial that number
'Cause I'm having fun looking out for number one
And I'm doin all the things I like to do
I'm having fun 'cause I knew it all along
I'd be better off without you

Late at night you pick up the telephone
Call me up and cry 'cause you're all alone
I don't care
Apologize for taking my cigarettes
Now it's time to feel all the side effects
Missing the life you had

Now I'm having fun looking out for number one
And I'm doing all the things I like to do
I'm having fun cause I knew it all along
I'd be better off without you
Better off without you
Better off without you



Vincent will you teach me how to paint?
Teresa will I ever be a saint?
John I really think your songs are great
I was born too late

William will you teach me how to write?
Cassius will you show me how to fight?
Thomas A. I think I see the light
I was born tonight

I’ve had a hard time leaving this town
I’ve been losing everything that I found
I’m gonna search the sky, kiss the ground
Build it up and tear it back down

I’ve had a hard time leaving this place
I’ve been counting all the lines on my face
I’m gonna curse the sky, hit the ground
What goes up comes tumbling down
Tumbling down (spoken)

Jimi show me how you play that thing
Elvis will I ever be a king?
Jerry all the joy and love you bring
I was born to sing

Martin Luther King show me the way
Jesus, Buddha teach me how to pray
Christopher I think I see the bay
I was born today
I was born today



In a black and far off corner of my mind
There's a box of something I can't quite define
It houses circus freaks, temptation and bad trips
In an isolated corner of the box
There's a trap door covered up with dirt and rocks
It opens to the stairs that lead down to the crypt

Do you know where you're going when you've taken your last step
Do you know what you get?
Cigarette

On a dark and lonely road in my hometown
Stands a house that long ago should've been torn down
It reeks of love gone sour, suspicion and bad debt
On a weather beaten transom in the house
Walks a friend of mine that I call the old king mouse
He dances in the moonlight and sleeps out on the steps

Do you know where you're going when you've taken your last breath?
Do you know what you get?
Do you know where you're going when they've paid their last regrets?
Do you know what you get?
Cigarette

In a black and far off corner of my mind
There's a box of something I can't quite define
It houses circus freaks, temptation and the Fayette County Fair
And it reeks of love gone sour, suspicion and big hair

Do you know where you're going when you've taken your last breath?
Do you know what you get?
Do you know where you're going when the devil starts to sweat?
Do you know what you get?
A cigarette



[Intro]

[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
Hey you, out there in the cold
Getting lonely getting old
Can you feel me?
Hey you, standing in the aisles
With itchy feet and fading smiles
Can you feel me?
Hey you, don't help them to bury the light
Don't give in without a fight

[Verse 2: Gilmour]
Hey you, out there on your own
Sitting naked by the phone
Would you touch me?
Hey you, with your ear against the wall
Waiting for someone to call out
Would you touch me?
Hey you, would you help me to carry the stone?
Open your heart, I'm coming home

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge: Roger Waters]
But it was only fantasy
The wall was too high, as you can see
No matter how he tried, he could not break free
And the worms ate into his brain

[Bass Break]

[Verse 3/Outro: Waters]
Hey you, out there on the road
Always doing what you're told
Can you help me?
Hey you, out there beyond the wall
Breaking bottles in the hall
Can you help me?
Hey you, don't tell me there's no hope at all
Together we stand, divided we fall



Maybe I should turn and walk away
Maybe I should run, but I'll probably bow my head and pray
Maybe I'll search the lost and found
Maybe like two boxers bloodied, dizzied by the seventh round

Maybe circumstances make it easier to quit
Maybe in our circle, square pieces never fit
But I want you to know

I've never walked away from the things I've wanted
I've never walked away, but I think I'm going to
This time
I've never walked away from the things I've wanted
I've never walked away, but I think I'm going to
This time

Maybe I'll move back across town
Maybe in a week or two, we can talk, but not right now
Maybe your mind plays tricks on me
Maybe it's the drawer of letters everyday I read

Maybe these tears don't look so gallant
Maybe it's a chemical imbalance
Maybe it's the lack of sunlight
But I want you to know
Still I want you to know

I've never walked away from the things I've wanted
I've never walked away, but I think I'm going to
This time
I've never walked away from the things I've wanted
I've never walked away, but I think I'm going to
This time

Maybe it hurts below the skin
Maybe lessons finally sinking in
Maybe getting in the last word doesn't really mean you win



There's a penny on the floor and you're gone
The television's on
Have you found another man to take my place

There's a penny on the floor and I'm wise
I try to see in your eyes
But all I see is a reflection of my face

There's a penny on the floor and you're gone
I'm tryin' to right what's wrong
A stronger man might do it with more grace

There's a penny on the floor and I'm wise
I look up to the skies
I cry and pray and I stare out into space

There's a penny on the floor and you're standin' at the door
Turn around and say good bye
A woman like you comes around just once a life

There's a penny on the floor and I'm strong
I try to carry on
Realize that no one can take your place

There's a penny on the floor and I'm fine
I know its gonna take some time
Before I look at you without lookin' at my own face

A penny on the floor
I'm tired of the war
A penny on the track
Are you comin' back?

There's a penny on the floor and it stays
As a tribute to the days
That were spent with you
No one can take them away

There's a penny on the floor and it stays
As a tribute to the ways
You filled my soul with courage, hope, and grace

There's a penny on the floor and you're standin' at the door
Turn around and say good bye
A woman like you comes around just once a life

There's a penny on the floor and you're standin' at the door
Turn around and say good bye
A woman like you comes around
And won't bring me down



I come from down in the valley
Where, mister, when you're young
They bring you up to do like your daddy done
Well, Mary, we met in high school
She was just seventeen
We'd drive outta this valley
Down to where the fields were green

We'd go down to the river
And into the river we'd dive
Oh, down to the river we'd ride

Well, I got Mary pregnant
And, man, that was all she wrote
Before my nineteenth birthday
I got a union card and a wedding coat
We went down to the courthouse
And the judge brought it all to rest
No wedding day smiles
No walk down the aisles
No flowers, no wedding dress

We'd go down to the river
And into the river we'd dive
Oh, down to the river we'd ride

I got a job working construction
For the Johnstown company
Lately, there ain't been much work
On account of the economy
All those things that seemed so important
Well, they just vanish in the air
And I act like I don't remember
Mary acts like she don't care
And I remember us riding in my brother's car
About ten and went around the reservoir
At night on the banks, I'd lie awake
And pull her close to feel each breath she'd take
Those memories come back to haunt me
Well, they haunt me like a curse
Is a dream a lie that don't come true
Or is it something worse?

And we'd go down to the river
And into the river we'd dive
Oh, down to the river we'd ride
Down to the river, my baby and I
Oh, down to the river, we'd ride



[Verse 1]
Why drink the water from my hand
Contagious as you think I am
Just tilt my sun towards your domain
Your cup runneth over again

[Chorus]
Don't scream about, don't think aloud
Turn your head now baby just spit me out
Don't worry about, don't speak of doubt
Turn your head now baby just spit me out

[Verse 2]
Why follow me to higher ground
Lost as you swear I am
Don't throw away your basic needs
Ambiance and vanity

[Chorus]
Don't scream about, don't think aloud
Turn your head now baby just spit me out
Don't worry about, don't speak of doubt
Turn your head now baby just spit me out

Don't scream about, don't think aloud
Turn your head now baby just spit me out
Don't worry about, don't speak of doubt
Turn your head now baby just spit me out

[Bridge]
December promise you gave unto me
December whispers of treachery
December clouds are now covering me
December songs no longer I sing
December promise you gave unto me
December whispers of treachery
December clouds are now covering me
December songs no longer I sing

[Chorus + Bridge Overlay]
Don't scream about, don't think aloud
Turn your head now baby just spit me out
Don't worry about, don't speak of doubt
Turn your head now baby just spit me out

Don't scream about, don't think aloud
Turn your head now baby just spit me out
Don't worry about, don't speak of doubt
Turn your head now baby just spit me out



Give me a word
Give me a sign
Show me where to look
Tell me what will I find
Lay me on the ground
Fly me in the sky
Show me where to look
Tell me what will I find
Oh, heaven let your light shine down

Love is in the water
Love is in the air
Show me where to look
Tell me will love be there
Teach me how to speak
Teach me how to share
Teach me where to go
Tell me will love be there
Oh, heaven let your light shine down

Give me a word
Give me a sign
Show me where to look
Tell me what will I find
Lay me on the ground
Fly me in the sky
Show me where to look
Tell me what will I find
Oh, heaven let your light shine down

I'm gonna let it shine
I'm gonna let it shine
Heaven send a light, let it shine on me
Hey yeah
Hey yeah
Heaven send a light, let it shine on me
It's gonna shine on
Shine on me
Its gonna shine on
Well come on and shine



[Verse 1]
Has our conscious shown?
Has the sweet breeze blown?
Has all kindness gone?
Hope still lingers on
I drink myself of new found pity
Sitting alone in New York City
And I don't know why

[Verse 2]
Are we listening?
Hymns of offering
Have we eyes to see?
Love is gathering
All the words that I've been reading
Have now started the act of bleeding
Into one
Into one

[Verse 3]
So I walk up on high
And I step to the edge
To see my world below
And I laugh at myself
While the tears roll down
Cause it's the world I know
It's the world I know

I drink myself of newfound pity
Sitting alone in New York City
And I don't know why, don't know why

[Verse 3]
So I walk up on high
And I step to the edge
To see my world below
And I laugh at myself
While the tears roll down
'Cause it's the world I know
Oh it's the world I know
So I walk up on high
And I step to the edge
To see my world below
And I laugh at myself
While the tears roll down
'Cause it's the world I know
Oh it's the world I know



My pappy said, "Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln."

Have you heard this story of the Hot Rod race
When Fords and Lincolns was settin' the pace
That story is true, I'm here to say
I was drivin' that Model A

It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up
That Model A Vitimix makes it look like a pup
It's got eight cylinders; uses them all
It's got overdrive, just won't stall

With a 4-barrel carb and a dual exhaust
With 4.11 gears you can really get lost
It's got safety tubes, but I ain't scared
The brakes are good, tires fair

Pulled out of San Pedro late one night
The moon and the stars was shinin' bright
We was drivin' up Grapevine Hill
Passing cars like they was standing still

All of a sudden in a wink of an eye
A Cadillac sedan passed us by
I said, "Boys, that's a mark for me!"
By then the taillight was all you could see

Now the fellas was ribbin' me for bein' behind
So I thought I'd make the Lincoln unwind
Took my foot off the gas and man alive
I shoved it on down into overdrive

Wound it up to a hundred-and-ten
My speedometer said that I hit top end
My foot was blue, like lead to the floor
That's all there is and there ain't no more

Now the boys all thought I'd lost my sense
And telephone poles looked like a picket fence
They said, "Slow down! I see spots!
The lines on the road just look like dots."

Took a corner; sideswiped a truck
Crossed my fingers just for luck
My fenders was clickin' the guardrail posts
The guy beside me was white as a ghost

Smoke was comin' from out of the back
When I started to gain on that Cadillac
Knew I could catch him, I thought I could pass
Don't you know by then we'd be low on gas?

We had flames comin' from out of the side
Feel the tension. Man! What a ride!
I said, "Look out, boys, I've got a license to fly!"
And that Caddy pulled over and let us by

Now all of a sudden she started to knockin'
And down in the dips she started to rockin'
I looked in my mirror; a red light was blinkin'
The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln!

They arrested me and they put me in jail
And called my pappy to throw my bail
And he said, "Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that Hot... Rod... Lincoln!"



We are playing in the monkey bars
Sittin' by the streets just countin' the cars
We are running from place to place
We're running around, like we're in a rat race
Monkey bars, swingin' stars
Countin' the cars, by the monkey bars
We've got a job in the Amazon
Everyone's a jungle, out to con
We drive for miles and see lots of trees
We get home in time to pay our managers fees
Monkey bars, swingin' stars
Countin' the cars, by the monkey bars
Eatin's easy when you're chimps like us
Banana splits are a definite plus
Things'll be better when we climb our way out
Our hands may slip, but not cause of doubt
Monkey bars, swingin' stars
Countin' the cars, by the monkey bars
Monkey bars, swingin' stars
Settin' up those pars by the monkey bars



Shalalala la la la
Uh huh

I was down at the New Amsterdam
Staring at this yellow-haired girl
Mr. Jones strikes up a conversation
With a black-haired flamenco dancer
You know she dances while his father plays guitar
She's suddenly beautiful
And we all want something beautiful
Man, I wish I was beautiful

So come dance this silence down through the morning
Shalalala la la la la, yeah..
Uh huh, yeah.. Cut up, Maria!
Show me some of them Spanish dances
And pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones
Believe in me, help me believe in anything
'Cause I wanna be someone who believes, yeah

Mr. Jones and me tell each other fairy tales
And we stare at the beautiful women
"She's looking at you. Ah, no, no, she's looking at me."
Smiling in the bright lights, coming through in stereo
When everybody loves you, you can never be lonely

Well, I'm gonna paint my picture
Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray
All of the beautiful colors are very, very meaningful
Yeah, well, you know gray is my favorite color
I felt so symbolic yesterday
If I knew Picasso, I would buy myself a gray guitar and play

Mr. Jones and me look into the future
Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women
"She's looking at you. I don't think so. She's looking at me."
Standing in the spotlight, I bought myself a gray guitar
When everybody loves me, I will never be lonely

I'll never be lonely
Said I'm never gonna be lonely

I want to be a lion
Yeah, everybody wants to pass as cats
We all want to be big, big stars, yeah
But we got different reasons for that
Believe in me, 'cause I don't believe in anything
And I, I want to be someone to believe
To believe, to believe, yeah!

Mr. Jones and me, stumbling through the barrio
Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women
"She's perfect for you, man, there's got to be somebody for me."
I want to be Bob Dylan
Mr. Jones wishes he was someone just a little more funky
When everybody loves you, ah son
That's just about as funky as you can be

Mr. Jones and me, staring at the video
When I look at the television, I want to see me
Staring right back at me
We all want to be big stars
But we don't know why, and we don't know how
But when everybody loves me
I want to be just about as happy as can be
Mr. Jones and me, we're gonna be big stars



Sometimes you wanna take you down
Sometimes I wanna get you low
Brush your hair back from your eyes
Take you down let the river flow

Sometimes I go and walk the street
Behind the green sheet of glass
A million miles below their feet
A million miles, a million miles

[Chorus]
I'll be with you girl
Like being low
Hey hey hey like being stoned
I'll be with you girl
Like being low
Hey hey hey like being stoned

A million poppies is gonna make me sleep
Just one rose and knows your name
The fruit is rusting on the vine
The fruit is calling from the trees

Hey don't you wanna go down
Like some junkie cosmonaut
A million miles below their feet
A million miles, a million miles

[Chorus]

Blue blue is the sun
A brown brown is the sky
A green green are her eyes
A million miles a million miles

Hey hey don't you wanna go down
Like some disgraced cosmonaut
A million miles below their feet
A million miles, a million miles



Thinkin' 'bout the times you drove in my car
Thinkin' that I might have drove you too far
And I'm thinkin' 'bout the love that you laid on my table

I told you not to wander 'round in the dark
I told you 'bout the swans that they live in the park
Then I told you 'bout our kid, now he's married to Mabel

Yes, I told you that the light goes up and down
Don't you notice how the wheel goes 'round?
And you'd better pick yourself up from the ground
Before they bring the curtain down
Yes, before they bring the curtain down, woo-ooh

Get up, get up, get up
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Talkin' 'bout a girl that looks quite like you
She didn't have the time to wait in the queue
She cried away her life since she fell off the cradle



Born under a bad sign
I've been down since I began to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck
I wouldn't have no luck at all

Bad luck and trouble is my only friend
I've been down ever since I was ten

Born under a bad sign
I've been down since I began to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck
I wouldn't have no luck at all

More wine and women is all I crave
Big bad women gonna carry me to my grave

Born under a bad sign
I've been down since I began to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck
I wouldn't have no luck at all

Bad luck and trouble's been my only friend
I've been down ever since I was ten

Born under a bad sign
I've been down since I began to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck
I wouldn't have no luck
If it wasn't for real bad luck
I wouldn't have no luck at all

Born under a bad sign
Born under a bad sign



I went down to the crossroads
Fell down on my knees
Down to the crossroads
Fell down on my knees
Asked the Lord above for mercy
"Take me, if you please"

I went down to the crossroads
Tried to flag a ride
Down to the crossroads
Tried to flag a ride
Nobody seemed to know me
Everybody passed me by

Well, I'm going down to Rosedale
Take my rider by my side
Going down to Rosedale
Take my rider by my side
You can still barrel house, baby
On the riverside

Going down to Ro'dale
Take my rider by my side
Going down to Rosedale
Take my rider by my side
You can still barrel house, baby
On the riverside

You can run, you can run
Tell my friend boy Willie Brown
Run, you can run
Tell my friend boy Willie Brown
And I'm standing at the crossroads
Believe I'm sinking down

(Spoken) Uh, Eric Clapton lead, uh vocal

[Verse 1]
It’s getting near dawn
And lights close their tired eyes
I’ll soon be with you, my love
To give you my dawn surprise
I’ll be with you darling soon
I’ll be with you when the stars start falling

[Chorus]
I’ve been waiting so long
To be where I’m going
In the sunshine of your love

[Verse 2]
I’m with you my love
The lights shining through on you
Yes I’m with you my love
It’s the morning and just we two
I’ll stay with you darling now
I’ll stay with you till my seas are dried up

[Chorus]
I’ve been waiting so long
To be where I’m going
In the sunshine of your love

[Verse 2]
I’m with you my love
The lights shining through on you
Yes I’m with you my love
It’s the morning and just we two
I’ll stay with you darling now
I’ll stay with you till my seas are dried up

[Chorus]
I’ve been waiting so long
I’ve been waiting so long
I’ve been waiting so long
To be where I’m going
In the sunshine of your love



You thought the leaden winter would bring you down forever
But you rode upon a steamer to the violence of the sun

And the colours of the sea bind your eyes with trembling mermaids
And you touch the distant beaches with tales of brave Ulysses
How his naked ears were tortured by the sirens sweetly singing
For the sparkling waves are calling you to kiss their white laced lips

And you see a girl's brown body dancing through the turquoise
And her footprints make you follow where the sky loves the sea
And when your fingers find her, she drowns you in her body
Carving deep blue ripples in the tissues of your mind

The tiny purple fishes run laughing through your fingers
And you want to take her with you to the hard land of the winter

Her name is Aphrodite and she rides a crimson shell
And you know you cannot leave her for you touched the distant sands
With tales of brave Ulysses, how his naked ears were tortured
By the sirens sweetly singing

The tiny purple fishes run lauging through your fingers
And you want to take her with you to the hard land of the winter



[Intro]

In the white room with black curtains near the station
Black roof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings
Silver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes
Dawnlight smiles on you leaving, my contentment

I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines
Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves

You said no strings could secure you at the station
Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows
I walked into such a sad time at the station
As I walked out, felt my own need just beginning

I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back
Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves

[Bridge]

At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd
Consolation for the old wound now forgotten
Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes
She's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings

I'll sleep in this place with the lonely crowd;
Lie in the dark where the shadows run from themselves

[Outro]



[Verse 1]
When dreaming I'm guided to another world
Time and time again
At sunrise I fight to stay asleep
Because I don't want to leave the comfort of this place
Because there's a hunger, a longing to escape
From the life I live when I'm awake

[Pre-Chorus]
So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask, "Can we stay?"

[Chorus]
Can you take me higher?
To a place where blind men see
Can you take me higher?
To a place with golden streets

[Verse 2]
Although I would like our world to change
It helps me to appreciate
Those nights and those dreams
But, my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights
If I could make the Earth and my dreams the same
The only difference is
To let love replace all our hate

[Pre-Chorus]
So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask, "Can we stay?"

[Chorus]
Can you take me higher?
To a place where blind men see
Can you take me higher?
To a place with golden streets

[Pre-Chorus]
So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask, "Can we stay?"

[Bridge]
Up high I feel like I'm alive for the very first time
Set up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams and make them mine
Set up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams and make them mine

[Chorus]
Can you take me higher?
To a place where blind men see
Can you take me higher?
To a place with golden streets

Can you take me higher?
To a place where blind men see
Can you take me higher?
To a place with golden streets



[Verse 1]
Hello my friend, we meet again
It's been a while, where should we begin?
Feels like forever
Within my heart are memories
Of perfect love that you gave to me
Oh I remember

[Chorus]
When you are with me, I'm free
I'm careless, I believe
Above all the others, we'll fly
This brings tears to my eyes
My sacrifice

[Verse 2]
We've seen our share of ups and downs
Oh, how quickly life can turn around
In an instant
It feels so good to reunite
Within yourself and within your mind
Let's find peace there

[Chorus]
Because when you are with me, I'm free
I'm careless, I believe
Above all the others, we'll fly
This brings tears to my eyes
My sacrifice

[Bridge]
I just want to see you again
I just want to see you again

[Chorus]
Because when you are with me, I'm free
I'm careless, I believe
Above all the others, we'll fly
This brings tears to my eyes
My sacrifice

Because when you are with me, I'm free
I'm careless, I believe
Above all the others, we'll fly
This brings tears to my eyes
My sacrifice

[Outro]
I just want to say hello again
I just want to say hello again
I just want to say hello again
My sacrifice



[Verse 1]
Well I just heard the news today
It seems my life is going to change
I closed my eyes, begin to pray
Then tears of joy stream down my face

[Chorus]
With arms wide open under the sunlight
Welcome to this place I'll show you everything
With arms wide open
With arms wide open

[Verse 2]
Well I don't know if I'm ready
To be the man I have to be
I'll take a breath, I'll take her by my side
We stand in awe, we've created life

[Chorus]
With arms wide open under the sunlight
Welcome to this place I'll show you everything
With arms wide open now everything has changed
I'll show you love, I'll show you everything

With arms wide open
Wide open

[Guitar Solo: Mark Tremonti]

[Verse 3]
If I had just one wish only one demand
I hope he's not like me, I hope he understands
That he can take this life and hold it by the hand
And he can greet the world with arms wide open

[Chorus]
With arms wide open under the sunlight
Welcome to this place I'll show you everything
With arms wide open now everything has changed
I'll show you love, I'll show you everything

With arms wide open
With arms wide open



I see the bad moon arising
I see trouble on the way
I see earthquakes and lightnin'
I see bad times today

Don't go around tonight
Well, it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

I hear hurricanes a blowing
I know the end is coming soon
I fear rivers overflowing
I hear the voice of rage and ruin

Don't go around tonight
Well, it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

Hope you got your things together
Hope you are quite prepared to die
Looks like we're in for nasty weather
One eye is taken for an eye

Well don't go around tonight
Well it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

Don't go around tonight
Well, it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise



[Intro]

Now, when I was just a little boy
Standin' to my Daddy's knee
My papa said, "Son, don't let the man get you
An' do what he done to me."
Because he'll get you
Because  he'll get you now, now
An' I can remember the fourth o' July
Runnin' through the backwood bare
An' I can still hear my ol' hound dog barkin'
Chasin' down a hoodoo there
Chasin' down a hoodoo there

Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou

Wish I was back on the Bayou
Rollin' with some Cajun Queen
Wishin' I were a fast freight train
Just a chooglin' on down to New Orleans

Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou

[Bridge]
Do it, do it, do it, do it. Oh, Lord
Oh get back boy

I can remember the fourth o' July
Runnin' through the backwood bare
An' I can still hear my ol' hound dog barkin'
Chasin' down a hoodoo there
Chasin' down a hoodoo there

Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou

[Outro]
All right! Do, do, do, do
Mmmmmmm, ohh



[Verse 1]
Traffic in the city turns my head around
No, no, no, no, no
Backed up on the freeway
Backed up in the church
Everywhere you look there's a frown, frown

[Chorus]
Com, commotion
Git, git, git, gone
Com, commotion
Git, git, git, gone

[Verse 2]
People keep a talking they don't say a word
Jaw, jaw, jaw, jaw, jaw
Talk up in the White House, talk up to your door
So much going on I just can't hear

[Chorus]
Com, commotion
Git, git, git, gone
Com, commotion
Git, git, git, gone

[Verse 3]
Hurrying to get there so you save some time
Run, run, run, run, run
Rushing to the treadmill, rushing to get home
Worry 'bout the time you save, save

[Chorus]
Com, commotion
Git, git, git, gone
Com, commotion
Git, git, git, gone
Com, commotion
Git, git, git, gone



Early in the evenin' just about supper time
Over by the courthouse they're starting to unwind
Four kids on the corner trying to bring you up
Willy picks a tune out and he blows it on the harp

Down On The Corner, out in the street
Willy and the Poorboys are playin';
Bring a nickel; tap your feet

Rooster hits the washboard and people just got to smile
Blinky, thumps the gut bass and solos for a while
Poorboy twangs the rhythm out on his kalamazoo
Willy goes into a dance and doubles on kazoo

Down On The Corner, out in the street
Willy and the Poorboys are playin';
Bring a nickel; tap your feet

Down On The Corner, out in the street
Willy and the Poorboys are playin';
Bring a nickel; tap your feet

You don't need a penny just to hang around
But if you've got a nickel, won't you lay your money down?
Over on the corner there's a happy noise
People come from all around to watch the magic boy

Down On The Corner, out in the street
Willy and the Poorboys are playin';
Bring a nickel; tap your feet

Down On The Corner, out in the street
Willy and the Poorboys are playin';
Bring a nickel; tap your feet

Down On The Corner, out in the street
Willy and the Poorboys are playin';
Bring a nickel; tap your feet



[Verse 1]
Some folks are born made to wave the flag
Ooh they're red, white and blue
And when the band plays Hail to the Chief
Ooh, they point the cannon at you, Lord

[Chorus ]
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no senator's son, son
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one, no

[Verse 2]
Some folks are born silver spoon in hand
Lord, don't they help themselves, no
But when the taxman comes to the door
Lord, the house looks like a rummage sale, yeah

[Chorus]
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no millionaire's son, no no
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one, no

[Verse 3]
Some folks inherit star spangled eyes
Ooh, they send you down to war, Lord
And when you ask them, "How much should we give?"
Ooh, they only answer More, more, more!

[Chorus/Outro]
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no military son, son
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one, one
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one, no no no
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate son, no no no



Well, take me back down where cool water flow, yeh
Let me remember things I love
Stoppin' at the log where catfish bite
Walkin' along the river road at night
Barefoot girls dancin' in the moonlight

I can hear the bull frog callin' me
Wonder if my rope's still hangin' to the tree
Love to kick my feet way down the shallow water
Shoe fly, dragon fly, get back to your mother
Pick up a flat rock, skip it across Green River

Up at Cody's camp I spent my days, oh
With flat car riders and cross-tie walkers
Old Cody, Junior took me over
Said, you're gonna find the world is smouldrin'
An' if you get lost come on home to Green River



Someone told me long ago
There's a calm before the storm
I know, it's been comin' for some time
When it's over, so they say
It'll rain a sunny day
I know, shinin' down like water

[Chorus]
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
Comin' down on a sunny day

Yesterday, and days before
Sun is cold and rain is hard
I know, been that way for all my time
'Til forever, on it goes
Through the circle, fast and slow
I know, it can't stop, I wonder

[Chorus]
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
Comin' down on a sunny day

Yeah!

[Chorus]
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
Comin' down on a sunny day



[Verse 1]
Bet you're wondering how I knew
About your plans to make me blue
With some other guy that you knew before?
Between the two of us guys, you know I love you more
It took me by surprise, I must say, when I found out yesterday

[Chorus]
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah

[Verse 2]
You know that a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losing you would end my life, you see
Because you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself that you found someone else
Instead

[Chorus]
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah

[Verse 3]
People say you "Hear from what you see
Not not not from what you hear."
I can't help being confused
If it's true, won't you tell me dear?
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy that you knew before?

[Chorus]
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah

[Chorus]
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah

[Guitar Solo Outro]



Just about a year ago
I set out on the road
Seekin´ my fame and fortune
Lookin´ for a pot of gold
Things got bad and things got worse
I guess you know the tune
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again

Rode in on the Greyhound
I´ll be walkin´ out if I go
I was just passin´ through
Must be seven seven months or more
Ran out of time and money
Looks like they took my friend
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again

The man from the magazine
Said I was on my way
Somewhere I lost connections
Ran out of songs to play
I came into town a one night stand
Looks like my plans fell through
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again

If I only had a dollar
For every song I´ve sung
And every time I had to play
While people sat there drunk
You know, I´d catch the next train
Back to where I live
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again



Just got home from Illinois, lock the front door, oh boy
Got to sit down, take a rest on the porch
Imagination sets in, pretty soon I'm singing
Doo, doo, doo, looking out my back door

There's a giant doing cartwheels
A statue wearing high heels
Look at all the happy creatures dancing on the lawn
A dinosaur Victrola, listening to Buck Owens
Doo, doo, doo, looking out my back door

Tambourines and elephants are playing in the band
Won't you take a ride on the flying spoon?
Doo doo doo
A wond'rous apparition, provided by magician
Doo, doo, doo, looking out my back door

Tambourines and elephants are playing in the band
Won't you take a ride on the flying spoon?
Doo, doo doo
Bother me tomorrow, today I'll buy no sorrows
Doo, doo, doo, looking out my back door

Forward troubles Illinois, lock the front door, oh boy
Look at all the happy creatures dancing on the lawn
Bother me tomorrow, today I'll buy no sorrows
Doo, doo, doo, looking out my back door



[Verse 1]
Left a good job in the city
Workin' for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleepin'
Worryin' 'bout the way things might have been
Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river

[Verse 2]
Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
Pumped a lot of 'pane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
'Til I hitched a ride on a river boat queen

[Refrain]
Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river

[Verse 3]
If you come down to the river
Bet you gonna find some people who live
You don't have to worry cause you have no money
People on the river are happy to give

[Refrain]
Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river


[Bridge]
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river



[Verse 1]
Whoa, thought it was a nightmare, low, it's all so true
They told me, don't go walking slow, the devil's on the loose

[Chorus]
Better run through the jungle[x3]
Don't look back to see

[Verse 2]
Thought I heard a rumbling, calling to my name
Two hundred million guns are loaded, Satan cries, "Take aim"

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Over on the mountain, thunder magic spoke
"Let the people know my wisdom, fill the land with smoke"

[Chorus]



[Chorus]
Oh, Susie Q, oh, Susie Q
Oh, Susie Q, baby I love you, Susie Q

[Verse]
I like the way you walk
I like the way you talk
I like the way you walk I like the way you talk, Susie Q
Well, say that you'll be true
Well, say that you'll be true
Well, say that you'll be true and never leave me blue, Susie Q
Well, say that you'll be mine
Well, say that you'll be mine
Well, say that you'll be mine, baby all the time, Susie Q

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I like the way you walk [x2]
I like the way you walk i like the way you talk, Susie Q

[Chorus]



[Verse 1]
Was Riding along side the highway
Rolling up the country side
Thinking I'm the devil's heat wave
What you burn in your crazy mind?
Saw a slight distraction standing by the road
She was smiling there, yellow in her hair
Do you want to, I was thinking
Would you care

[Chorus]
Sweet Hitch-a-Hiker
We could make music at the Greasy King
Sweet Hitch-a-Hiker
Won't you ride on my fast machine?

[Verse 2]
Cruising on thru the junction
I'm flying 'bout the speed of sound
Noticing peculiar function
I ain't no roller coaster show me down
I turned away to see her
Woa! she caught my eye
But I was rolling down, moving too fast
Do you want to
She was thinking can it last

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Was busted up along the highway
I'm the saddest riding fool alive
Wondering if you're going in my way
Won't you give a poor boy a ride?
Here she comes a riding
Lord, She's flying high
But she was rolling down, moving too fast
Do you wan to
She was thinking can I last

[Chorus][3x]



[Verse 1]
Well, you wake up in the mornin', you hear the work bell ring
And they march you to the table to see the same old thing
Ain't no food upon the table, and no pork up in the pan
But you better not complain, boy, you get in trouble with the man

[Chorus:]
Let the Midnight Special shine a light on me
Let the Midnight Special shine a light on me
Let the Midnight Special shine a light on me
Let the Midnight Special shine a ever loving light on me

[Verse 2]
Yonder come miss Rosie, how in the world did you know?
By the way she wears her apron, and the clothes she wore
Umbrella on her shoulder, piece of paper in her hand
She come to see the gov'nor, she wants to free her man

[Chorus]
Let the Midnight Special shine a light on me
Let the Midnight Special shine a light on me
Let the Midnight Special shine a light on me
Let the Midnight Special shine a ever loving light on me

[Verse 3]
If you're ever in Houston, well, you better do the right
You better not gamble, there, you better not fight, at all
Or the sheriff will grab you and the boys will bring you down
The next thing you know, boy, Oh! You're prison bound

[Chorus]
Let the Midnight Special shine a light on me
Let the Midnight Special shine a light on me
Let the Midnight Special shine a light on me
Let the Midnight Special shine a ever loving light on me

[Verse 1]
There's a place up ahead and I'm going
Just as fast as my feet can fly
Come away, come away if you're going
Leave the sinkin' ship behind
Ooooh!

[Chorus]
Come on the rising wind
We're going up around the bend

[Verse 2]
Bring a song and a smile for the banjo
Better get while the getting's good
Hitch a ride to the end of the highway
Where the neons turn to wood

[Chorus]
Come on the rising wind
We're going up around the bend
Ooooh!

[Verse 3]
You can ponder perpetual motion
Fix your mind on a crystal day
Always time for good conversation
There's an ear for what you say

[Chorus]
Come on the rising wind
We're going up around the bend
Yeeaahhh!

Ooooh!

[Verse 4]
Catch a ride to the end of the highway
And we'll meet by the big red tree
There's a place up ahead and I'm going
Come along, come along with me

[Chorus]
Come on the rising wind
We're going up around the bend
Yeeaahhh!



[Verse 1: Creedence Clearwater Revival]
Long as I remember, the rain been coming down
Clouds of mystery pouring, confusion on the ground
Good men through the ages, trying to find the sun

[Chorus: Creedence Clearwater Revival]
And I wonder, still I wonder, who'll stop the rain

[Verse 2: Creedence Clearwater Revival]
I went down Virginia, seeking shelter from the storm
Caught up in the fable, I watched the tower grow
Five year plans and new deals, wrapped in golden chains

[Chorus: Creedence Clearwater Revival]
And I wonder, still I wonder, who'll stop the rain

[Verse 3: Creedence Clearwater Revival]
Heard the singers playing, how we cheered for more
The crowd had rushed together, trying to keep warm
Still the rain kept pouring, falling on my ears

[Chorus: Creedence Clearwater Revival]
And I wonder, still I wonder, who'll stop the rain



Fire woman, yeah

Shake, shake, shake, shake it, yeah

Wound up, can't sleep, can't do anything right, little honey
Oh, since I set my eyes on you
I tell you the truth
T-t-t-t-twistin' like a flame in a slow dance, baby
You're driving me crazy
Come on, little honey
Come on now

Fire
Smoke, she is a rising fire, yeah
Smoke on the horizon, well
Fire
Smoke, she is a rising fire
Oh, smokestack lightning
Smokestack lightning

Well, shake it up, you're to blame, got me swayin' little honey
My heart's a ball of burnin' flame
Oh, yes it is
Prancing like a cat on a hot tin shack
Lord, have mercy
Come on little sister
Come on and shake it

Fire
Smoke, she is a rising fire
Oh, smoke on the horizon, yeah
Fire
Smoke, she is a rising fire
Oh, smokestack lightning, baby

I was thinking
What I've been missing
I'll tell you truthfully, well
She's coming close now
Oh, I can feel her
She's getting close to me
And I never, yeah

Fire
Smoke, she is a rising fire
Oh, smoke on the horizon
Fire
Smoke, she is a rising, rising, rising fire
Smokestack lightning
A-j-j-j...

Burnin' out
And shake it, baby
Come on and burn it

I say send down fire to me
Say send down fire to me
Say send down fire to me, yeah!

Fire woman, you're to blame...
Fire woman, you're to blame...
Fire woman, you're to blame...
Fire woman, you're to blame...



Helplessly hoping
Her harlequin hovers nearby
Awaiting a word
Grasping at glimpses
Of gentle true spirit
He runs, wishing he could fly
Only to trip at the sound of good-bye

Wordlessly watching
He waits by the window
And wonders
At the empty place inside
Heartlessly helping himself to her bad dreams
He worries
Did he hear a good-bye? Or even hello?

They are one person
They are two alone
They are three together
They are four for each other

Stand by the stairway
You'll see something
Certain to tell you confusion has its cost
Love isn't lying
It's loose in a lady who lingers
Saying she is lost
And choking on hello

They are one person
They are two alone
They are three together
They are four for each other



It's been a long time comin'
It's goin' to be a long time gone

And it appears to be a long
Appears to be a long
Appears to be a long time
Yes, a long, long, long, long time before the dawn

Turn, turn any corner
Hear, you must hear what the people say
You know there's something that's goin' on around here
That surely, surely, surely won't stand the light of day, no

And it appears to be a long (yes it does)
Appears to be a long (mm)
Appears to be a long time
Such a long, long time before the dawn

Speak out, you got to speak out against the madness
You got to speak your mind, if you dare
But don't—no, don't no—try to get yourself elected
If you do you had better cut your hair, mm

And it appears to be a long (yes it does)
Appears to be a long (mm)
Appears to be a long time
Such a long, long, long, long time before the dawn

It's been a (long) long (time) time (comin') comin'
It's going to be (long) a long (time) time (gone) gone
But you know the darkest hour
Is always, always just before the dawn

And it appears to be a long
Appears to be a long
Appears to be a long time
Such a long, long, long, long time before the dawn



[Verse 1]
Got out of town on a boat, going to Southern islands
Sailing a reach before a following sea
She was making for the trades on the outside
And the downhill run to Papeete
Off the wind on this heading lie the Marquesas
We got eighty feet of the waterline, nicely making way
In a noisy bar in Avalon, I tried to call you
But on a midnight watch I realized why twice you ran away

[Pre-Chorus]
Think about how many times I have fallen
Spirits are using me, larger voices calling
What heaven brought you and me cannot be forgotten

[Chorus]
I have been around the world
Looking for that woman-girl
Who knows love can endure
And you know it will

[Verse 2]
When you see the Southern Cross for the first time
You understand now why you came this way
Cause the truth you might be running from is so small
But it's as big as the promise, the promise of a coming day
So I'm sailing for tomorrow, my dreams are a dying
And my love is an anchor tied to you, tied with a silver chain
I have my ship and all her flags are a flying
She is all that I have left and music is her name

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
So we cheated and we lied and we tested
And we never failed to fail, it was the easiest thing to do
You will survive being bested
Somebody fine will come along, make me forget about loving you
In the Southern Cross



Part 1

It's getting to the point
Where I am no fun anymore
I am sorry
Sometimes it hurts so badly I must cry out loud
'I am lonely.'
I am yours, you are mine
You are what you are
You make it hard

Remember what we've said
And done and felt about each other
Oh babe, have mercy
Don't let the past
Remind us of what we are not now
I am not dreaming
I am yours, you are mine
You are what you are
You make it hard

{Bridge}

Tearing yourself away from me now
You are free
And I am crying
This does not mean I don't love you
I do, that's forever
Yes and for always
I am yours, you are mine
You are what you are
You make it hard

Something inside is telling me
That I've got your secret
Are you still listening?
Fear is the lock and laughter the key
To your heart
And I love you
I am yours, you are mine
You are what you are
And you make it hard
And you make it hard
And you make it hard
And you make it hard

Part 2

Friday evening, Sunday in the afternoon
What have you got to lose?
Tuesday morning, please be gone, I'm tired of you
What have you got to lose?
Can I tell it like it is?
Listen to me baby-
It's my heart that's suffering
It's a-dying-
And that's what I have to lose

I've got an answer
I'm going to fly away
What have I got to lose?
Will you come see me Thursdays and Saturdays?
What have you got to lose?

{Bridge}

Part 3

Chestnut brown canary
Ruby throated sparrow
Sing a song, don't be long
Thrill me to the marrow
Voices of the angels
Ring around the moonlight
Asking me, said she's so free
How can you catch the sparrow?
Lacy, lilting lyrics, losing love lamenting
Change my life, make it right
Be my lady

Part 4 - {Coda}

¡Que linda! Me la traiga a Cuba
La reina de la Mar Caribe
Quiero sólo visitarla allí
Y que triste que no puedo. ¡Vaya!
O Va! O Va!



One morning I woke up and I knew
You were really gone
A new day, a new way, I knew
I should see it along
Go your way, I'll go mine
And carry on

The sky is clearing and the night
Has gone out
The sun, he come, the world
Is all full of love
Rejoice, rejoice, we have no choice
But to carry on

The fortunes of fables are able
To sing the song
Now witness the quickness with which
We get along
To sing the blues you've got to live the dues
And carry on

Carry on
Love is coming
Love is coming to us all

Where are you going now, my love?
Where will you be tomorrow?
Will you bring me happiness?
Will you bring me sorrow?

Oh, the questions of a thousand dreams
What you do with what you see
Lover, can you talk to me?

Girl, when I was on my own
Chasing you down
What was it made you run?
Trying your best just to get around

The questions of a thousand dreams
What you do and what you see
Lover, can you talk to me?



[Hook]
Tin soldiers and Nixon's comin'
We're finally on our own
This summer I hear the drummin'
Four dead in Ohio

[Verse 1]
Gotta get down to it
Soldiers are gunning us down
Should have been done long ago
What if you knew her and
Found her dead on the ground?
How can you run when you know?

[Bridge]
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

[Verse 2]
Gotta get down to it
Soldiers are cutting us down
Should have been done long ago
What if you knew her and
Found her dead on the ground?
How can you run when you know?

[Hook]

[Outro]
Four dead in Ohio (Whoa!)
Four dead in Ohio (four)
Four dead in Ohio (Ah!)
Four dead in Ohio (How many more?)
Four dead in Ohio (What?)
Four dead in Ohio (Oh!)
Four dead in Ohio (Oh!)
Four dead in Ohio (What?)
Four dead in Ohio (Ah)
Four dead in Ohio



Well, I came upon a child of God
He was walking along the road
And I asked him, "tell me, where are you going?"
This he told me

Said, "I'm going down to Yasgur's Farm
Gonna join in a rock and roll band
Got to get back to the land
And set my soul free"

We are stardust, we are golden
We are billion-year-old carbon
And we've got to get ourselves
Back to the garden

Well, then can I walk beside you?
I have come to lose the smog
And I feel myself a cog
In somethin' turning

And maybe it's the time of year
Yes, and maybe it's the time of man
And I don't know who I am
But life is for learning

We are stardust, we are golden
We are billion-year-old carbon
And we got to get ourselves
Back to the garden

We are stardust, we are golden
We are billion-year-old carbon
And we got to get ourselves
Back to the garden

By the time we got to Woodstock
We were half a million strong
And everywhere was a song
And a celebration

And I dreamed I saw the bomber jet planes
Riding shotgun in the sky
Turning into butterflies
Above our nation

We are stardust, we are golden
We are caught in the devil's bargain
And we got to get ourselves
Back to the garden



[Intro]
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

[Verse 1]
I keep looking for something I can't get
Broken hearts lie all around me
And I don't see an easy way to get out of this
Her diary it sits on the bedside table
The curtains are closed, the cats in the cradle
Who would've thought that a boy like me could come to this

[Hook]
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of genius
I should've walked away, I should've walked away

[Verse 2]
Is there any just cause for feeling like this?
On the surface I'm a name on a list
I try to be discreet, but then blow it again
I've lost and found, it's my final mistake
She's loving by proxy, no give and all take
Cause I've been thrilled to fantasy one too many times

Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

[Hook]
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must been some kind of genius
I should've walked away, I should've walked away
It was a long hot night
She made it easy, she made it feel right
But now it's over the moment has gone
I followed my hands not my head, I know I was wrong

Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must been some kind of genius
I should've walked away, I should've walked away



I don't wanna hear about it anymore
It's a shame I've got to live without you anymore
There's a fire in my heart
A pounding in my brain
It's driving me crazy

We don't need to talk about it anymore
Yesterday's just a memory
Can we close the door

I just made one mistake
I didn't know what to say
When you called me baby

Don't say goodnight
Say you're gonna stay forever
Oh, whoa, all the way

Can you take me high enough
To fly me over (fly me over) yesterday
Can you take me high enough
It's never over
Yesterday's just a memory
(Yesterday's just a memory and)

I don't want to live without you anymore
Can't you see I'm in misery
And you know for sure
I would live and die for you
And I'd know just what to do when you call me baby

Don't say goodbye
Say you're gonna stay forever
Oh, whoa, all the way

Can you take me high enough
Can you fly me over (fly me over) yesterday
Can you take me high enough
It's never over
Yesterday's just a memory

I'm running
I was running for the door
The next thing I remember
I was running back for more, yeah

Don't say goodbye
Say you're gonna stay forever
Oh, whoa, all the way (all the way, all the way, yeah)

Can you take me high enough
Can you fly me over (fly me over) yesterday
Can you take me high enough
It's never over, whoa, whoa, whoa

Can you take me high enough
Won't you fly me over (won't you fly me over) yesterday
Can you take me high enough
It's never over, whoa, whoa, whoa



You went away and left long time ago
Now your knocking on my door
I hear you knocking
But you can't come in
I hear you knocking
Go back where you been

I begged you not to go but you said goodbye
Now your telling me all your lies
I hear you knocking
But you can't come in
I hear you knocking
Go back where you been

[?]

You better get back to your used to be
Cause your kind of love ain't good for me
I hear you knocking
But you can't come in
I hear you knocking
Go back where you been

I told you way back in '52
That I would never go with you
I hear you knocking
But you can't come in
I hear you knocking
Go back where you been



He seeks and he hides
He lives and he dies
He saw it before we were dreaming
He'll hustle you down
A tin can or a crown
But he'll never play with your feelings

Headkeeper's the name
He's been here since he came
And he's keeping ahead of the meaning

He's weak and he's brave
He'll make you a slave
Or free you to fly in the heaven
With thoughts that are pure
He'll reflect all you saw
And all that is just an illusion

Don't you know the feeling
Don't you know the truth
Don't you know your dreaming
Don't you know it's you
Don't you know it's you

Headkeeper's the name
He's been here since he came
And he's keeping ahead of the meaning



Only you know and I know
All the lovin' we've got to show
So don't refuse to believe it
By reading too many meanings

'Cause you know that I mean what I say
So don't go, and never take me the wrong way
You know you can't go on gettin' your own way
'Cause if you do, it's gonna get you someday

We're both here to be pleasin'
Oh, no, no, not deceivin'
But it's hard to believe in
Ah yeah, when you've been so mistreated

'Cause you know that I mean what I say
So don't go, and never take me the wrong way
You know you can't go on gettin' your own way
'Cause if you do, it's gonna get you someday

If I seem to mislead you
It's just my craziness comin' through
But when it comes down to just two
Ah, I ain't no crazier than you

'Cause you know that I mean what I say
So don't go, and never take me the wrong way
You know you can't go on gettin' your own way
'Cause if you do, it's gonna get you someday

Only you know and I know
Only you know and I know
Only you know and I know, oh yeah
Only you know and I know, oh yeah, get up



Been away, haven't seen you in a while
How've you been, have you changed your style?
And do you think that we've grown up differently?
Don't seem the same, seems you've lost your feel for me

So let's leave it alone, 'cause we can't see eye to eye
There ain't no good guy, there ain't no bad guy
There's only you and me and we just disagree
Ooh-hoo-hoo, oh-oh-ho

I'm going back to a place that's far away
How bout you, have you got a place to stay?
Why should I care when I'm just trying to get along?
We were friends, but now it's the end of our love song

So let's leave it alone, 'cause we can't see eye to eye
There ain't no good guy, there ain't no bad guy
There's only you and me and we just disagree
Ooh-hoo-hoo, oh-oh-ho

So let's leave it alone, 'cause we can't see eye to eye
There ain't no good guy, there ain't no bad guy
There's only you and me and we just disagree
Ooh-hoo-hoo, oh, oh-oh-ho



Miss Cristina drives a 944
Satisfaction oozes from her pores
She keeps rings on her fingers
Marble on her floor
Cocaine in her dresser
Bars on her doors
She keeps her back against the wall
She keeps her back against the wall

So I say
I say welcome
Welcome to the boomtown
Pick a habit
We got plenty to go around

Welcome
Welcome to the boomtown
All that money makes
Such a succulent sound
Welcome to the boomtown

Handsome Kevin
Got a little off track
Took a year off from college
And he never went back

Now he smokes much too much
Got a permanent hack
Deals dope out of Denny's
Keeps a table in the back
He always listens to low ground
Always listens to low ground

So I say
I say welcome
Welcome to the boomtown
Pick a habit
We got plenty to go around

Welcome
Welcome to the boomtown
All that money makes
Such a succulent sound
Welcome to the boomtown

Well, the ambulance arrived too late
I guess she didn't want to wait

So I say
I say welcome
Welcome to the boomtown
Pick a habit
We got plenty to go around

Welcome
Welcome to the boomtown
All that money makes
Such a succulent sound
Welcome to the boomtown

Welcome to the boomtown
Welcome to the boomtown



I'm moving through some changes
I'll never be the same
Something you did touched me
There's no one else to blame

The love we had has fallen
The love we used to share
We've given up pretending
As if you didn't care

Change, changing places
Root yourself to the ground
Capitalize on this good fortune
One word can bring you round
Changes

I look into the mirror
I see no happiness
All the warmth that I gave you
Has turned to emptiness

The love we had has fallen
The love we used to share
You've left me here believing
In love that wasn't there

Change, changing places
Root yourself to the ground
Word to the wise
Well, you get what's coming
One word can bring you round
Changes

But when I look into your eyes
And try to find out how
There's no way to save it now
And everything I feel

Changes
Keep looking for
Changes, changes

For some reason you're questioning why
I always believe it gets better
One difference between you and I
Your heart is inside your head

One word from you, one word from me
A clear design on your liberty
Who could believe when love has gone
How we move on like everyone

Only such fools
Only such jealous hearts
Only through love changes come

Change, changing places
Root yourself to the ground
Capitalize on this good fortune
One word can bring you round
Changes

One road to loneliness
It's always the same
One road to happiness
It's calling your name

Change, changing places, changes
Root yourself to the ground
Capitalize on this good fortune
One word can bring you round
Changes

Change, changing places, changes
Root yourself to the ground
Word to the wise
Well, you get what's coming
One word, one word can bring you round
Changes



[Intro]
Oh, Little China Girl
Oh, Little China Girl

[Chorus 1]
I could escape this feeling with my China Girl
I feel a wreck without my little China Girl
I hear her heart beating loud as thunder
Saw the stars crashing

[Chorus 1]
I'm a mess without my little China Girl
Wake up in the morning wheres my little China Girl?
I hear hearts beating loud as thunder
I saw the stars crashing down

[Verse 1]
I'm feeling tragic like I'm Marlon Brando
When I look at my China Girl
I could pretend that nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China Girl
I stumble into town just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head
Plans for everyone
Its in the white of my eyes

[Bridge]
My little china girl
You shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything you are
I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give you a man who wants to rule the world

[Chorus 2]
And when I get excited
My little China Girl says
Oh baby, Just you shut your mouth
She says ... sh
She says
She says

[Chorus 2]
And when I get excited
My little China Girl says
Oh baby, Just you shut your mouth
She says ... shhhhhhh
She says
She says

[Outro]
Oh, Little China Girl[x4]



[Verse 1]
As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicone hump and your ten inch stump
Dressed like a priest you was
Tod Browning's Freak you was
Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee
I'm sure you're not protected, for it's plain to see
The Diamond Dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will, mannequins with kill appeal

[Chorus]
(Will they come?)
I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?)
Oh baby, come on to me
(Will they come?)
Well, she's come, been and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs

[Verse 2]
The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
The elevator's broke, so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below, oh Tarzan, go man go
Meet his little hussy with his ghost town approach
Her face is sans feature, but she wears a Dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake
Wrecked up and paralysed, Diamond Dogs are stabilised

[Chorus]
(Will they come?)
I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?)
Oh baby, come on to me
(Will they come?)
Well, she's come, been and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Call them the diamond dogs
Call them the diamond dogs

[Verse 3]
In the year of the scavenger, the season of the bitch
Sashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the ditch
Just another future song, lonely little kitsch
(There's gonna be sorrow) try and wake up tomorrow

[Chorus]
(Will they come?)
I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?)
Oh baby, come on to me
(Will they come?)
Well, she's come, been and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dog

[Outro]
Oo-oo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Oo-oo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Bow-wow, woof woof, bow-wow, wow
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Dogs
Call them the Diamond Dogs, call them, call them
Call them the Diamond Dogs, call them, call them, ooo
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Keep cool
Diamond Dogs rule, OK
Hey-hey-hey-hey
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond Dogs

Feeling so gay, feeling gay



[Verse 1]
There's a brand new dance
But I don't know its name
That people from bad homes
Do again and again
It's big and it's bland
Full of tension and fear
They do it over there but we don't do it here

[Pre-Chorus]
Fashion! Turn to the left
Fashion! Turn to the right
Oooh, fashion!
We are the goon squad
And we're coming to town
Beep-beep
Beep-beep

[Chorus]
Listen to me - don't listen to me
Talk to me - don't talk to me
Dance with me - don't dance with me, no
Beep-beep

[Verse 2]
There's a brand new talk
But it's not very clear
That people from good homes
Are talking this year
It's loud and tasteless
And I've heard it before
You shout it while you're dancing
On the whole dance floor
Oh bop, fashion

[Pre-Chorus]
Fashion! Turn to the left
Fashion! Turn to the right
Oooh, fashion!
We are the goon squad
And we're coming to town
Beep-beep
Beep-beep

[Chorus]
Listen to me - don't listen to me
Talk to me - don't talk to me
Dance with me - don't dance with me, no
Beep-beep

[Outro]
Oh, bop, do do do do do do do do
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fashion
Oh, bop, do do do do do do do do
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fashion
La-la la la la la la-la



[Verse 1]
Monday morning feels so bad
Everybody seems to nag me
Coming Tuesday I feel better
Even my old man looks good
Wednesday just do not go
Thursday goes too slow
I have got Friday on my mind

[Chorus]
(See my baby)
Going to have fun in the city
(feel like fucking you)
(Do my baby screw)
Be with my girl
She is so pretty
(all I want to do)
(I will go crazy)
She looks fine tonight
(zoom zoom zoom)
She is out of sight to me (so divine)
(Tonight) I spend my bread
(Tonight) I lose my head
(Tonight) I have got to get tonight
Monday I have Friday on my mind

Do the five day drag once more (Monday blue)

[Verse 2]
There is nothing else that bugs me
More than working for the rich men (poor man, beggar
Man, thief)
Hey I will change that scene one day
Today I might be mad
Tomorrow I will be glad
'Cause I will have Friday on my mind

[Chorus]
(See my baby) (feel like fucking you)
Gonna have fun
(zoom zoom zoom)
Be with my girl [repeat ad lib.]



[Refrain]
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop

[Verse 1]
Don't let me hear you say
Life's taking you nowhere, angel
(Come get up, my baby)
Look at that sky, life's begun
Nights are warm and the days are young
(Come get up, my baby)

[Chorus 1]
There's my baby, lost that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Come get up, my baby

[Verse 2]
Last night they loved you
Opening doors and pulling some strings, angel
(Come get up, my baby)
In walked luck and you looked in time
Never look back, walk tall, act fine
(Come get up, my baby)

[Chorus 2]
I'll stick with you baby for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years
Golden years
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Come get up, my baby

[Verse 3]
Some of these days, and it won't be long
Gonna drive back down where you once belonged
In the back of a dream car twenty foot long
(Come get up, my baby)
Don't cry my sweet, don't break my heart
Doing all right, but you gotta get smart
Wish upon, wish upon, day upon day
I believe, oh Lord, I believe all the way
(Come get up, my baby)
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years

[Chorus 1]
There's my baby, lost that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Come get up, my baby

[Bridge]
Don't let me hear you say life's taking you nowhere, angel
(Come get up, my baby)
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years

[Chorus 2]
I'll stick with you baby for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years
Golden years
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop



[Chorus]
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing, will drive them away
We can beat them, just for one day
We can be heroes, just for one day

[Verse 1]
And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes we're lovers, and that is that

[Refrain]
Though nothing, will keep us together
We could steal time, just for one day
We can be heroes, forever and ever
What d'you say?

[Verse 2]
I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim

[Refrain]
Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them, forever and ever
Oh we can be heroes, just for one day

[Chorus]
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing, will drive them away
We can be heroes, just for one day
We can be us, just for one day

[Verse 3]
I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing, by the wall (by the wall)
And the guns, shot above our heads (over our heads)
And we kissed, as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)

[Refrain]
And the shame, was on the other side
Oh we can beat them, forever and ever
Then we could be heroes, just for one day
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes, just for one day
We can be heroes

[Outro]
We're nothing, and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer, just for one day
Oh-oh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-oh-ohh, just for one day



{Intro}

A small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers and slash back blazers and
Ate all your razors while pulling the waiters
Talking 'bout Monroe and walking on Snow White
New York's a go-go, and everything tastes nice
Poor little Greenie

("Get back one")

The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie) he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go

{Bridge}

Sits like a man, but he smiles like a reptile
She loves him, she loves him, but just for a short while
She'll scratch in the sand, won't let go his hand
He says he's a beautician and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie

The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie) he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go

{Bridge}

He's so simple minded, he can't drive his module
He bites on the neon and sleeps in the capsule
Loves to be loved
Loves to be loved

{Long bridge}

The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie) he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go

Go, go

The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie) he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go

Go
Go, go

{Outro}

[Verse 1]
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
(Let's dance)
To the song they're playing on the radio
(Let's sway)
While colour lights up your face
(Let's sway)
Sway through the crowd to an empty space

[Chorus]
If you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you
Would break my heart in two
If you should fall, into my arms
And tremble like a flower

[Verse 2]
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
For fear your grace should fall
(Let's dance)
For fear tonight is all
(Let's sway)
You could look into my eyes
(Let's sway)
Under the moonlight, this serious moonlight

[Chorus]
And if you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you
Would break my heart in two
If you should fall, into my arms
And tremble like a flower

[Verse 3]
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
(Let's dance)
To the song we're playing
(Let's sway)

Under the moonlight, this serious moonlight

[Outro]
(Let's dance)

Let's dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance

[Intro]

I know when to go out
And when to stay in
Get things done
I catch a paper boy
But things don't really change
I'm standing in the wind
But I never wave bye-bye
But I try
I try
There's no sign of life
It's just the power to charm
I'm lying in the rain
But I never wave bye-bye

But I try
I try

[Chorus]
Never going to fall for
(Modern Love)
Walks beside me
(Modern Love)
Walks on by
(Modern Love)
Gets me to the Church on Time
(Church on Time)
Terrifies me
(Church on Time)
Makes me party
(Church on Time)
Puts my trust in God and Man
(God and Man)
No confessions!
(God and Man)
No religion
(God and Man)
Don't believe
In Modern Love

[Bridge]
It's not really work
It's just the power to charm
I'm still standing in the wind
But I never wave bye bye

But I try
I try

[Chorus]
Never going to fall for
(Modern Love)
Walks beside me
(Modern Love)
Walks on by
(Modern Love)
Gets me to the Church on Time
(Church on Time)
Terrifies me
(Church on Time)
Makes me party
(Church on Time)
Puts my trust in God and Man
(God and Man)
No confessions!
(God and Man)
No religion
(God and Man)
Don't believe
In Modern Love

[Outro]
Modern love - Modern love - Modern love - Modern love
Modern love - Modern love - Modern love - Modern love
- Modern love - Modern love - Modern love - Modern love
Modern love -  Walks beside me, Modern love
Modern love -  Walks on by, Modern love
Modern love -  Walks beside me, Modern love
Modern love -  Walks on by, Modern love



[Verse 1]
He looked a lot like Che Guevara
Drove a diesel van
Kept his gun in quiet seclusion
Such a humble man
The only survivor of the National People's Gang

[Chorus]
Panic in Detroit
I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home
I wish someone would phone

Panic in Detroit

[Verse 2]
He laughed at accidental sirens
That broke the evening gloom
The police had warned of repercussions
They followed none too soon
A trickle of strangers were all that were left alive

[Chorus]
Panic in Detroit
I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home
I wish someone would phone

Panic in Detroit

[Verse 3]
Putting on some clothes I made my way to school
And I found my teacher
Crouching in his overalls
I screamed and ran to smash my favorite slot machine
And jumped the silent cars that slept at traffic lights

{Bridge}
Having scored a trillion dollars
Made a run back home

Found him slumped across the table
A gun and me alone
I ran to the window. Looked for a plane or two
Panic in Detroit
He'd left me an autograph
"Let me collect dust."
I wish someone would phone

Panic in Detroit

Panic in Detroit

{Outro}



{Intro}

Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo

You've got your mother in a whirl
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let's go out tonight
You like me, and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on

Rebel Rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel Rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel Rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so!

{Bridge}

Don't ya?
Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo

You've got your mother in a whirl cause she's
Not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let's stay out tonight
You like me, and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on

Rebel Rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel Rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel Rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so!

Don't ya?
Oh?
Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo

Rebel Rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel Rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel Rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so!

{Bridge}

You've torn your dress, your face is a mess
You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test
You've got your transmission and your live wire
You got your cue line and a handful of ludes
You wanna be there when they count up the dudes
And I love your dress
You're a juvenile success
Because your face is a mess
So how could they know?
I said, how could they know?

So what you wanna know
Calamity's child, chi-chi, chi-chi
Where'd you wanna go?
What can I do for you? Looks like you've been there too
Cause you've torn your dress
And your face is a mess
Ooo, your face is a mess
Ooo, ooo, so how could they know?
Eh, eh, how could they know?
Eh, eh



[Instrumental intro]

[Verse 1]
Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills
And put your helmet on
(10) Ground Control (9) to Major Tom (8)
(7, 6) Commencing (5) countdown
Engines on (4, 3, 2)
Check ignition (1)
And may God's love (Liftoff) be with you

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirt you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today

[Chorus]
For here am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

[Verse 3]
Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much
She knows
Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you....

[Chorus]
Here am I floating 'round my tin can
Far above the Moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

[Instrumental outro]



[Intro]
Hey my love
Goodbye love

[Verse 1]
Didn't know what time it was the lights were low
I leaned back on my radio
Some cat was layin down some rock n roll lotta soul, he said
Then the loud sound did seem to fade
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
That weren't no DJ that was hazy cosmic jive

[Chorus]
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

[Verse 2]
I had to phone someone so I picked on you
Hey, that's far out so you heard him too!
Switch on the TV we may pick him up on channel two
Look out your window I can see his light
If we can sparkle he may land tonight
Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright

[Chorus]
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie
Starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie



[Verse 1]
This week dragged past me so slowly
The days fell on their knees
Maybe I'll take something to help me
Hope someone takes after me
I guess there's always some change in the weather
This time I know we could
Get it together
If I did casually mention tonight
That would be crazy tonight

[Chorus]
Stay - that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is
Stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time
Because you can never really tell
When somebody wants something you want too

[Verse 2]
Heart wrecker, heart wrecker
Make me delight
Life is so vague when it brings someone new
This time tomorrow I'll know what to do
I know it's happened to you

[Chorus]
Stay - that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is
Stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time
Because you can never really tell
When somebody wants something or wants to
Stay - that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is
Stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time
Because you can never really tell
When somebody wants something you want too



[Verse 1]
Hey man, oh leave me alone you know
Hey man, oh Henry, get off the phone, I gotta
Hey man, I gotta straighten my face
This mellow thighed chick just put my spine out of place
Hey man, my schooldays insane
Hey man, my work's down the drain
Hey man, well she's a total blam-blam
She said she had to squeeze it but she... then she...

[Chorus]
Oh don't lean on me man
Cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh don't lean on me man
Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight...she's all right

[Verse 2]
Hey man, Henry, don't be unkind, go away
Hey man, I can't take you this time, no way
Hey man, droogie don't crash here
There's only room for one and here she comes, here she comes

[Chorus]
Oh don't lean on me man
Cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh don't lean on me man
Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight...she's all right
Oh don't lean on me man
Cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh don't lean on me man
Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight...she's all right

[Outro]
A Suffragette City, a Suffragette City
I'm back on Suffragette City, I'm back on Suffragette City
Ooo, Suffraggete city, ooo, Suffragette City
Oooh-how, Suffragette City, oooh-how, Suffragette City, oooh-how
Suffragette
Ohhh, wham bam, thank you Ma'am!
A Suffragette City, a Suffragette City
Quite all right
A Suffragette City
Too fine
A Suffragette City, ooh, a Suffragette City
Oh, my Suffragette City, oh my Suffragette City
Oh, Suffragette
Suffragette!



[Verse 1]
They pulled in just behind the bridge
He lays her down, he frowns
Gee my life's a funny thing, am I
Still too young?
He kissed her then and there
She took his ring, took his babies
It took him minutes, took her nowhere
Heaven knows, she'd have taken anything, but

[Chorus]
All night
She wants the young American
Young American, young American, she wants the
Young American
All right
She wants the young American

[Verse 2]
Scanning life through the picture window (uhuh)
She finds the slinky vagabond
He coughs as he passes her Ford Mustang
But Heaven forbid, she'll take anything
But the freak, and his type, all for nothing
He misses a step and cuts his hand, but
Showing nothing, he swoops like a song
She cries Where have all Papa's heroes gone?

[Chorus]
All night
She wants the young American
Young American, young American, she wants the
Young American
All right
She wants the young American

[Bridge]
All the way from Washington
Her bread-winner begs off the bathroom floor
We live for just these twenty years
Do we have to die for the fifty more?"

[Chorus]
All night
He wants the young American
Young American, young American
He wants the young American
All right
He wants the young American

[Verse 3]
Do you remember, your President Nixon? (huuhu)
Do you remember, the bills you have to pay?
Or even yesterday?
Have been the un-American?  (huuhu)
Just you and your idol sing falsetto  (huuhu)
'bout Leather, leather everywhere, and
Not a myth left from the ghetto
Well, well, well, would you carry a razor  (huuhu)
In case, just in case of depression? (huuhu)
Sit on your hands on a bus of survivors
Blushing at all the Afro-Sheeners
Ain't that close to love?
Well, ain't that poster love?
Well, it ain't that Barbie doll
Her hearts have been broken just like you and

[Chorus]
All night
(All night )You want the young American
Young American, young American, you want the
Young American
All right
You want the young American

[Verse 4]
You ain't a pimp and you ain't a hustler
A pimp's got a Cadi and a lady got a Chrysler
Black's got respect, and white's got his soul train
Mama's got cramps, and look at your hands ache
(I heard the news today, oh boy)
I got a suite and you got defeat
Ain't there a man who can say no more?
And, ain't there a woman I can
Sock on the jaw?
And, ain't there a child I can hold without judging?
Ain't there a pen that will write before they die?
Ain't you proud that you've still got faces?
Ain't there one damn song that can make me
Break down and cry?

[Chorus]
All night
I want the young American
Young American, young American, I want the young American
All right
I want the young American
Young American
Young American, young American, I want the young American
All night
You and I
I want you
I
Young American, young American, I want the young American
All right
I want the young American
Young American, young American, I want the young American
All night



[Verse 1]
Oh yeah
Now Ziggy played guitar
Jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And The Spiders from Mars
He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man
Then we were Ziggy's Band

[Verse 2]
Ziggy really sang
Screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
Oh he could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
He came on so loaded man,
Well hung, snow white tan

[Chorus 1]
So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our balls?
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?

[Verse 3]
Oh yeah
Ziggy played for time
Jiving us that we were Voodoo
The kids was just crass
He was the naz
With God-given ass
He took it all too far
But boy could he play guitar

[Chorus 2]
Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed a man
I had to break up the band
Oh yeah
Oooh
Oh hohoo

[Outro]
Ziggy played guitar



[Verse 1]
Hey kid, rock and roll
Rock on, ooh, my soul
Hey kid, boogey too, did ya
Hey shout, summertime blues
Jump up and down in them blue suede shoes
Hey kid, rock and roll, rock on

[Bridge]
And where do we go from here
Which is the way that's clear

[Verse 2]
Still looking for that blue jean, baby queen
Prettiest girl I ever seen
See her shake on the movie screen, Jimmy Dean
James Dean

[Bridge]
And where do we go from here
Which is the way that's clear

[Verse 3]
Still looking for that blue jean, baby queen
Prettiest girl I ever seen
See her shake on the movie screen, Jimmy Dean
Jimmy Dean
Rock on
Rock on
Rock on

[Verse 4]
Hey kid
Rock and roll
Rock on

[Hook]
Rock on
Hey, hey
Rock and roll
Rock on

[Hook x2]



There's no way out of here, when you come in you're in for good
There was no promise made, the part you've played, the chance you took
There are no boundaries set, the time and yet you waste it still

So it slips through your hands like grains of sand, you watch it go
There's no time to be lost, you'll pay the cost, so get it right
There's no way out of here, when you come in you're in for good

And never was there an answer, there an answer
Not without listening, without seeing

There are no answers here, when you look out you don't see in
There was no promise made, the part you've played, the chance you took
There's no way out of here, when you come in you're in for good

And never was there an answer, there an answer
Not without listening, without seeing

There's no way out of here, when you come in you're in for good
There are no answers here, when you look out you don't see in
There was no promise made, the part you've played, the chance you took

(There's no way out of here, when you come in you're in for good)
(There's no way out of here, when you come in you're in for good)
(There are no answers here, when you look out you don't see in)
(There's no way out of here, when you come in you're in for good)

(There's no way out of here, when you come in you're in for good)
(There's no way out of here...)



You call that love in French, but it's just Frenchette
I've been to France, so let's just dance
I get all the love I need in a luncheonette
In just one glance, so let's just dance
I can't get the kind of love that I want
Or that I need, so let's just dance

You come on like it's all natural darling
But you know, oh it's really only naturalette
It's just like all of your leathers darling, they don't scare me
I know it's really only leatherette
I take it down, gonna wash it down
I scrub you on down in any old launderette
I can't get the kind of love that I want
So let's just dance, and I'll forget

Want you to come in my kitchen and not my kitchenette
Want you to come in my dining room, not my dinette yet
I can't get the kind of love
So let's just dance and I'll forget

I can't get the kind of love that I want or that I need
So let's just dance
I can't get the kind of love that I want or that I need
So let's just dance

Let's just dance
Let's just dance
I said, let's just dance
Let's just dance
Let's just dance
Let's just dance

Remember how we were marveling darling, we were marvelous
Yeah we were marveling at The Marvelettes
We fell in love with Veronica
And every last one of The Ronettes
It sure got hot when Levi Stubbs
He got burned boys
Messing round with Bernadette

You call that love in French but it's just Frenchette
I've been to France, so let's just dance
I get all the love I need in a luncheonette
In just one glance, so let's just dance
I can't get the kind of love that I want
Or that I need, so let's just dance

Let's just dance
Let's just dance
Let's just dance
I said let's just dance

My doctor says to take it easy, baby
So let's just dance
My doctor said to take it easy, baby
So let's just dance
Let's just dance, baby
Let's just dance

I'm bound to take a little roll with you, honey
So let's just dance
I'm bound to take a little stroll with you, honey
So let's just dance

I said let's just dance
Well, darling, let's just dance
I said let's just dance
Come on and let's just dance

I can't get the kind of love that I want or that I need
So let's just dance



[Verse 1]
Well East coast girls are hip
I really dig those styles they wear
And the Southern girls with the way they talk
They knock me out when I'm down there

[Verse 2]
The Mid-West farmer's daughters really make you feel alright
And the Northern girls with the way they kiss
They keep their boyfriends warm at night

[Hook]
I wish they all could be California
I wish they all could be California
I wish they all could be California girls

[Verse 3]
The West coast has the sunshine
And the girls all get so tanned
I dig a french bikini on Hawaii island
Dolls by a palm tree in the sand

[Verse 4]
I been all around this great big world

I'm just a gigolo and everywhere I go
People know the part I'm playing
Paid for every dance, selling each romance
Ooh, what they say

There will come a day when youth will pass away
What will they say about me?
When the end comes, I know
It was just a gigolo
Life goes on without me

I'm just a gigolo and everywhere I go
People know the part Dave's playing
Paid for every dance, selling each romance
Ooh, what to say

They was just a gigolo
Life goes on without me, cause

Are you ready for the new sensation?
Well, here's the shot heard 'round the world
All you back room boys salute when her flag unfurls
Well, guess who's back in circulation
Now, I don't know what you may have heard
But what I need right now's the original good time girl

She's a vision from coast to coast (coast to coast)
Sea to shining sea (sea to shining sea)
Hey sister, you're the perfect host (care to toast)

Show me your bright lights
And your city lights, all right
I'm talkin' 'bout the Yankee Rose, yeah
Your bright lights
And your city lights, all right

When she walks, watch, the sparks will fly
Firecrackin' on the fourth of July
No sad songs tonight, somethin's in the air
Yeah, the feeling getcha, wow

A real state of independence
So pretty when her rockets glare
Still prove it any night that her flag's still there

She's a vision from coast to coast (coast to coast)
Sea to shining sea (sea to shining sea)
Hey sister, you're the perfect host (make a toast)

Show me your bright lights and your
City lights, all right

Ah, she's beautiful, alright

She got the beat
And here's a little bit comin' your way, wow

Aah, raise 'em up there, let's see who salutes, baby

Here's the national anthem, here
I wanna get a little bit a' apple pie, man

Bright lights, city lights
Bright lights, city lights
Bright lights, city lights



[Verse 1]
The sky is red, I don't understand
Past midnight I still see the land
People are saying the woman is damned
She makes you burn with a wave of her hand
The city's ablaze, the town's on fire
The woman's flames are reaching higher
We were fools, we called her liar
All I hear is
"Burn!"

[Verse 2]
I didn't believe she was devil's sperm
She said, "Curse you all, you'll never learn"
"When I leave there's no return"
The people laughed till she said, "Burn!"
Warning came, no one cared
Earth was shaking, we stood and stared
When it came no one was spared
Still I hear "Burn!"

[Bridge]
You know we had no time
We could not even try
You know we had no time

When it came no one was spared
Still I hear "Burn!"

AMBER

You're such a charmer.

MAURICE

I got you all set up at your booth.

I wanna send over some clams on the half shell.

JACK

MAURICE

Just remember, Jack: I'm available

Amber and Jack head off towards the booth. CAMERA stays with Maurice,
follows him to the bar area, where he shouts some orders to a WAITER.

MAURICE

The WAITER takes off to the kitchen, Maurice walks onto the dance floor and
greets three people;

REED ROTHCHILD, 20s, tall and skinny, BECKY BARNETT, 20s, black girl in

MAURICE

Hello there, kiddies.

and Buck, does a 360 around them. Reed and Becky Disco Dance. Buck does
some Cowboy-Type Moves.

Moments later, the WAITER carrying clams on the half shell passes and
CAMERA picks up with him, follows him to Jack's booth, where he presents
them;

WAITER

Compliments of Maurice.

JACK

Thank you.

AMBER

Can I get a Marguerita, please?

The WAITER exits, CAMERA PANS with him for a moment, leading to a young
girl wearing rollerskates, ROLLERGIRL (aged 18). She always, always wears
rollerskates. CAMERA PANS with her back to Jack's booth.

ROLLERGIRL

Hi.

JACK

Hello, honey.

AMBER

ROLLERGIRL

ROLLERGIRL

OK.

Rollergirl scratches her crotch as she speaks. Amber notices;

AMBER

What's the matter down there?

ROLLERGIRL

I gotta go pee.

AMBER

Well go, then.

CAMERA stays with Rollergirl, following her across the dance floor. She
passes Buck, Becky and Reed, says hello, dances a moment, then continues on
-- into the clearing off the dance floor, heading for the bathroom. She
passes something, CAMERA moves away towards this something:

A bus boy cleaning a table, EDDIE ADAMS, aged 17. CAMERA moves into a CU --
blending to SLOW MOTION (40fps) for a moment.

(Note: In the text Eddie Adams will be referred to as Dirk Diggler.)

ANGLE, JACK'S TABLE.

Jack turns his head, looks across the dance floor and sees this kid
cleaning the table.

ANGLE, DIRK DIGGLER.

He looks up, catches Jack looking back at him, then turns away, disappears
into a back room.

CAMERA DOLLIES in on Jack, who at that moment, is approached by a figure
entering FRAME. Short, buffed out LITTLE BILL (late 40s). This is Jack's
Assistant Director.

cowboy-digs, is talking to a CUSTOMER about a stereo unit. The manager, a
skinny-white guy with a mustache and mustard suit, JERRY (30s) is standing
nearby.

BUCK

-- so basically you're gettin'

twice the base, cause of the TK421

modification we got in this system here.

CUSTOMER

I don't know - do I need that much bass?

BUCK

If you want a system to handle

what you want -- yes you do.

See this system here. This is Hi-Fi.

"High Fidelity." What that means is

that it's the highest quality fidelity.

CUSTOMER

It's the price --

BUCK

I have this unit at home.

CUSTOMER

. . . really . . . ?

BUCK

Yes. But -- I've got it modified

with the TK421, which is a bass unit

that basically kicks in another two,

maybe three quads when you really

crank -- lemme put another eight track

in so you can get a better idea what

I'm talkin about --

Buck ejects the Eight Track that was playing and puts in his own of a
country western song.

BUCK

Hear that bass? It kicks and turns

and curls up in your belly, makes you

wanna freaky-deaky, right? If you get

this unit as it is -- it won't sound

like this without the modification --

and we do that for a small price.

The Customer listens another moment, then;

CUSTOMER

Thank you for your time.

BUCK

No problem.

The Customer exits and Jerry approaches Buck.

JERRY

. . . the fuck was that?

BUCK

Wha?

JERRY

Have I told you? Huh? Have I?

BUCK

What? I don't --

JERRY

Alright: A.) You play that country

western-crap and no one's gonna buy

a stereo. You throw on some KC and

the Sunshine Band, a guy looks a particular

way -- and you've seen the profile sheet --

you throw on some Led Zeppelin. No.

Instead, you play this twingy-twangy,

yappy-dappy music. What kinda brother

are you anyway, listening to that shit?

BUCK

Hey, Jerry, look --

JERRY

No, you look. I gave you a job here

because I thought your film work

might bring some nice pussy in the

place -- and it has -- but I can't

have anymore fuck ups -- you dig?

BUCK

Yeah.

JERRY

Alright. Go unload the new 484's

from the back room.

THE KITCHEN

Dirk is washing dishes. He looks up and spots Rollergirl. She lifts a skate
up just a little . . . She rolls closer to Dirk and pulls him into

A CLOSET SPACE

She goes down on him, unzips his pants and pulls out his cock. She
hesitates. DOLLY IN CLOSE ON HER FACE. She smiles up at Dirk.

22 EXT. HOT TRAXX NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT - LATER

Closing hour. Dirk exits a side door and starts walking. Jack, Amber and
Rollergirl in the Seville pull along side him;

JACK

Hey. Eddie.

DIRK

Hello. Jack?

JACK

Yeah. You wanna ride?

DIRK

I'm goin' pretty far.

ROLLERGIRL

You remember me? Couple hours ago?

DIRK

Yeah . . . I remember you.

AMBER

Come with us, sweetie.

DIRK

Okay.

Dirk gets in the backseat of the car with Rollergirl.

23. INT. CANDY'S COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT - LATER

In a booth, after the meal. Dirk and Rollergirl on one side, Jack and Amber
on the other.

JACK

This thing here, I mean, you understand

one thing and that's this: It costs.

I mean, this stuff costs good ol' American

Green. You got film, you got lights,

you got sound, lab fees, developing, synching,

editing -- next thing you know you're

spending thirty/forty thousand a picture.

DIRK

That's a lot of money.

JACK

Hell yes it's a lot of money, but lemme

tell you something else: You make a good

film and there's practically no end to the

amount of money you can make, Eddie.

AMBER

Have you seen Jack's house?

CAMERA HOLDS ON AMBER. She watches Dirk.

DIRK (OC)

No.

JACK (OC)

He'll see it.

ROLLERGIRL (OC)

He'll see it.

JACK (OC)

Eddie: You got ten, fifteen people around

and that's just to make sure the lighting is

right . . . shit, this is not an operation for

the weak, and lemme tell you something else:

When all is said and done, you gotta have the

juice, you understand? I mean . . . you can work

on your arms, your legs, workout morning, day,

noon, night, the whole deal, but when it comes

right down to it . . . what we need is Mr. Torpedo

Area, y'understand? Mr. Fun Zone? Okay, let's

say you got that: right? And You Do Got, Yeah?

He looks to Rollergirl. She smiles. CAMERA OFF AMBER NOW.

JACK

I can go out -- tonight -- the reputation

I got: I can find myself 15/20 guys,

cocks the size of Willie Mays Baseball Bat:

Do I want that? No. Do I need that? No.

I need actors.

AMBER

Uhhh-ohhh . . . here we go --

JACK

-- Alright, yeah, I need the big dick,

and the big tits -- that GETS them in

the theater. What keeps them in their

seats even after they've come? Huh?

The beauty and the acting.

If you're able to give it up and show the world:

No, not just your cock. Fuck that.

What I'm talking about is showing your

insides, from your heart . . . you understand?

Hey, Sure: GET THEM IN THE THEATER.

That's one thing. I don't want 'em showing up,

sitting down, jacking off and splitting on

the story. I don't want to make that film.

I wanna make the thing that keeps 'em around

even after they've come . . . what happens when you

come? You're done, you wanna split.

My idea, my goal: Suck 'em in with the

story . . . they'll squirt their load and sit in it . . .

Just To See How The Story Ends.

Sometimes we make these films, we wanna

make people laugh a little, then get into

it and fuck heavy: That's good and that's fine.

But I got a dream of making a film that's

true . . . true and right and dramatic.

DIRK

. . . Right . . . right . . . I understand.

AMBER

Don't listen too hard to all this,

honey . . . it's just nice in theory.

JACK

It's a dream to be able to find

a cock and an actor.

ROLLERGIRL

ROLLERGIRL

Here We Go! Are We Gonna Fuck?

JACK

Yes you are.

ROLLERGIRL

Oh, wait, wait, wait, then.

She rolls over to the Hi-Fi system and picks a record. She sets the needle
on the turntable and rolls over to the couch -- in one swift motion ripping
her clothes off.

ROLLERGIRL

You ready?

DIRK

Are you?

ROLLERGIRL

Ohhh-yeah.

They kiss. They lean back on the couch. Dirk stops a moment.

DIRK

Are you gonna take your skates off?

ROLLERGIRL

I don't take my skates off.

DIRK

Okay.

of porno films and she's down on her luck.

She hasn't had a hit in a year. She's

desperate. Her landlord is threatening to kick her

out, so she's desperate for a big dick hit, right?

COLONEL

Yes. Good dilemma.

JACK

Yes. So she calls up all the agencies

in town and says: "Send over your best

actors, I'm casting a porno picture."

Well, the story goes and develops with

Amber auditioning various men and

women . . . the whole thing wraps up with

the Landlord, I'd like to get Jeremy if

he's still in town to play the part --

he comes in -- the landlord says:

You better pay rent or you're through.

Well, Amber does one helluva suck job,

ass fuck, come in the face, sort of thing

and fade out - the end.

There's a kid, a young man, I met him

last night: His name is Eddie Adams.

LITTLE BILL

Jack wants a minimal-thing --

KURT LONGJOHN

Right, well, very often, minimal means

well . . . then I think most people understand . . .

LITTLE BILL

I understand.

No, no. Hey. I know you understand,

I was talking about some other people.

about is minimal, not really "natural,"

but minimal . . .

KURT LONGJOHN

OK . . . fine . . . I was just saying . . .

LITTLE BILL

I understand --

KURT LONGJOHN

-- cause I'm just trying to give each

picture it's own look --

Oh, yeah . . . you have to go somewhere . . . or . . . ?

DIRK

But I'm back now and I'm ready to pursue

This guy he plays, "Johnny Wad," it's always

about slapping some girl around or whatever.

It's not right, it's not cool and it just . . .

isn't sexy. It isn't sexy like it should be.

REED

We could make it more of a James Bond

character. This guy that's world traveled.

JACK

I like that.

DIRK

Reed could play my partner.

JACK

I like this a lot.

DIRK

We could make it really good, Jack.

We should do this.

JACK

Alright. When we get back. We'll set up

just to get a seat.

DIRK

You alone?

JESSIE

Yeah. Just visiting L.A. Some people

told me the food in here was really good.

DIRK

Good. No, it's not good. It's probably

the BEST place to eat in Los Angeles.

It's excellent.

JESSIE

I certainly hope so. I could die of

starvation before I get something in my mouth --

like an outsider.

JESSIE

I know my tits aren't as big and I know

my pussy isn't as tight as all the other

girls in this industry but I still feel

like I've got something that works --

I can paint, too.

DIRK

Yes. Yes. Yes.

JESSIE

I dunno. I was just never really secure.

When I was a kid, I was never really secure

with myself that much -- I guess that's why

I try and act like I'm all care-free and everything.

DIRK

I know what you mean, sometimes I'm like,

"What am I doing?" "What the hell is wrong

with me?" Y'know?

JESSIE

I know, I know.

DIRK

But then . . . I think . . .

JESSIE

-- it's just fun. It's great.

It is. It's the best. I mean, look:

I couldn't be happier than where

I am today, right now, at this moment.

BUCK

No . . . yes, I mean . . . but we were talkin'

BUCK

CUT TO:

91 INT. JACK'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Jack, Floyd Gondolli and the Colonel sitting.

FLOYD

. . . so let's talk about the future.

So let's talk about what video means

to this industry -- and let's talk

about how all of us -- not one of us --

but all of us will profit. I've been doing

theater work in San Francisco and San Diego

for as long as you've been doing stag

and hardcore, Jack.

JACK

I know you're history, Floyd.

COLONEL

No one's doubting your history

or your credentials, Floyd.

FLOYD

Then why the resistance? I mean:

This industry is going to be turned

upside down soon enough --

JACK

Then why help it?

FLOYD

Why not be prepared? The money comes

from the Colonel, the talent comes from

you, Jack. I've got a connection to the

equipment and the mail order distribution,

not to mention those kids I got out there

who are hot-fuck-action to the max.

This is the future. Video tape tells the truth.

JACK

I have a stable of actors and actresses.

They're professionals. They're not

a bunch of fucking amateurs. They're

proven box office and they get people

in theaters (where films should be seen)

and they know how to fuck well --

FLOYD

That's right, Jack and by that

same token, you're the one with the

power here. The video revolution

is upon us -- and our role is critical.

We have an obligation to use our resources

and talent to help make it fly --

JACK

You come in here, at my party, tell me about

this and that -- tell me about the future,

tell me about -- video and amateurs and

all that -- well lemme tell you something now:

I will not shoot films on video and no

I will not loan out my actors who are

under contract to me. Period.

FLOYD

Wait a minute, Jack. I'm not a complicated man.

I like cinema. In particular, I like to

see fucking on film. I don't want to win

an Oscar and I don't want to re-invent the

wheel -- I enjoy simple pleasures like butter

in my ass and lollipops in my mouth.

That's me -- call me crazy, call me a pervert,

but this is something I enjoy. One other

small thing I want to do in this life is make

a dollar and a cent in this business -- I'm not

trying to hurt you. I'm trying to help you stay

one step ahead of the game --

JACK

We're repeating ourselves now, Floyd.

COLONEL

Jack, I think this is about cost and future --

JACK

The future is as bright as we make it --

it shouldn't be sacrificed for a few dollars

that can be saved shooting on video tape --

if it looks like shit and sounds like shit,

it probably is shit --

FLOYD

I think you're one gin past this conversation --

JACK

No . . . no. I'm crystal clear here.

COLONEL

Jack, please understand that this is

not an argument . . . this is a fact of --

JACK

. . . What . . . ?

COLONEL

This is not an argument, but a --

JACK

What are you saying?

COLONEL

What do you mean, Jack, c'mon --

JACK

Are you telling me that you're

working with this shit?

COLONEL

I think that there is a serious case

to be made for the price and the gamble

on the whole idea of a home video market --

Jack: Two, three years from now, everyone's

gonna be able to walk into their local

supermarket and buy or rent a videocassette --

JACK

True film fans won't watch that shit.

It doesn't look good and more importantly

it doesn't make sex look sexy.

COLONEL

It doesn't have to look good, Jack.

Film is just too damn expensive.

The theaters are already planning

converting to video projectors.

JACK

I haven't heard that.

FLOYD

It's true.

JACK

We've got ten minutes until the New

Year and I don't want it to start like this

so I'm leaving now. We will or we won't

continue this conversation some other time.

Jack leaves. Floyd looks to the Colonel. HOLD.

AMBER

Make sure you snort it back quick and hard . . .

She demonstrates. Dirk hesitates a moment, then leans down and does a line
of coke.

DIRK

It burns.

AMBER

It's good, though, right?

DIRK

It's in my throat . . . uch . . .

AMBER

It's the drip . . . the drip's the best part.

Amber is sitting in a room with a long desk, a few chairs and fluorescent
lights. A middle aged female JUDGE enters and greets her;

JUDGE

Hello. You must be Maggie?

AMBER

Yes.

JUDGE

I'm Kathleen O'Malley. The judge.

AMBER

Yes.

JUDGE

You have a lawyer with you?

AMBER

No. I don't. I do not.

They sit in silence. The Judge looks over a couple of files. Moments later,
Amber's ex-husband, THOMAS (late 30s) steps in with his LAWYER. They all
take seats.

LAWYER

Hello, Judge.

Introductions happen, etc. BEAT. The Judge looks over some files;

JUDGE

You've been divorced for six years.

AMBER

Yes. Since 1977.

JUDGE

(to lawyer)

And the agreement on the money settlement

was taken care of?

LAWYER

Yes.

JUDGE

So. What we're talking about then

is coming to an agreement on custody of Andrew?

AMBER

Yes.

JUDGE

What was decided during the divorce?

LAWYER

Initially, Andrew went with his father,

and visitation was given to his mother on --

(looks at a paper)

from Saturday Noon to Sunday at seven.

With his mother entitled to bring Andrew

to her home or any reasonable place.

JUDGE

(to Amber)

Was that the understanding?

AMBER

Yes.

JUDGE

And why wasn't that visiting privilege honored?

THOMAS

Well, it was for a time --

AMBER

I only saw him twice.

THOMAS

It said, "reasonable place," and I didn't

think a house of drugs and prostitution

and pornography was that.

JUDGE

I'm sorry, what is it that you --

THOMAS

My ex-wife is involved in the pornography

business -- I didn't think that environment

was a safe place for my son.

AMBER

This is not right. My son was never

exposed to pornographic material or

drugs or any of these things, my husband

just assumed --

THOMAS

I saw it with my own eye.

PAUSE. Amber has no response. The Judge looks down at the file.

JUDGE

Did you register this as a complaint?

LAWYER

My client didn't officially register,

but I think the circumstance called

for something immediate -- for the

safety of the child.

JUDGE

How old is the boy now?

THOMAS

He's twelve.

AMBER

He'll be thirteen next month.

JUDGE

Where do you live now?

THOMAS

We live in Long Beach. I have a job

there and my new wife is home with him.

(pause)

You see, the problem is, Judge, is that

my ex-wife is a sick . . . she is a very sick

person and she needs help. She deals in

drugs and sex for a living --

AMBER

I don't do drugs.

LAWYER

Your honor, she has been in and out

of trouble with the law on quite a few

occasions regarding this sort of thing.

AMBER

No. No. Not anymore

CAMERA HOLDS ON AMBER. She watches the Judge. OC there's the sound of
papers shuffling.

JUDGE (OC)

Have you ever been arrested?

AMBER

mingling around the background. CAMERA DOES A SLOW 360 AROUND THE TABLE.

TODD

Alright. I think this could be the thing.

Something to help us score a little extra cash.

I think if we decide to do this, we gotta

be one hundred percent.

REED

I agree.

TODD

This guy's name is Rahad Jackson.

He's got more money than God and twice

as much coke, crack and smack. He'll buy

just about anything anybody wants to sell him.

He just likes people hanging out at his house

and partying.

DIRK

How do you know him?

TODD

He used to come into Party Boys

once in a while. Mutrix introduced me --

DIRK

And how would we do it, exactly?

I mean, how would it all go down?

TODD

It's like this: I call him up,

tell him I got half a key of quality stuff.

REED

Do you have his phone number?

TODD

Yeah. So we call him up, give him the price.

DIRK

How much?

TODD

Half a key for like . . . five thousand bucks.

Split it three ways --

DIRK

That's enough to get my Vette fixed.

TODD

That's right. So we set up the deal,

dump half a kilo of baking soda in a

bag and walk over to his house -- BOOM.

Right there -- this could be a nifty bit

o' hustle-bustle.

REED

Do you have his address?

TODD

Fuckin', Reed, yeah I have his address, c'mon.

DIRK

What if he tests it out?

TODD

He won't.

DIRK

How do you know?

TODD

I know he won't. I'm positive. Believe me.

REED

It's a pretty good idea.

DIRK

I think we should go for it.

Scotty J. comes over to the table.

SCOTTY J.

You guys should be careful with this.

DIRK

Scotty?

SCOTTY J.

What?

DIRK

Just . . . y'know . . . mind yer own business.

SCOTTY J.

Sorry.

172 EXT. RAHAD JACKSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The Corvette pulls up in front of a tacky one-story house in the hills of
Studio City. The Corvette stops and CAMERA DOLLIES IN QUICK. Dirk, Reed,
Todd sit in the parked car. In sotto;

DIRK

Okay.

TODD

You guys ready for this?

REED

I am.

TODD

Dirk?

DIRK

Me? Yeah . . . yeah, I'm ready. I was born ready.

TODD

Alright.

Todd takes out a .45 AUTOMATIC PISTOL and loads a cartridge.

DIRK

What the fuck is that?

TODD

It's a big gun.

DIRK

I know, but why?

TODD

Just in case, just in case. Let's go.

They pile out of the damaged Corvette and walk up. CAMERA (STEADICAM)
follows them.

REED

I'm nervous.

TODD

It'll be okay.

REED

Let's get in and out, in and out.

TODD

Not too quick -- that looks suspicious.

Lemme do the talking --

They arrive and ring the doorbell.

CUT TO:

173 INT. RAHAD JACKSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT - THAT MOMENT

A really big fat black BODYGUARD comes to the door and opens up:

BODYGUARD

Hello. Come on in.

The bodyguard leads them down a hall and into a tacky and spacious, sunken
LIVING ROOM.

They're greeted by a man in a silk robe, slightly open to show some bikini
briefs and a thin sheen of sweat covering his body: RAHAD JACKSON (late
40s).

Off in a corner of the room, a YOUNG ASIAN KID is casually throwing some
FIRECRACKERS around.

Rahad is DANCING around by himself to NIGHT RANGER, "SISTER CHRISTIAN." He
spots the men;

RAHAD

Hello, friends. Which one is Todd?

TODD

That's me. We met before at the club --

RAHAD

Oh, yeah. Come on in here.

TODD

These are my friends Dirk and Reed.

RAHAD

Great to meet you. You guys want something

to drink -- or a pill -- or some coke --

or some dope?

DIRK/REED/TODD

No thank you, thanks, no.

RAHAD

So what do we have, we have, something, yeah?

TODD

Here it is . . . half a key . . . it's really good,

if you wanna test it out --

RAHAD

Oh, wait a minute, I love this part:

(sings along)

"SISTER CHRISTIAN, THERE'S SO MUCH

IN LIFE, DON'T YOU GIVE IT UP BEFORE

YOUR TIME IS DUE . . . IT'S TRUE!"

(to Dirk)

This song is so amazing.

Anyway: What's the price?

TODD

We were thinking five thousand.

RAHAD

That's good. No problem, cool, cool.

The Bodyguard brings over a PAPER BAG FULL OF CASH and hands the bag to
Todd in exchange for the PAPER BAG FULL OF BAKING SODA.

Reed watches the Bodyguard take the bag and notices something. REED'S POV:
a SHOULDER HOLSTER holds a .45 Automatic Pistol.

Rahad does an air guitar solo to the Night Ranger song . . . he walks
across the room, picks up a COKE PIPE and looks to the guys;

RAHAD

You wanna play baseball?

DIRK/REED/TODD

No thank you.

Rahad strokes the pipe while dancing. Dirk looks across to an open bedroom
door.

DIRK'S POV: Through the crack in the door, we can see a bloody, battered
YOUNG BLACK WOMAN in a silk robe . . .she's followed by another YOUNG WHITE
GIRL in nothing.

RAHAD (OC)

Check this out --

He takes out a nickel plated REVOLVER and loads a single bullet, spins the
chamber and puts it to his head and sings;

RAHAD

SISTER CHRISTIAN -- OH THE TIME HAS

COME . . . AND YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE

THE ONLY ONE TO SAY . . . OK . . .

He pulls the trigger . . . Click . . . he smiles and casually speaks;

RAHAD

I put a mix tape together of all

my favorite songs . . . This is song number

three . . . I love putting mix tapes together,

you know . . . if you buy an album or tape or

something, those guys put the songs in their

order and they try and say how you should listen

to the songs, but I don't like that.

I don't like to be told what to listen

to, when to listen to or anything . . .

The Night Ranger song FADES OUT . . . BEAT . . . Rahad smiles at the Asian
Kid who's casually throwing some firecrackers around.

RAHAD

(to Dirk/Reed/Todd)

He's Chinese . . . he loves to set

off firecrackers . . .

REO SPEEDWAGON, "CAN'T FIGHT THIS FEELING," begins to play.

RAHAD

I CAN'T FIGHT THIS FEELING ANY LONGER

AND YET I'm STILL AFRAID TO LET IT FLOW.

WHAT STARTED OUT AS FRIENDSHIP HAS GROWN

STRONGER -- I ONLY WISH I HAD THE STRENGTH

TO LET IT SHOW --

DIRK

Well . . . I think maybe . . . we better get going --

RAHAD

No, stay. Hang out. We'll party.

DIRK

No, we really gotta split.

We have to be somewhere and we --

Dirk and Rahad continue to haggle about leaving/not leaving. CAMERA BEGINS
A SLOW DOLLY INTO A CU ON TODD.

TODD

We're Not Leaving Yet.

Dirk and Reed look at Todd. He stands up.

TODD

We're here now and we want something else.

Hey -- Hey. We Want Something Else From You.

RAHAD

What?

DIRK

Todd -- what the hell are you doing?

TODD

In the master bedroom, under the bed,

in a floor safe . . . You understand?

The Bodyguard turns his head. Dirk and Reed are confused;

DIRK

Todd . . . what the fuck, man, c'mon --

TODD

Shut up, Dirk. I told you I got a plan.

I got a good plan.

RAHAD

Are you kiddin' me kittie?

TODD

No I'm not. I'm not kidding. We want

what's in the safe. We want what's in

the safe in the floor under the bed in

the master bedroom.

DIRK

Todd -- don't be crazy.

(to Rahad)

Sir -- we don't know anything about this.

This is not the thing that we wanted.

TODD

SHUT THE FUCK UP, DIRK.

The BODYGUARD reaches into his coat . . .

. . . Todd pulls his REVOLVER quickly and AIMS at the Bodyguard.

TODD

Don't reach for your gun.

. . . Rahad reacts by AIMING HIS GUN AT TODD . . .

RAHAD

You don't wanna do this, friendly.

TODD

You've only got one bullet.

Rahad PULLS THE TRIGGER . . . a bullet FIRES from the gun and strikes Todd
in the SHOULDER . . . the gun in his hand falls to the floor and he
stumbles back . . .

. . . The Bodyguard takes this moment to GRAB HIS OWN GUN from the holster
and FIRE off shots at Dirk and Reed . . .

. . . Bullets graze past them and they DUCK FOR COVER . . .

. . . The GIRLS in the bedroom SCREAM and SHOUT at the gunfire . . .

. . . A STRAY BULLET HITS the ASIAN KID in the heart, but he doesn't fall .
. .

. . . TODD reaches hold of his gun, crouches for cover and FIRES a bullet
STRAIGHT INTO the Bodyguard . . . who falls back DEAD . . . Todd looks
right and sees:

RAHAD scuttles into the bedroom with the women . . . Todd looks over his
shoulder to Dirk and Reed;

DIRK

WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING, TODD?

TODD

He went in the bedroom.

DIRK

ARE YOU CRAZY? WHEN DID YOU GO CRAZY?

TODD

He's got cash and coke in the safe

under the bed -- if we leave here

without it we're fools.

REED

Let's just split, let's just split

right now, Todd. Don't be stupid.

This wasn't part of the deal.

TODD

I'm goin' in that bedroom and get what's

in that safe. Are you coming?

DIRK

Fuck no. Todd. Don't. Don't do it.

Todd gets up and heads for the bedroom with his revolver at the ready . . .
he inches closer to the door and twists the door knob, then KICKS THE DOOR
OPEN;

. . . Rahad is standing right there, holding a SAWED OFF SHOTGUN. He pulls
the trigger . . . Todd blinks . . .

. . . Rahad's SHOTGUN BLAST blows Todd BACK and UP in the air about fifteen
feet . . . he FALLS to the ground with a HOLE in his STOMACH about the size
of a basketball . . . Rahad calls out to Dirk and Reed;

RAHAD

C'mon out, little puppies. You want to

come and see, come and see, to get what

is coming down. Coming down.

Rahad peers out from his bedroom, sees a sliver of Dirk behind the wall.
Rahad FIRES HIS SHOTGUN . . . which cuts right past Dirk's head and SHREDS
the wall near him . . .

Reed and Dirk make a DASH for the front door . . .

crouched -- he opens the door and starts to get in --

ANOTHER SHOT BLOWS THE PASSENGER'S SIDE WINDOW OUT.

GLASS SPRAYS IN HIS EYES AND HIS HAND SLIPS DOWN, RELEASING THE EMERGENCY

. . . he looks down the street: the Corvette is ROLLING away and picking up
speed as it goes down the hill --

A young PAPERBOY rides past and throws the paper, hitting Dirk in the head.
He hesitates, then walks up the steps;

THE END



[Intro]
You're lazy, you just stay in bed
You're lazy just stay in bed
You don't want no money
You don't want no bread

[Verse]
If you're drowning you don't clutch no straw
If you're drowning you don't clutch no straw
You don't want to live you don't want to cry no more
Well my trying ain't done no good
I said my trying ain't done no good
You don't make no effort no not like you should

[Outro]
Lazy you just stay in bed
Lazy you just stay in bed
You don't want no money
You don't want no bread



[Verse 1]
Can you remember
Remember my name
As I flow through your life
A thousand oceans I have flown

And cold
Cold spirits of ice
All my life
I am the echo of your past

I am returning the echo of a point in time
And distant faces shine
A thousand warriors I have known

And laughing as the spirits appear
All your life
Shadows of another day

[Chorus]
And if you hear me talking on the wind
You've got to understand
We must remain
Perfect Strangers

[Verse 2]
I know I must remain inside this silent well of sorrow
A strand of silver hanging through the sky
Touching more than you see

The voice of ages in your mind
Is aching with the dead of the night
Precious life (your tears are lost in falling rain)

[Chorus]
And if you hear me talking on the wind
You've got to understand
We must remain
Perfect Strangers



[Verse 1]
We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
But Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground

[Chorus]
Smoke on the water and fire in the sky
Smoke on the water

[Verse 2]
They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
(Uh) Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race

[Chorus]
Smoke on the water and fire in the sky
Smoke on the water

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights, a few old beds
We made a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know I know we'll never forget

[Chorus]
Smoke on the water and fire in the sky
Smoke on the water



[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
We had a lot of luck on Venus
We always had a ball on Mars
We meeting all the groovy people
We've rocked the Milky Way so far
We danced around with Borealis
We're space trucking round the the stars

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, come on, let's go Space Truckin'
Come on, come on, come on, Space Truckin'

[Verse 2]
Remember when we did the moonshot
And Pony Trekker led the way?
We'd move to the Canaveral moonstop
And everynaut would dance and sway
We got music in our solar system
We're space truckin' round the stars

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, come on, let's go Space Truckin'
Come on, come on, come on, Space Truckin'

[Verse 3]
The fireball that we rode was moving
But now we've got a new machine
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, the freaks said
"Man those cats can really swing"
They got music in their solar system
They've rocked around the Milky Way
They dance around the Borealis
They're Space Truckin' everyday

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, come on, let's go Space Truckin'
Come on, come on, come on, Space Truckin'

[Guitar Solo]

[Drum Solo]

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, come on, let's go Space Truckin'
Come on, come on, come on, Space Truckin'

[Outro]

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Space Truckin'
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Space Truckin'



[Verse 1]
Fly into the rising sun
Faces, smiling everyone
Yeah, she is a whole new tradition
I feel it in my heart

[Chorus]
My woman from Tokyo
She makes me see
My woman from Tokyo
She's so good to me

[Verse 2]
Talk about her like a Queen
Dancing in a Eastern Dream
Yeah, she makes me feel like a river
That carries me away

[Chorus]
My woman from Tokyo
She makes me see
My woman from Tokyo
She's so good to me
But I'm at home and I just don't belong

[Verse 3]
So far away from the garden we love
She is what moves in the soul of a dove
Soon I shall see just how black was my night
When we're alone in Her City of light
Rising from the neon gloom
Shining like a crazy moon
Yeah, she turns me on like a fire
I get high

[Chorus]
My woman from Tokyo
She makes me see
My woman from Tokyo
She's so good to me

My woman from Tokyo
She makes me see
My woman from Tokyo
She's so good to me

My woman from Tokyo
My woman from Tokyo
My woman from Tokyo
My woman from Tokyo
My woman from Tokyo



[Verse 1]
A wild ride, over stony ground
Such a lust for life, the circus comes to town
We are the hungry ones, on a lightning raid
Just like a river runs, like a fire needs flame
Oh, I burn for you

[Chorus]
I got to feel it in my blood, whoa, oh
I need your touch don't need your love, whoa, oh
And I want, and I need, and I lust, animal
And I want, and I need, and I lust, animal

[Verse 2]
I cry wolf, given mouth to mouth
Like a moving heartbeat, in the witching hour
I'm running with the wind, a shadow in the dust
And like the driving rain, hey, like the restless rust
I never sleep

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Huh! Oh! Cry wolf baby, cry tough
Going to hunt you like an, uh, uh, animal
Going to take your love and run

[Chorus]

[Outro]
And I want (And I want)
And I need (And I need)
And I lust (And I lust)
Animal (Animal)

And I want (Take me)
And I need (Tame me)
And I lust (Make me)
Animal (Your Animal)

And I want (Show me)
And I need (Stroke me)
And I lust (Let me be your)
Animal (Animal)

And I want (I want)
And I need (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
And I lust
Animal (Animal)



[Verse 1]
You better come inside when you're ready to
But no chance if you don't wanna dance
You like a four letter words when you're ready to
But then you won't 'cause you know that you can
You got it
But are you getting it?
You say that love is won when you get some
But then your finger won't trigger the gun

[Chorus 1]
You know you can't stop it, so don't rock it
You know you got it
Hey, but are you getting it?
Ooh, really getting it?
Come get it from me

[Chorus 2]
(Give me all of your loving)
Every little bit
(Give me all that you got)
Every bit of it
(Every bit of your loving)
Oh, come on live a bit
(Never want to stop)

[Bridge]
Yeah, but are you getting it?
(Armageddon it)
Ooh, really getting it?
(Yes, Armageddon it)
Come on get it
Yeah
Do, do, do
Uh oh

[Verse 2]
You try coming on when you need some
But then you don't because you already did
Yeah, you jangle your jewels while you're shaking your
And drive the pretty boys out of their heads
You got it
But are you getting it?
You flash your bedroom eyes like a jumping Jack
Then play it pretty with a pat on the back

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Bridge]
Yeah, but are you getting it?
(Armageddon it)
Ooh, really getting it?
(Yes, Armageddon it)
Come on, Steve, get it, huh

[Verse 3]
Take it, take it, take it from me
I got an itchy finger following me
Pull it, pull it, come on trigger the gun
Because the best is a yet to come
I say
(Because the best is yet to come)

[Bridge]
Oh, are you getting it?
Oh, really getting it?
Yes, are you getting it?
Whoa, really getting it?

[Outro]
Come get it from me
(Give me all of you loving)
Every little bit
(Give me all that you got)
Every bit of it
(Every bit of your loving)
Oh, come on live a bit
(Never want it to stop)

Oh, are you getting it?
(Give me all of your loving)
Ooh, really getting it?
(Give me all that you got)
Oh are you getting it?
(Give me all of your loving)
Oh, live a bit
(Give me all that you got)

No, live a bit
You've got to live it
(Give ne all of your loving)
Ooh, baby live it
(Give me all that you got)
Come on and give it
(Every bit of your loving)
Oh, come on and give it
(Never want it to stop)

Oh, are you getting it?
(Give me all of your loving)
Ooh, really getting it?
(Give me all that you got)
Oh, are you getting it?
(Every bit of your loving)
Oh, live a bit
(Never want it to stop)
Whoa
(Give me all of your loving)



Gypsy, sittin' looking pretty
A broken rose with laughin' eyes
You're a mystery, always runnin' wild
Like a child without a home
You're always searchin', searchin' for a feeling
But it's easy come and easy go
Oh I'm sorry but it's true

You're bringin' on the heartache
Takin' all the best if me, oh can't you see?
You got the best of me, oh can't you see?

You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache
You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache
Can't you see?

You're such a secret, misty eyes and shady
Lady how you hold the key
Oh you're like a candle, your flame slowly fadin'
Burnin' out and burnin' me
Can't you see, just tryin' to say to you

You're bringin' on the heartache
Takin' all the best of me, oh can't you see?
You got the best of me, oh can't you see?

You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache
You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache
Can't you see, Can't you see

No! No! No!

You got the best of me, oh can't you see?
You got the best of me, oh can't you see?

You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache
You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache
You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringinn' on the heartache
You're bringin' on the heartbreak



[Verse 1]
Lady luck never smiles
So lend your love to me awhile
Do with me what you will
Break the spell take your fill
On and on we rode the storm
The flame has died and the fire has gone
Oh, this empty bed is a night alone
I realized that long ago

[Chorus]
Is anybody out there, anybody there?
Does anybody wonder, anybody care?
Oh, I just got to know
If you're really there and you really care
Because baby I'm not
Fooling, ah fooling, fooling, ah fooling
Won't you stay with me awhile?

[Verse 2]
Close your eyes don't run and hide
Easy love is no easy ride
Just waking up from what we had
Could stop good love from going bad

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
I'm not fooling myself
I'm not fooling myself
I'm not fooling myself
I'm not fooling myself



[Verse 1]
Out of touch, out of reach, yeah
You could try to get closer to me
I'm in love, I'm in deep, yeah
Hypnotized, I'm shaking to my knees

[Pre-Chorus]
I got to know tonight
If you're alone tonight
Can't stop this feeling
Can't stop this fire

[Chorus]
Oh, I get hysterical, hysteria, oh, can you feel it, do you believe it?
It's such a magical mysteria
When you get that feeling better start believing
Because it's a miracle, oh, say you will, ooh babe
Hysteria when you're near

[Verse 2]
Out of me, into you, yeah
You can hide, it's just a one way street
Oh, I believe I'm in you, yeah
Open wide that's right, dream me off my feet
Oh, believe in me

[Pre-Chorus]
I got to know tonight
If you're alone tonight
Can't stop this feeling
Can't stop this fire

[Chorus]
Oh, I get hysterical, hysteria, oh, can you feel it, do you believe it?
It's such a magical mysteria
When you get that feeling better start believing
Because it's a miracle, oh, say you will, ooh babe
Hysteria when you're near

[Pre-Chorus]
I got to know tonight
If you're alone tonight
Can't stop this feeling
Can't stop this fire

[Chorus]
Oh, I get hysterical, hysteria, oh, can you feel it, do you believe it?
It's such a magical mysteria
When you get that feeling better start believing
Because it's a miracle, oh, say you will, ooh babe
Hysteria when you're near

[Chorus 2]
I get hysterical, hysteria
When you get that feeling, you'd better believe it
Better start believing, because it's a miracle
Oh, say you will, oh babe, say you will

[Outro]
Get closer to me, get closer baby
Baby, closer, get closer, closer to me



[Verse 1]
When you make love, do you look in the mirror?
Who do you think of, does he look like me?
Do you tell lies? And say that it's forever
Do you think twice, or just touch and see
Ooh, babe
Oh, yeah
When you're alone, do you let go?
Are you wild and willing or is it just for show?
Ooh, come on

[Chorus 1]
I don't want to touch you too much baby
Because making love to you might drive me crazy
I know you think that love is the way you make it
So I don't want to be there when you decide to break it
No

[Chorus 2]
Love bites, love bleeds
It's bringing me to my knees
Love lives, love dies
It's no surprise
Love begs, love pleads
It's what I need

[Verse 2]
When I'm with you, are you somewhere else?
Am I getting through or do you please yourself?
When you wake up, will you walk out?
It can't be love if you throw it about

[Chorus 1]
Ooh, babe
I don't want to touch you too much baby
Because making love to you might drive me crazy
Oh

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
Love bites, love bleeds
It's bringing me to my knees
Love lives, love dies

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
If you've got love in your sights
Watch out
Love bites



[Verse 1]
The wait is done, the battle's won
So count the cost before you run
Because on and on your time was power
The clock on the wall ticks away the hours
Come on down, you're flying high
You'll never win if you never try
Stop the hate and carry the load
Come on, get this show on the road

[Chorus]
On through the night
You can't stop me now
On through the night
You won't stop me anyhow

[Verse 2]
The stakes are high and getting higher
I'm flat on my face and you call me liar
I'm watching you, you're watching me
You're watching every move that I can see
My reputation's still at stake
I play it safe for safety's sake
Your ego and your promises
Are going to fade again and again

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Not anyhow
All you want to hear
Is the audience applause
You can't get on stage
For a country clause
And the road ahead seems a little rough
If you want to know my feelings
I say that's tough, that's tough
Your wheels ain't turning, you're out of gas
You pay by check but they take cash
Two roads ahead but which to take
And you can't see it's your mistake

[Bridge]
They're waiting for you
They're waiting for me
And what seems like eternity
It's all tradition, it'll get you yet
In rock'n'roll there's no safety net

[Chorus]

[Outro]
On through the night
Going on and on, on and on
On through the night
You can't stop me anyhow
Oh, no no, anyhow



[Chorus 1]
Every time I see your face
It reminds me of the places we used to go
But all I've got is a photograph
And I realise you're not coming back any more

[Verse 1]
I thought I'd make it
The day you went away
But I can't make it
Till you come home again to stay-yi-yay-yi-yay

[Chorus 2]
I can't get used to living here
While my heart is broke, my tears I cried for you
I want you here to have and hold
As the years go by and we grow old and grey

[Verse 2]
Now you're expecting me
To live without you
But that's not something
That I'm looking forward to

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1][x3]



[Intro]
Step inside
Walk this way
You and me babe
Hey hey!

[Verse 1]
Love is like a bomb, baby, c'mon get it on
Livin' like a lover with a radar phone
Lookin' like a tramp, like a video vamp
Demolition woman, can I be your man?

Razzle 'n' a dazzle 'n' a flash a little light
Television lover, baby, go all night
Sometime, anytime, sugar me sweet
Little miss ah innocent sugar me, yeah

[Pre Chorus]

[Post Chorus]
I'm hot, sticky sweet
From my head to my feet, yeah

Listen! red light, yellow light, green-a-light go!
Crazy little woman in a one man show
Mirror queen, mannequine, rhythm of love
Sweet dream, saccharine, loosen up
Loosen up

You gotta squeeze a little, squeeze a little
Tease a little more
Easy operator come a knockin' on my door
Sometime, anytime, sugar me sweet
Little miss innocent sugar me, yeah, yeah
Give a little more

[Pre Chorus]
Take a bottle, shake it up
Break the bubble, break it up

[Chorus]

From my head to my feet, yeah

[Bridge]
You got the peaches, I got the cream
Sweet to taste, saccharine
Cause I'm hot, say what, sticky sweet
From my head, my head, to my feet

Do you take sugar? one lump or two?

[Pre Chorus]
Take a bottle, shake it up
Break the bubble, break it up

[Chorus]
Pour some sugar on me
Ooh, in the name of love
Pour some sugar on me
C'mon fire me up
Pour your sugar on me
Oh, I can't get enough

[Outro]
Pour some sugar on me
Oh, in the name of love
Pour some sugar on me

Pour your sugar on me
Pour some sugar on me
Yeah! Sugar me!

[Intro]
Guitar, drums

[Verse 1]
White lights, strange city, mad music
(All around)
Midnight, street magic, crazy people
(Crazy sound)
Jack Flash, Rocket Man
Sergeant Pepper and the band
Ziggy, Benny and the Jets
Ah, take a rocket

[Chorus]
We just gotta fly
(I can take you through the center of the dark)
We're gonna fly
(On a collision course to crash into my heart)
I will be your, I will be your, I will be your

[Verse 1]
Somewhere in the distance, I hear the bells ring
Darkness settles on the town as the children start to sing
And the lady across the street, she shuts out the night
There's a cast of thousands waiting as she turns out the light

[Chorus]
But it's too late, too late, too late
Too late for love
Too late, too late, too late
Too late

[Verse 2]
London boys are gazing, girls go hand in hand
With a pocket full of innocence, their entrance is grand
And the queen of the dream, stands before them all
She stretches out her hand as the curtains start to fall

[Chorus]

Standing by the trapdoor, aware of me and you
Are the actor and the clown, they're waiting for their cue
And there's a lady over there, she's acting pretty cool
But when it comes to playing life, she always plays the fool

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Is it all too late?
Much too late?
Can't you see it's all too late?
Yeah, it's too late

[Chorus][x2]



[Verse 1]
Words like violence
Break the silence
Come crashing in
Into my little world
Painful to me
Pierce right through me
Can't you understand
Oh my little girl

[Chorus]
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

[Verse 2]
Vows are spoken
To be broken
Feelings are intense
Words are trivial
Pleasures remain
So does the pain
Words are meaningless
And forgettable

[Chorus]
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

[Chorus]
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

[Outro]
Enjoy the silence



[Intro]

Bell bottom blues, you made me cry
I don't want to lose this feeling
And if I could choose a place to die
It would be in your arms

Do you want to see me crawl across the floor to you?
Do you want to hear me beg you to take me back?
I'd gladly do it because
I don't want to fade away
Give me one more day, please
I don't want to fade away
In your heart I want to stay

It's all wrong, but it's all right
The way that you treat me baby
Once I was strong but I lost the fight
You won't find a better loser

Do you want to see me crawl across the floor to you?
Do you want to hear me beg you to take me back?
I'd gladly do it because
I don't want to fade away
Give me one more day, please
I don't want to fade away
In your heart I want to stay

{Instrumental}

Do you want to see me crawl across the floor to you?
Do you want to hear me beg you to take me back?
I'd gladly do it cause
I don't want to fade away
Give me one more day, please
I don't want to fade away
In your heart I want to stay

Bell bottom blues, don't say goodbye
I'm sure we're gonna meet again
And if we do, don't you be surprised
If you find me with another lover

Do you want to see me crawl across the floor to you?
Do you want to hear me beg you to take me back?
I'd gladly do it cause
I don't want to fade away
Give me one more day, please
I don't want to fade away
In your heart I want to stay

I don't want to fade away
Give me one more day please
I don't want to fade away
In your heart I want to stay

I don't want to fade away
Give me one more day please
I don't want to fade away
In your heart I want to stay



Have you ever loved a woman
So much you tremble in pain?
Have you ever loved a woman
So much you tremble in pain?

And all the time you know, yeah
She bears another man's name

But you just love that woman
So much it's a shame and a sin
You just love that woman, yes
So much it's a shame and a sin

But all the time you know, yes you know
She belongs to your very best friend

Have you ever loved a woman
And you know you can't leave her alone?
Have you ever loved a woman, yes
And you know you can't leave her alone?

Something deep inside of you
Won't let you wreck your best friend's home



[Opening Instrumental Riff]

What'll you do when you get lonely
And nobody's waiting by your side
You've been running and hiding much too long
You know it's just your foolish pride

Layla, you've got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging, darling please
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind

I tried to give you consolation
When your old man had let you down
Like a fool, I fell in love with you
Turned my whole world upside down

Layla, you've got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging, darling please
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind

Let's make the best of the situation
Before I finally go insane
Please don't say we'll never find a way
And tell me all my love's in vain

Layla, you've got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging, darling please
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind

[Instrumental Outro]



Effective incentives
How dare you stand corrected
No motives, intentions
A single thought to call your own
Deceptive, defensive
Don't look at me rejected
Conclusions, dillusions
Look at you standing all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone

A passive aggressive
You didn't get the message
A second opinion
A word that turned into a crime
A massive offensive
You seem to me obsessive
Your version diversion
So tell me something I don't know
All alone, all alone, all alone

Effective incentives
How dare you stand corrected
A motive, intentions
Beyond all reconginition
Deceptive, defensive
Don't look at me rejected
A passive aggressive, you didn't get the message
A massive offensive you seem to me obsessive
Conclusions, delusions
Look at you standing all alone



[Strophe 1: Rocko Schamoni]
Wenn du dich im Spiegel betrachtest
Und wenn du deine Falten verachtest
Wenn du dran denkst
Wie dein Leben war

Dann siehst du ein Mädchen voller Sehnsucht und Träume
Ein Land so voller Grenzen und Zäune
Es scheint so lang her
Und ist doch so nah

[Refrain]
Angela - was hat die Macht aus dir gemacht
Angela - wo früher Tag war, ist jetzt Nacht
Angela - hätt’st du das jemals gedacht
Angela - das dich die Macht so leblos macht
So leblos macht

[Rocko Schamoni] Jan, sing along with me, c’mon
[Jan Böhmermann] Darf ich mitsingen? Nein, hahaha

[Strophe 2: Jan Böhmermann]
Du wolltest nur das Beste für alle
Der Weg dahin is’ eine Falle
Jetzt schwebst du allein
In eisigen Höh’n

[Rocko Schamoni & Jan Böhmermann]
Dein Körper ist zu Marmor geworden
Dein Busen ist ein Friedhof für Orden
Und unter dir hörst du
Das Räderwerk dünn

[Refrain]
Angela - was hat die Macht aus dir gemacht
Angela - wo früher Tag war, ist jetzt Nacht
Angela - hätt’st du das jemals gedacht
Angela - das dich die Macht so leblos macht
So leblos macht

Sing it, Dende
C’mon, Dende

[Strophe 3: Dendemann]
Das A ist für die Anderen, denn die liegen dir am Herzen
Das N wie Nation, ein wiederkehrender Schmerz
Das macht dich zur G, zu ’ner Gangsterbraut
Und mit dem E wie Euro bist du ja längst vertraut
Das L steht für Liebe, schreit Alemania
Denn das zweite A, na klar, steht für Alemania
Angela M., Bundeskanzlerin
Steht wie ’ne Eiche, wenn die Jungs den Schwanz einzieh’n
Ja, lacht ihr mal, lacht ihr nur, lacht
Aber Schhhh, nicht so laut, von dem Krach wird sie wach
Aus 5 vor 12 wird über Nacht Viertelnacht
Kleine Angie, pass auf, was die Macht mit dir macht
Werde Teil der Genius-Deutschland-Community!



[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Holy Diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh what's becoming of me?
Ride the tiger
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh don't you see what I mean?

[Chorus]
Gotta get away
Holy Diver

[Verse 2]
Got shiny diamonds
Like the eyes of a cat in the black and blue
Something is coming for you, look out!
Race for the morning
You can hide in the sun 'till you see the light
Oh we will pray it's all right

[Chorus]
Gotta get away, get away

[Bridge]
Between the velvet lies
There's a truth that's hard as steel, yeah
The vision never dies
Life's a never-ending wheel, say

[Verse 3]
Holy Diver
You're the star of the masquerade
No need to look so afraid
Jump, jump, jump on the tiger
You can feel his heart but you know he's mean
Some light can never be seen, yeah!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Holy Diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh what's becoming of me? No! No!
Ride the tiger
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh don't you see what I mean?

[Chorus]
Gotta get away, get away
Gotta get away, get away, yeah

[Outro]
Holy Diver, sole survivor
You're the one who's clean
Holy Diver, Holy Diver
There's a cat in the blue coming after you, Holy Diver

Oh Holy Diver
Yeah, alright
Get away, get away, get away
Holy Diver, Holy Diver
Oh Holy Diver
Hmmm hmm hmm



When there's lightning
You know it always brings me down
Cause it's free and I see that it's me
Who's lost and never found

I cry out for magic
I feel it dancing in the light
It was cold, lost my hold
To the shadows of the night

No sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark
A rainbow in the dark

Do your Demons, do they ever let you go?
When you've tried, do they hide deep inside?
Is it someone that you know?
You're just a picture
You're an image caught in time
We're a lie, you and I
We're words without a rhyme

There's no sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark
Just a rainbow in the dark

When I see lightning
You know it always brings me down
Cause it's free and I see that it's me
Who's lost and never found

Feel the magic
I feel it floating in the air
But it's fear and you'll hear it calling
You beware, look out

There's no sign of the morning coming
There's no sign of the day
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow, like a rainbow in the dark
You're a rainbow in the dark
Just a rainbow in the dark
No sign of the morning
You're a rainbow in the dark

Whoahoohwhoaoohwhoaohhhhh



We're a ship without a storm
The cold without the warm
Light inside the darkness that it needs, yeah...
We're a laugh without a tear
The hope without the fear
We are coming...home!

We're off to the witch
We may never never never come home
But the magic that we'll feel is worth a lifetime
We're all born upon the cross
We're the throw before the toss
You can release yourself
But the only way is down

We don't come alone
We are fire, we are stone
We're the hand that writes
And quickly moves away

We'll know for the first time
If we're evil or divine
We're the last in line, yeah
We're the last in line, oh!

Two eyes from the east
It's the Angel or the Beast
And the answer lies between the good and bad
We search for the truth
We could die upon the tooth
But the thrill of just the chase is worth the pain

We'll know for the first time
If we're evil or divine
We're the last in line
We're the last in line

We're off to the witch
We may never never never come home
But the magic that we'll feel is worth a lifetime

We're all born upon the cross
You know we're the throw before the toss
You can release yourself
But the only way to go is down

We'll know for the first time
If we're evil or divine
We're the last in line
We're the last in line
See all we shine
We're the last in, we're the last in
We're the last in, we're the last in
We're the last in, we're the first in line

We're a ship without a storm
We're the cold inside the warm
We're a laugh without a tear
We're the far without the near

We're the last in line
We're the last in line
We're the last in line
See how we shine
We're the last in line



These mist covered mountains
Are a home now for me
But my home is the lowlands
And always will be

Some day you'll return to
Your valleys and your farms
And you'll no longer burn
To be brothers in arms

Through these fields of destruction
Baptism of fire
I've witnessed your suffering
As the battle raged high
And though they did hurt me so bad
In the fear and alarm
You did not desert me
My brothers in arms

There's so many different worlds
So many different suns
And we have just one world
But we live in different ones

Now the sun's gone to hell
And the moon's riding high
Let me bid you farewell
Every man has to die

But it's written in the starlight
And every line in your palm
We're fools to make war
On our brothers in arms



[Verse 1]
Sweet surrender on the Quayside
You remember we used to run and hide
In the shadow of the cargoes
I take you one at a time
And we're counting all the numbers
Down to the waterline

[Verse 2]
Well, near misses on the dogleap stairways
French kisses in the darkened doorways
A foghorn blowing out wild and cold
A policeman, he shines a light upon my shoulder

[Verse 3]
Up comes a coaster fast and silent in the night
Over my shoulder all you can see
Are the pilot lights
No money in our jackets and our jeans are torn
Your hands are cold but your lips are warm

[Verse 4]
She can see him on the jetty that
They used to know
She can feel him in the places where
The sailors go
When she's walking by the river
Or the railway line
She can still hear him whisper
Let's go down to the waterline, c'mon



[Verse 1]
She gets the sun in the daytime
Perfume in the dusk
And she comes out in the night time
With the honeysuckle musk
Because she smells just like a rose
And she tastes just like a peach
She got me walking where the wildlife goes
I'd do anything to reach her

[Chorus]
And she was made in heaven
Heaven's in the world
Oh she was made in heaven
Heaven's in the world
Is this just expresso love
You know I'm crazy for the girl
Just crazy for the girl

[Verse 2]
She call me just to talk
She's my lover, she's a friend of mine
She says. "Hey mister you wanna take a walk
In the wild west end sometime?"
And I get trouble with my breathing
When she says boys don't know anything
But I know what I want
Yes, I want everything

[Chorus]
Cause she was made in heaven
And heaven's in the world
Oh she was made in heaven
Yes, heaven's in the world
Is this just expresso love
See I'm crazy for the girl
Just crazy for the girl

[Bridge]
Well I feel so good because I feel so good
And I feel so good because it feels so right
I was made to go with my girl
Just like a saxophone was made to go with the night

[Verse 3]
And she can raise one eyebrow
Put her hand on my hip
And I close one eye now
Sweat on her lip
Oh and I surrender to the fever
And I surrender to the will of the night
She love me so tender I got to believe her
Love? Expresso love's alright now

[Chorus]
Cause she was made in heaven
And heaven's in the world
Oh she was made in heaven
Yes, heaven's in the world
Is this just expresso love
Know I'm crazy for the girl
Just crazy for the girl

[Outro]
I don't want no sugar in it
Thank you very much
All wired up on it, all fired up on it
Expresso touch
Hey maestro, expresso now
Hey maestro, she said expresso now
It's just another one, just like the other one
It's just another one, just like the other one oh one
Hey maestro, expresso now
I said hey maestro, expresso
I need another one
[Music fades]



[Verse 1]
Warning lights are flashing down at Quality Control
Somebody threw a spanner and they threw him in the hole
There's rumors in the loading bay and anger in the town
Somebody blew the whistle and the walls came down
There's a meeting in the boardroom they're trying to trace the smell
There's leaking in the washroom there's a sneak in personnel
Somewhere in the corridors someone was heard to sneeze
Goodness me, could this be industrial disease?
The caretaker was crucified for sleeping at his post
They're refusing to be pacified it's him they blame the most
The watchdog's got rabies the foreman's got fleas
And everyone's concerned about industrial disease

[Verse 2]
There's panic on the switchboard tongues are ties in knots
Some come out in sympathy some come out in spots
Some blame the management some the employees
And everybody knows it's the industrial disease
Yeah, now the work force is disgusted downs tools and walks
Innocence is injured experience just talks
Everyone seeks damages and everyone agrees
That these are 'classic symptoms of a monetary squeeze'
On ITV and BBC they talk about the curse
Philosophy is useless theology is worse
History boils over there's an economics freeze
Sociologists invent words that mean 'industrial disease'

[Verse 3]
Doctor Parkinson declared "I'm not surprised to see you here
You've got smoker's cough from smoking, brewer's droop from drinking beer
I don't know how you came to get the Betty Davis' knees
But worst of all young man you've got industrial disease"
He wrote me a prescription he said "You are depressed
But I'm glad you came to see me to get this off your chest
Come back and see me later - next patient please
Send in another victim of industrial disease"

[Verse 4]
And I go down to Speaker's Corner I'm thunderstruck
They got free speech, tourists, police in trucks
Two men say they're Jesus one of them must be wrong
There's a protest singer, He's singing a protest song - he says
They want to have a war to keep their factories
They want to have a war to keep us on our knees
They want to have a war to stop us buying Japanese
They want to have a war to stop Industrial Disease
They're pointing out the enemy to keep you deaf and blind
They want to sap your energy incarcerate your mind
Give you Rule Brittania, gassy beer, page three
Two weeks in Espana and Sunday striptease'
Meanwhile the first Jesus says "I'd cure it soon
Abolish Monday mornings and Friday afternoons"
The other one's on a hunger strike he's dying by degrees
How come Jesus gets industrial disease



[Verse 1]
Lady writer on the TV
Talking about the Virgin Mary
Reminded me of you
Expectation left to come up to, yeah
Lady writer on the TV
Yeah, she had another quality
The way you used to look
And I know you never read a book

[Chorus]
Just the way that her hair fell down around her face
And I recall my fall from grace
Another time, another place

[Verse 2]
Lady writer on the TV
She had all the brains and the beauty
The picture does not fit
You'd talk to me when you felt like it

[Chorus]
Just the way that her hair fell down around her face
And I recall my fall from grace
Another time, another place

[Bridge]
Yes and your rich old man
You know he'd a call her a dead ringer
You got the same command
Plus your mother was a Jazz singer

[Chorus]
Just the way that her hair fell down around her face
And I recall my fall from grace
Oh, yeah
Another time, another place

[Verse 3]
Lady writer on the TV
She knew all about a history
You couldn't hardly write your name
I think I want you just the same as the
Lady writer on the TV (lady writer on the TV)

[Outro]
Talking about the Virgin Mary (lady writer)
Yeah you know I'm talking about you and me (lady writer on the TV)
And the lady writer on the TV
Lady writer on the TV (lady writer on the TV)
Talking about the Virgin Mary (lady writer)
Yeah you know I'm talking about you and me (lady writer on the TV)
And the lady writer on the TV
Lady writer on the TV
Lady writer
Lady writer on the TV
Lady writer on the TV
Lady writer
Lady writer on the TV
Lady writer on the TV
Lady writer

Bangin' on the bongos like a chimpanzee

A lovestruck Romeo sings the streets a serenade
Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
Finds a streetlight steps out of the shade
Says something like, You and me babe, how about it?

Juliet says, Hey it's Romeo you nearly gimme a heart attack
He's underneath the window she's singing, Hey la my boyfriend's back
You shoudn't come around here singing up at people like that
Anyway what you gonna do about it?

Juliet the dice were loaded from the start
And I bet when you exploded in my heart
And I forget I forget the movie song
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong? Juliet

Come up on different streets they both were streets of shame
Both dirty both mean yes and the dream was just the same
And I dreamed your dream for you and now your dream is real
How can you look at me as I was just another one of your deals?

Well you can fall for chains of silver you can fall for chains of gold
You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold
You promised me everything you promised me thick and thin
Now you just say, Oh Romeo yeah you know I used to have a scene with him

Juliet when we made love you used to cry
You said I love you like the stars above I'll love you till I die
There's a place for us, you know the movie song
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong? Juliet

I can't do the talk like they talking on the TV
And I can't do a love song like the way its meant to be
I can't do everything but I'd do anything for you
I can't do anything except be in love with you

And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be
All I do is keep the beat and bad company
All I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme
Juliet I'd do the stars with you any time

Juliet when we made love you used to cry
You said I love you like the stars above I'll love you till I die
There's a place for us you know the movie song
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong? Juliet

A lovestruck Romeo sings the streets a serenade
Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
Finds a convenient streetlight steps out of the shade
Says something like you and me babe how about it
How about it



[Verse 1]
Here I am again in this mean old town
And you're so far away from me
And where are you when the sun goes down?
You're so far away from me

[Chorus]
You're so far away from me
You're so far I just can't see
You're so far away from me
You're so far away from me, alright

[Verse 2]
I'm tired of being in love and being all alone
When you're so far away from me
I'm tired of making out on the telephone
Cause you're so far away from me

[Chorus]
You're so far away from me
You're so far I just can't see
You're so far away from me
You're so far away from me, alright

[Verse 3]
And I get so tired when I have to explain
That you're so far away from me
See, you've been in the sun, and I've been in the rain
And you're so far away from me

[Chorus]
You're so far away from me
You're so far I just can't see
You're so far away from me
You're so far away from me, take it down

...so far away...
You're so far away from me
Alright
I 'm so far away from you



[Verse 1]
Well take a look at that
I made a castle in the sand
Saying this is where it's you know
Couldn't understand now
If I realised that the chances were slim
How come I'm so surprised when the tide rolled in

[Chorus]
I'm going to live on solid rock
I'm going to live on solid rock
I want to give I don't want to be blocked
I'm going to live on solid rock

[Verse 2]
Well I'm sick of potential
I'm sick of vanity now
I'm sticking to essential reality now
I don't know what's worse
Try to make a silk purse
Living an illusion living in confusion

[Chorus]
I'm going to live on solid rock
I'm going to live on solid rock
I want to give I don't want to be blocked
I'm going to live on solid rock

[Verse 3]
Well a house of cards
Was never built for shock
You could blow it down in any kind of weather
Now two solid rocks two solid blocks
You know they're going to stick
Yeah they're going to stick together

[Bridge]
Because the heart that you break
That's the one that you rely on
The bed that you make
That's the one you got to lie on
When you point your finger because your plan fell through
You got three more fingers pointing back at you

[Chorus]
I'm going to live on solid rock
I'm going to live on solid rock
I want to give I don't want to be blocked
I'm going to live on solid rock

[Outro]
I'm solid rock now[repeat until fade]



[Verse 1]
You get a shiver in the dark
It's raining in the park
But meantime
South of the river
You stop and you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie
Double four time
You feel alright
When you hear that music ring

[Verse 2]
Well, now you step inside
But you don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down
Competition in other places
But the horns, they blowin' that sound
Way on down south
Way on down south, London town

[Verse 3]
Check out guitar George
He knows all the chords
Mind, it's strictly rhythm
He doesn't want to make it cry or sing
Left-handed old guitar is all he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing

[Verse 4]
And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
He's got a daytime job – He's doing alright
He can play the honky tonk like anything
Saving it up for Friday night
With the Sultans
With the Sultans of Swing

[Verse 5]
And a crowd of young boys
They're fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies
And their platform soles
They don't give a damn
About any trumpet playing band
It ain't what they call Rock and Roll
And the Sultans
Yeah, the Sultans, they play Creole
Creole

[Instrumental Solo]

[Verse 6]
And then the man
He steps right up to the microphone
And says at last
Just as the time bell rings
"Goodnight, now it's time to go home"
Then he makes it fast
With one more thing
"We are the Sultans –
We are the Sultans of Swing"



[Verse 1]
Here comes Johnny singing oldies, goldies
Be-Bop-A-Lula, Baby What I Say
Here comes Johnny singing I Got a Woman
Down in the tunnels, trying to make it pay
He got the action, he got the motion
Yeah, the boy can play
Dedication devotion
Turning all the night time into the day

[Chorus]
He do the song about the sweet lovin' woman
He do the song about the knife
He do the walk, he do the walk of life

[Verse 2]
Here comes Johnny and he'll tell you the story
Hand me down my walkin' shoes
Here come Johnny with the power and the glory
Backbeat the talkin' blues
He got the action, he got the motion
Yeah, the boy can play
Dedication devotion
Turning all the night time into the day

[Chorus]
He do the song about the sweet lovin' woman
He do the song about the knife
He do the walk, he do the walk of life

[Verse 1]
Here comes Johnny singing oldies, goldies
Be-Bop-A-Lula, Baby What I Say
Here comes Johnny singing I Gotta Woman
Down in the tunnels, trying to make it pay
He got the action, he got the motion
Yeah, the boy can play
Dedication devotion
Turning all the night time into the day

[Outro]
And after all the violence and double talk
There's just a song in the trouble and the strife
You do the walk, you do the walk of life



[Verse 1]
Must have been mid afternoon
I could tell by how far the child's shadow stretched out
And he walked with a purpose in his sneakers down the street
He had many questions like children often do

[Chorus]
We said, tell me all your thoughts on God
Tell me am I very far?

[Verse 2]
Must have been late afternoon
On our way the sun broke free of the clouds
We count only blue cars, skip the cracks in the street
And ask many questions like children often do

[Chorus]
We said, tell me all your thoughts on God
Cause I would really like to meet her
And ask her why we're who we are
Tell me all your thoughts on God
Cause I am on my way to see her
So tell me am I very far, am I very far now?

[Verse 3]
It's getting cold picked up the pace
How our shoes make hard noises in this place
Our clothes are stained
We pass many cross-eyed people
And ask many questions like children often do

[Chorus]
Tell me all your thoughts on God
Cause I would really like to meet her
And ask her why we're who we are
Tell me all your thoughts on God
Cause I am on my way to see her
So tell me am I very far
Am I very far now, am I very far now, am I very far now?
Tell me all your thoughts on God



Day after day I'm more confused
Yet I look for the light through the pouring rain
You know that's a game that I hate to lose
And I'm feelin' the strain
Ain't it a shame

[Chorus]
Oh, give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Oh, give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away

Beginning to think that I'm wastin' time
I don't understand the things I do
The world outside looks so unkind
And I'm countin' on you
To carry me through

[Chorus]

And when my mind is free
You know a melody can move me
And when I'm feelin' blue
The guitar's comin' through to soothe me

Thanks for the joy that you've given me
I want you to know I believe in your song
And rhythm and rhyme and harmony
You've helped me along
Makin' me strong

[Chorus] x 2

Na na na, won't you, won't you take me
Oh, take me



I'd like to see you in the morning light
I'd like to feel you when it comes tonight
Now I'm here and I'm all alone
Still I know how it feels
I'm alone again

Tried so hard to make you see
But I couldn't find the words
Now the tears, they fall like rain
I'm alone again without you
Alone again without you
Alone again without you
Alone again without you

I said stay, but you turned away
Tried to say that it was me
Now I'm here and I've lost my way
Now I know how it feels
I'm alone again

Repeat CHORUS

(bridge)
I...
Repeat CHORUS



In my dreams
It's still the same
Your love is strong
It still remains

Toss and turn all night
In the sheets
But I can't sleep
Night after night
Don't know what it means
In my dreams

What can I say or do
You won't come back
We're through
I've realized too late
That, baby, your love has turned away

In my dreams
It's still the same
Your love is strong
It still remains
In my dreams
You're still by me
Just the way it used to be

Calling your name
But you're turning away
Please don't leave
Running in circles
Waiting to see you
In my dreams

What can I say or do
You won't come back
We're through
I've realized too late
That, baby, your love has turned away

In my dreams
It's still the same
Your love is strong
It still remains
In my dreams
You're still by me
Just the way it used to be

In my dreams
It's still the same
Your love is strong
It still remains
In my dreams
You're still by me
Just the way it used to be

In my dreams
It's still the same
Your love is strong
It still remains
In my dreams
You'll always be
In my heart and
In my dreams

In my dreams
It's still the same
In my dreams
You're still by me
In my dreams
Just the way it used to be

In my dreams
What can I say
In my dreams
You're still by me
And in my dreams
You'll always be
In my dreams
You'll always be
In my dreams
Your love is strong
In my dreams
You're still the same
In my dreams



You weave your spell
Your eyes they beckon me
Your lips they speak, lies and misery
I know it's wrong, but I can't turn away
The flames draw near, they're telling me to stay

(Into the fire) I'm falling
(Into the fire) I'm falling
Into the fire

Your love burns bright, and yet the flames are cold
This time I fear, you won't be back no more
When will it end, your love consumes my soul
Into the fire, I'm being tempted once more

(Into the fire) I'm falling
(Into the fire) I'm falling
Into the fire

Take me back where I came from
Don't wanna see your face no more
You broke my heart, now it's not the same
I'm falling, again
I'm falling, again
Into the fire



[Verse 1]
Head bangers in leather
Sparks flyin in the dead of the night
It all comes together
When they turn out the lights
50,000 watts of power
And it's pushin' overload
The beast is ready to devour
All the metal they can hold
Rockin' overload
Start to explode

[Chorus]
It's your one way ticket to midnight
Call it Heavy Metal
Higher than high, feelin' just right
Call it Heavy Metal
Desperation on a red line
Call it Heavy Metal noise

[Verse 2]
Tight pants and lipstick
She's riding on razor's edge
She holds her own against the boys
Yea, cuts through the crowd just like a wedge
Ohh, can you feel the static
So many contacts being made
We've got up front fanatics
Tearing down the barricade
To reach the stage
Can you feel the rage

[Chorus]
It's your one way ticket to midnight
Call it Heavy Metal
Higher than high, feelin' just right
Call it Heavy Metal
Desperation on a red line
Call it Heavy Metal noise



They're pickin' up the prisoners
And putting 'em in a pen
And all she wants to do is dance, dance

Rebels been rebels
Since I don't know when
And all she wants to do is dance

Molotov cocktail, the local drink
And all she wants to do is dance, dance

They mix 'em up right
In the kitchen sink
And all she wants to do is dance

Crazy people walkin' round
With blood in their eyes
And all she wants to do is dance, dance, dance

Wild-eyed pistol-wavers
Who ain't afraid to die
And all she wants to do is

All she wants to do is dance
And make romance
She can't feel the heat
Comin off the street
She wants to party
She wants to get down
All she wants to do is
All she wants to do is dance

Well the government bugged the men's room
In the local disco lounge
And all she wants to do is dance, dance

To keep the boys from sellin'
All the weapons they could scrounge
And all she wants to do is dance

But that don't keep the boys
From makin' a buck or two
And all she wants to do is dance, dance

They still can sell the army
All the drugs that they can do
And all she wants to do is

All she wants to do is dance
And make romance

Well, we barely made the airport
For the last plane out
As we taxied down the runway
I could hear the people shout
They said, "Don't come back here, Yankee"
But if I ever do
I'll bring more money

'Cause all she wants to do is dance
And make romance
Never mind the heat
Comin' off the street
She wants to party
She wants to get down
All she wants to do is
All she wants to do is dance
And make romance
All she wants to do is dance



I make my living off the evening news
Just give me something, something I can use
People love it when you lose
They love dirty laundry

Well, I coulda' been an actor, but I wound up here
I just have to look good, I don't have to be clear
Come and whisper in my ear
Give us dirty laundry

Kick 'em when they're up
Kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're up
Kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're up
Kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're up
Kick 'em all around

We got the bubble-headed bleached-blonde
Comes on at five
She can tell you 'bout the plane crash
With a gleam in her eye
It's interesting when people die
Give us dirty laundry

Can we film the operation?
Is the head dead yet?
You know, the boys in the newsroom
Got a running bet
Get the widow on the set!
We need dirty laundry

You don't really need to find out what's going on
You don't really want to know just how far it's gone
Just leave well enough alone
Eat your dirty laundry

Kick 'em when they're up
Kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're up
Kick 'em when they're down

Kick 'em when they're up
Kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're stiff
Kick 'em all around

Dirty little secrets
Dirty little lies
We got our dirty little fingers in everybody's pies
We love to cut you down to size
We love dirty laundry

We can do "The Innuendo"
We can dance and sing
When it's said and done we haven't told you a thing
We all know that crap is king
Give us dirty laundry!



[Verse 1]
Let's go down to the Sunset Grill
We can watch the working girls go by
Watch the basket people walk around and mumble
Stare out at the auburn sky

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There's an old man there from the old world
To him, it's all the same
Calls all his customers by name

[Chorus]
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill

[Verse 2]
You see a lot more meanness in the city
It's the kind that eats you up inside
Hard to come away with anything that feels like dignity
Hard to get home with any pride

[Pre-Chorus 2]
These days a man makes you somethin'
And you never see his face
But there is no hiding place

[Chorus]
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill

[Bridge]
Respectable little murders pay
They get more respectable every day
Don't worry, girl
I'm gonna stick by you
And someday soon
We're gonna get in that car
And get outta here

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
Let's go down to the Sunset Grill
Watch the working girls go by
Watch the basket people walk around and mumble
Gaze out at the auburn sky

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Maybe we'll leave come springtime
Meanwhile, have another beer
What would we do without all these jerks anyway?
Besides, all our friends are here

[Chorus]
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill

[Instrumental]



[Verse 1]
Nobody on the road
Nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air
The summer's out of reach
Empty lake, empty streets
The sun goes down alone
I'm driving by your house
Though I know
You're not home

[Chorus 1]
But I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got your hair combed back and your
Sunglasses on baby
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

[Verse 2]
I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy
Remember how I made you scream
Now I don't understand
What happened to our love
But babe I'm gonna get you back
I'm going to show you what I'm made of

[Chorus 2]
I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
I see you walking real slow
Smiling at everyone
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

[Verse 3]
Out on the road today
I saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice inside my head said
"Don't look back, you can never look back"
I thought I knew what love was
What did I know
Those days are gone forever
I should just let them go but...

[Chorus 3]
I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got the top pulled down
Radio on, baby
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

[Chorus 4]
I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got your hair slicked back and those
Wayfarers on, baby
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone



I got the call today, I didn't wanna hear
But I knew that it would come
An old true friend of ours was talking on the phone
She said you found someone
And I thought of all the bad luck
And the struggles we went through
And how I lost me and you lost you
What are these voices outside love's open door
Make us throw off our contentment
And beg for something more?

I'm learning to live without you now
But I miss you sometimes
The more I know, the less I understand
All the things I thought I knew, I'm learning again
I've been trying to get down to the heart of the matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think it's about forgiveness, forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me anymore

These times are so uncertain
There's a yearning undefined
And people filled with rage
We all need a little tenderness
How can love survive in such a graceless age?
The trust and self-assurance that lead to happiness
They're the very things we kill, I guess
Pride and competition cannot fill these empty arms
And the work I put between us
You know it doesn't keep me warm

I'm learning to live without you now
But I miss you, baby
The more I know, the less I understand
All the things I thought I figured out, I have to learn again
I've been trying to get down to the heart of the matter
But everything changes
And my friends seem to scatter
But I think it's about forgiveness, forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me anymore

There are people in your life who've come and gone
They let you down, you know they hurt your pride
You better put it all behind you, baby, cause life goes on
You keep carrying that anger, it'll eat you up inside, baby

I've been trying to get down to the heart of the matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think it's about forgiveness, forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me

I've been trying to get down to the heart of the matter
Because the flesh will get weak
And the ashes will scatter
So I'm thinking about forgiveness, forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me

Forgiveness
(Yeah)
Forgiveness
(Baby)
Forgiveness
(Oh, oh)
Forgiveness
(Ah, yeah)
Forgiveness
(Oh)
Forgiveness
Even if you don't love me anymore

Forgiveness
(Oh)
Forgiveness
(Oh)
Forgiveness
Forgiveness



[Verse 1]
I know you broke up with him
And your heart's still on the shelf
It's been over two years for me
And I'm still not quite myself
You can't be with someone new
And you can't go back to him
You're beginning to realize
That it's sink or swim

I see you around sometimes
And my heart just melts
You're lookin' like if you had your wish
You'd be somewhere else
And it just breaks my heart
To see you here this way
Someday I'll get the nerve
To walk up to you and say

[Chorus 1]
This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend
Just gimme a chance
To show you how to love again
This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend
Cause I'll be there
When your broken heart is on the mend

[Verse 2]
Every night it's the same old crowd in smoky rooms
You catch a faint glimpse of love sometimes
But it never blooms
I've been around this block a time or two
And I've made some big mistakes
But girl I promise you, I promise you

[Chorus 2]
This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend
Just gimme a chance
To show you how to love again
This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend
Cause it won't be long
Til your little heart is on the mend

[Bridge]
(time, time, tickin, tickin, tickin away)
(time, time, tickin, tickin, tickin)
(time, time, tickin, tickin, tickin away)
(time, time, tickin, tickin, tickin)

[Verse 3]
People inside their houses
With the shades pulled down
God knows we could use some romance
In this sleepy bedroom town
I know you're still afraid to rush into anything
But there are just so many summers, babe
And just so many springs

[Chorus 2]
And this is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend, baby
Just gimme a chance, gimme a chance
To show you love again
This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend
Cause it won't be long
Til your little heart is on the mend

That you'll have to spend
Just gimme a chance, darlin
To show you how to love again
This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend 'cause it won't be long
Til your little heart is on the mend



[Verse 1]
A long, long time ago...
I can still remember
How that music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And, maybe, they’d be happy for a while
But February made me shiver
With every paper I’d deliver
Bad news on the doorstep;
I couldn’t take one more step
I can’t remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died

[Chorus]
So bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
Singing, "This’ll be the day that I die
"This’ll be the day that I die."

[Verse 2]
Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock ’n' roll
Can music save your mortal soul
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?
Well, I know that you’re in love with him
`cause I saw you dancin’ in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues
I was a lonely teenage broncin’ buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singing

[Chorus]
Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
Singing, "This’ll be the day that I die
"This’ll be the day that I die."

[Verse 3]
Now for ten years we’ve been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rollin’ stone
But that’s not how it used to be
When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me
Oh, and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned;
No verdict was returned
And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singing

[Chorus]
Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
Singing, "This’ll be the day that I die
"This’ll be the day that I die."

[Verse 4]
Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast
It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast
Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While the sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance!
`cause the players tried to take the field;
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singing

[Chorus]
Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
Singing, "This’ll be the day that I die
"This’ll be the day that I die."

[Verse 5]
Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again
So come on: Jack be nimble, Jack be quick!
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
Cause fire is the devil’s only friend
Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in hell
Could break that Satan’s spell
And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
We were singing

[Chorus]
Bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
Singing, "This’ll be the day that I die
"This’ll be the day that I die."

[Verse 6]
I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
I went down to the sacred store
Where I’d heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn’t play
And in the streets: the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken;
The church bells all were broken
And the three men I admire most:
The father, son, and the holy ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

[Deleted Verse]
And there I stood alone and afraid
I dropped to my knees and there I prayed
And I promised him everything I could give
If only he would make the music live
And he promised it would live once more
But this time one would equal four
And in five years four had come to mourn
And the music was reborn

[Chorus]
Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
Singing, "This’ll be the day that I die
"This’ll be the day that I die."
They were singing
Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
Singing, "This’ll be the day that I die"



Leah
It's been a long, long time
You're such a sight
You're looking better than a body has a right to
Don't you know we're playing with the fire
But we can stop this burning desire
Leah

Ah! Leah!
Here we go again
Ah! Leah!
Is it ever gonna end?
Ah! Leah!
Here we go again
Ah! Leah!

I see your lips
And I wonder who's been kissing them
I never knew how badly I was missing them
We both know we're never going to make it
But when we touch
We never have to fake it
Leah

Ah! Leah!
Here we go again
Ah! Leah!
Is it ever gonna end?
Ah! Leah!
Here we go again
Ah! Leah!
We ain't learned our lesson yet

Baby, it's no good
We're just asking for trouble
I can touch you
But I don't know how to love you

It ain't no use
We're headed for disaster
Our minds said no
But our hearts were talking faster
Leah

Ah! Leah!
Here we go again
Ah! Leah!
Here we go again
Ah! Leah!
Leah, Leah, Leah
Ah! Leah!
Here we go again

Ah! Leah!
Leah
We're never, ever, ever gonna make it, yeah
Ah! Leah!
Here we go again
Ah! Leah!
We're never gonna make it
Ah! Leah!

You can't depend on politicians
You can't depend on superstitions

Love can rock you
Never stop you
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Love is like a rock

You can't rely on Mother Nature
You can't rely on your paychecks
You can't depend on your doctor
You can't depend on your lawyer

Love is like a rock

Love can rock you
Never stop you
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Love is like a rock



{Intro}

When I look out my window
Many sights to see
And when I look in my window
So many different people to be
That it's strange, so strange

You've got to pick up every stitch
You've got to pick up every stitch
You've got to pick up every stitch
Mmm, must be the season of the witch
Must be the season of the witch, yeah
Must be the season of the witch

When I look over my shoulder
What do you think I see?
Some other cat looking over
His shoulder at me
And he's strange, very very very strange

You've got to pick up every stitch
You've got to pick up every stitch
Beatniks are out to make it rich
Oh no, must be the season of the witch
Must be the season of the witch, yeah
Must be the season of the witch

You've got to pick up every stitch
The rabbits running in the ditch
Beatniks are out to make it rich
Oh no must be the season
Oh no, must be the season of the witch
Must be the season of the witch
Must be the season of the witch

When I look out my window
What do you think I see?
And when I look in my window
So many different people to be
It's strange, sure is strange
You've got to pick up every stitch
You've got to pick up every stitch
The rabbits running in the ditch
Oh no, must be the season
Oh no, must be the season
Oh no, must be the season of the witch

When I look, when I look

Sunshine came softly through my a-window today
Could've tripped out easy a-but I've a-changed my ways
It'll take time, I know it but in a while
You're gonna be mine, I know it, we'll do it in style
Cause I made my mind up you're going to be mine

I'll tell you right now
Any trick in the book now, baby, all that I can find
Everybody's hustlin' just to have a little scene
When I say we'll be cool I think that you know what I mean
We stood on a beach at sunset, do you remember when?
I know a beach where, baby, a-it never ends
When you've made your mind up forever to be mine

Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
I'll pick up your hand and slowly blow your little mind
Cause I made my mind up you're going to be mine
I'll tell you right now
Any trick in the book now, baby, all that I can find

Superman or Green Lantern ain't got a-nothin' on me
I can make like a turtle and dive for your pearls in the sea, yeah!
A you-you-you can just sit there a-thinking on your velvet throne
'bout all the rainbows a-you can a-have for your own
When you've made your mind up forever to be mine
I'll pick up your hand and slowly blow your little mind
When you've made your mind up forever to be mine

I'll pick up your hand
I'll pick up your hand



Ha, ha, ha, I don't believe it
Da, da, ah, ooh, don't touch me
Hey, Ray!
Hey, Sugar!
Tell 'em who we are

Well, we're big rock singers
We've got golden fingers
And we're loved everywhere we go (That sounds like us)
We sing about beauty
And we sing about truth
For ten thousand dollars a show (Right!)

We take all kind of pills
That give us all kind of thrills
But the thrill we've never known
Is the thrill that'll get ya
When you get your picture
On the cover of the Rolling Stone

(Rolling Stone) Wanna see my picture on the cover
(Stone) Wanna buy five copies for my mother (Yeah!)
(Stone) Wanna see my smilin' face
On the cover of the Rolling Stone (That's a very, very, good idea!)

I got a freaky ol' lady name o' Cocaine Katy
Who embroiders on my jeans
I got my poor old gray-haired daddy
Drivin' my limousine

Now, it's all designed to blow our minds
But our minds won't really be blown
Like the blow that'll get ya when you get your picture
On the cover of the Rolling Stone

(Rolling Stone) Wanna see our pictures on the cover
(Stone) Wanna buy five copies for our mothers (yeah)
(Stone) Wanna see my smilin' face
On the cover of the Rolling Stone

(Hey, I know how, rock and roll!!)

(Ah, that's beautiful)

We got a lot of little teenage blue-eyed groupies
Who do anything we say
We got a genuine Indian guru
Who's teaching us a better way

We got all the friends that money can buy
So we never have to be alone
And we keep getting richer but we can't get our picture
On the cover of the Rolling Stone

(Rolling Stone) Wanna see my picture on the cover
(Stone) Wanna buy five copies for my mother (I want one!)
(Stone) Wanna see my smilin' face
On the cover of the Rolling Stone
On the cover of the Rolling Stone

Wanna see my picture on the cover
(Man, I don't know why we ain't on the cover, Baby)
(We're beautiful people)
Wanna buy five copies for my mother
(I ain't kiddin', why, we would make a beautiful cover
(Fresh shot, right up front, man)
On the cover of the Rolling Stone
(I can see it now, we'll be up on the front)
(Smilin', man ...... ahh, beautiful!)



{Intro}

I been in the right place, but it must have been the wrong time
I'd have said the right thing, but I must have used the wrong line
I been in the right trip, but I must have used the wrong car
My head was in a bad place and I'm wondering what it's good for
I been the right place, but it must have been the wrong time
My head was in a bad place, but I'm having such a good time

I been running trying to get hung up in my mind (oooh)
Got to give myself a good talking-to this time
Just need a little brain salad surgery (oooh)
Got to cure this insecurity

I been in the wrong place, but it must have been the right time
I been in the right place, but it must have been the wrong song
I been in the right vein, but it seems like the wrong arm
I been in the right world, but it seems wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong

{Bridge}

Slipping, dodging, sneaking, creeping, hiding out down the street (oooh)
See me life shaking with every ho' I meet
Refried confusion is making itself clear (oooh)
Wonder which way do I go to get on out of here

I been in the right place, but it must have been the wrong time
I'd have said the right thing, but I must have used the wrong line
I'd have took the right road, but I must have took a wrong turn
Would've made the right move, but I made it at the wrong time
I been on the right road but, I must have used the wrong car
My head was in a good place and I wonder what it's bad for



[Verse 1]
Okay, what is it tonight?
At least just tell me what the hell is wrong
Do you want to eat, do you want to sleep?
Do you want to drown?
Just settle down, settle down, settle down...

[Chorus]
I'll give you give candy, give you diamonds, give you pills
Give you anything you want, hundred dollar bills
I'll even let you watch the shows you want to see
Just marry me, marry me, marry me...

[Verse 2]
I'm so sick of you tonight
You never stay awake when I get home
Is something wrong with me, something wrong with you?
I really wish I knew, wish I knew, wish I knew...

[Chorus]
I'll give you candy, give you diamonds, give you pills
Give you anything you want, hundred dollar bills
I'll even let you watch the shows you want to see
Because you married me, married me, married me...

[Bridge]
I was young I learned a game
That love and happiness were the same
Now I'm older and I don't play
I found out the hardest way
I got wasted, she got mad
Called me names and she called her dad
He got crazy and I did too
Wondered what I did to you

[Chorus]
I'll gave you candy, gave you diamonds, gave you pills
I gave you anything you want, hundred dollar bills
I even let you hear the songs I want to sing
I'll give you anything, anything, anything
I'll give you anything, anything, anything
I'll give you anything, anything, anything
Anything, anything, anything



[Verse 1]
Want to tell you about the girl I love
My, she looks so fine
She's the only one that I been dreaming of
Maybe someday she will be all mine
I want to tell her that I love her so
I thrill with her every touch
I need to tell her she's the only one I really love

[Chorus]
I got a woman, want to bawl all day
I got a woman, she won't be true, no
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time
I said, I got a little woman, and she won't be true

[Verse 2]
Sunday morning, when we go down to church
See the menfolk standing in line
Say they come to pray to the Lord
When my little girl looks so fine
In the evening, when the sun is sinking low
Everybody's with the one they love
I walk the town
Keep a-searching all around
Looking for my street corner girl

[Chorus]
I got a woman, want to bawl all day, yeah
I got a woman, she won't be true, no, no
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time
I said, I got a little woman, and she won't be true

[Verse 3]
In the bars, with the men who play guitars
Singing, drinking, and remembering the times
My little lover does a midnight shift
She followed around all of the time
I guess there's just one thing a-left for me to do
Going to pack my bags and move on my way
Cause I got a worried mind
Sharing what I thought was mine
Going to leave her where the guitars play

[Chorus]
I got a woman, she won't be true, no, no
I got a woman, want to bawl all day, yeah, yeah, naw, naw
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time
I got a little woman, and she won't be true

[Outro]
(Hey, hey, what can I do?)
I said she won't be true, naw
Yeah, no, yeah, no
(No, no, what can I say?)
Yeah, no, yeah, no
(Hey, hey, what can I do?)
Oh, keep on, keep on, keep on
(No, no, what can I say?)
Keep on, keep on, keep on
(Hey, hey, what can I do?)



[Verse 1]
Moving on the floor now babe you're a bird of paradise
Cherry ice cream smile I suppose it's very nice
With a step to your left
And a flick to the right you catch that mirror way out west
You know you're something special and you look like you're the best

[Chorus]
Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand
Just like that river twisting through a dusty land
And when she shines she really shows you all she can
Oh Rio, Rio dance across the Rio Grande

[Verse 2]
I've seen you on the beach and I've seen you on TV
Two of a billion stars it means so much to me
Like a birthday or a pretty view
But then I'm sure that you know it's just for you

[Chorus]
Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand
Just like that river twisting through a dusty land
And when she shines she really shows you all she can
Oh Rio, Rio dance across the Rio Grande

[Bridge]
Hey now woo look at that did she nearly run you down
At the end of the drive the lawmen arrive
You make me feel alive, alive alive
I'll take my chance cause luck is on my side or something
I know what you're thinking
I tell you something I know what you're thinking

[Chorus]
Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand
Just like that river twists across a dusty land
And when she shines she really shows you all she can
Oh Rio, Rio dance across the Rio Grande
Her name is Rio she don't need to understand
And I might find her if I'm looking like I can
Oh Rio, Rio hear them shout across the land
From mountains in the north down to the Rio Grande



[Verse 1]
Well, I heard some people talkin' just the other day
And they said you were gonna put me on a shelf
But let me tell you I got some news for you
And you'll soon find out it's true
And then you'll have to eat your lunch all by yourself

[Chorus]
Cause I'm already gone
And I'm feelin' strong
I will sing this vict'ry song
Woo hoo hoo, my my, woo hoo hoo

[Verse 2]
The letter that you wrote me made me stop and wonder why
But I guess you felt like you had to set things right
Just remember this, my girl, when you look up in the sky
You can see the stars and still not see the light (that's right)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well I know it wasn't you who held me down
Heaven knows it wasn't you who set me free
So often times it happens that we live our lives in chains
And we never even know we have the key

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Cause I'm already gone
Yes, I'm already gone
And I'm feelin' strong
I will sing this vict'ry song
Cause I'm already gone
Yes, I'm already gone
Already gone
All right, nighty-night
Already gone...



Desperado, why don't you come to your senses
You've been out ridin' fences
For so long now
Oh, you're a hard one
I know that you've got your reasons
These things that are pleasin' you
Can hurt you somehow

Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy
She'll beat you if she's able
You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
Now it seems to me, some fine things
Have been laid upon your table
But you only want the ones
That you can't get

Desperado
Oh, you ain't getting no younger
Your pain and your hunger
They're driving you home
And freedom, oh, freedom
Well that's just some people talking
Your prison is walking through this world all alone

Don't your feet get cold in the winter time?
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the night time from the day
And you're losing all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feeling goes
Away...

Desperado
Why don't you come to your senses?
Come down from your fences, open the gate
It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you
(let somebody love you)
You better let somebody love you
Before it's too late



{Intro}

Somebody's gonna hurt someone
Before the night is through
Somebody's gonna come undone
There's nothin' we can do
Everybody wants to touch somebody
If it takes all night
Everybody wants to take a little chance
Make it come out right

There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
Lord, I know

Some people like to stay out late
Some folks can't hold out that long
But nobody wants to go home now
There's too much goin' on

This night is gonna last forever
Last all, last all summer long
Some time before the sun comes up
The radio is gonna play that song

There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
Lord, I know

There's gonna be a heartache tonight
The moon's shinin' bright
So turn out the light and we'll get it right
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
Heartache, baby

{Instrumental Bridge}

Somebody's gonna hurt someone, (somebody)
Before the night is through
Somebody's gonna come undone
There's nothin' we can do
(Everybody) Everybody wants to touch somebody
If it takes all night
Everybody wants to take a little chance
To make it come out right

There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
Let's go

We can beat around the bushes;
We can get down to the bone
We can leave it in the parkin' lot
But either way, there's gonna be a
Heartache tonight, a heartache tonight, I know (Lord, I know)
There'll be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
Woohoo!!!

{Outro}
(Break my heart)



[Verse 1: Don Henley]
On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway, I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
"This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

[Hook]
"Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year
You can find it here"

[Verse 2]
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes Benz
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain, "Please bring me my wine"
He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since 1969"
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

[Hook]
"Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They living it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis"

[Verse 3]
Mirrors on the ceiling, the pink champagne on ice
And she said: "We are all just prisoners here of our own device"
And in the master's chambers, they gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives, but they just can't kill the beast
Last thing I remember, I was running for the door
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
"Relax," said the night man, "We are programmed to receive
You can checkout any time you like, but you can never leave!"

[Guitar Solo]



[Verse 1]
Look at us baby, up all night
Tearing our love apart
Aren't we the same two people who live
Through years in the dark? Aah!

[Chorus 1]
Every time I try to walk away
Something makes me turn around and stay
And I can't tell you why

[Verse 2]
When we get crazy
It just ain't right
(Try to keep you head, little girl)
Girl, I get lonely, too
You don't have to worry
Just hold on tight
(Don't get caught in your little world)
Cause I love you
Nothing's wrong as far as I can see
We make it harder than it has to be
And I can't tell you why

[Chorus 2]
No, baby, I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]



[Verse 1]
Somewhere out there on that horizon
Out beyond the neon lights
I know there must be something better
But there's nowhere else in sight
It's survival in the city
When you live from day to day
City streets don't have much pity
When you're down, that's where you'll stay

[Chorus]
In the city (oh, oh)
In the city (oh, ohhh)

[Verse 2]
I was born here in the city
With my back against the wall
Nothing grows and life ain't very pretty
No one's there to catch you when you fall
Somewhere out on that horizon
Far away from the neon sky
I know there must be something better
And I can't stay another night

[Chorus]
In the city (oh, oh)
In the city (oh, ohhh)

[Outro]
In the city
In the city
In the city (oh, ohhh)



[Intro]
Livin' in the fast lane
This is dedicated to you Ben Stiller
You are my favorite motherfucker
I told you, didn't I?

[Verse 1]
Drama makes the world go around, does anybody got a problem with that?
My business is my business, who's guilty?
Can I get a witness, first things first
The Chocolate Starfish is my man Fred Durst
Access Hollywood lisence to kill
A redneck fucker from Jacksonville
Bangin' on the dumpster funk
My microphone machete's in the back of my trunk
Rocker's who's steady with the he says, she says
And don't forget about the starfish navigation system
Don't hate me, I'm just an alien
With thirty seven tons of new millenium
Dum diddie dum, where's it coming from?
Mrs. Aguilera, come and get some
Oh no, which way to go to the dance floor
It's on my stereo, pay me no mind
I seen The Fight Club about twenty eight times
And I'm 'a keep my pants saggin', keep a skateboard
A spray can, for the taggin'
And I'm 'a keep a lot of girls in my band wagon
Cause I don't give a fuck, livin' life in the fast lane

[Hook]
I'm just a crazy motherfucker
Livin' it up, not giving a fuck
Livin' life in the fast lane
Another crazy motherfucker
Livin' it up, not giving a fuck
In the fast lane

[Verse 2]
Take two, hoo haa
Now who's the star sucker? I'm the Starfish
You silly motherfucker
Puff puff, give the marijuana cig, opps
I don't even smoke, but I love the way it smells
Here's a toast to the females
Sippin' lung champagne from a seashell
I think I gotta feel and pop his ass like a zit
With the starfish navigation system
I'm no cheap thrills baby
Fill the briefcase with three dollar bills
I'm just an ordinary run of the mill fella
Spittin' out hella' mic skills
And I'm 'a keep my pants saggin', keep a skateboard
A spray can, for the taggin'
And I'm 'a keep a lot of girls in my band wagon
Cause I don't give a fuck, livin' life in the fast lane

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Cause it's so easy to tell a lie
And it's so easy to run and hide
But it's not easy to be alive
So don't be wasting none on my time

[Verse 3]
This world is like a cage and I don't think it's fair
And I don't even think that anybody cares
It'll leave a hole down the side of me
And it'll leave a scar, can anybody see?
That we gotta get it out, we gotta get it out
And I'mma get it out with the motherfuckin' microphone
Plugging in my soul
I'm a renegade riot getting out of control
I'mma keep it alive
And continue to be flying like an eagle to my destiny
So can you feel me? (Hell yeah)
Can you feel me? (Hell yeah)
If you feel motherfucker then you'll say (Hell yeah)
Hell yeah, I'm livin' life in the fast lane

[Bridge + Hook]



[Verse 1]
City girls just seem to find out early
How to open doors with just a smile
A rich old man
And she won't have to worry
She'll dress up all in lace and go in style
Late at night a big old house gets lonely
I guess every form of refuge has its price
And it breaks her heart to think her love is
Only given to a man with hands as cold as ice
So she tells him she must go out for the evening
To comfort an old friend who's feeling down
But he knows where she's going as she's leaving
She is headed for the cheating side of town

[Chorus]
You can't hide your lying eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lying eyes

[Verse 2]
On the other side of town a boy is waiting
With fiery eyes and dreams no one could steal
She drives on through the night anticipating
Because he makes her feel the way she used to feel
She rushes to his arms
They fall together
She whispers that it's only for awhile
She swears that soon she'll be coming back forever
She pulls away and leaves him with a smile

[Chorus]
You can't hide your lying eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lying eyes

[Verse 3]
She gets up and pours herself a strong one
And stares out at the stars up in the sky
Another night, it's gonna be a long one
She draws the shade and hangs her head to cry
She wonders how it ever got this crazy
She thinks about a boy she knew in school
Did she get tired or did she just get lazy?
She's so far gone she feels just like a fool
My, oh my, you sure know how to arrange things
You set it up so well, so carefully
Ain't it funny how your new life didn't change things
You're still the same old girl you used to be

[Chorus]
You can't hide your lying eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lying eyes
There ain't no way to hide your lying eyes
Honey, you can't hide your lying eyes



There's talk on the street; it sounds so familiar
Great expectations, everybody's watching you
People you meet, they all seem to know you
Even your old friends treat you like you're something new

Johnny come lately, the new kid in town
Everybody loves you, so don't let them down

You look in her eyes; the music begins to play
Hopeless romantics, here we go again
But after a while you're lookin' the other way
It's those restless hearts that never mend

Johnny come lately, the new kid in town
Will she still love you when you're not around?

There's so many things you should have told her
But night after night you're willing to hold her
Just hold her, tears on your shoulder

There's talk on the street, it's there to remind you
That it doesn't really matter which side you're on
You're walking away and they're talking behind you
They will never forget you 'til somebody new comes along

Where you been lately? There's a new kid in town
Everybody loves him, don't they?
Now he's holding her, and you're still around
Oh, my, my

There's a new kid in town
Just another new kid in town
Ooh, hoo
Everybody's talking 'bout the new kid in town
Ooh, hoo
Everybody's walking' like the new kid in town
There's a new kid in town
Theres a new kid in town people started walking
There's a new kid in town
I don't want to hear it
There's a new kid in town
I don't want to hear it
There's a new kid in town
There's a new kid in town
There's a new kid in town



[Verse 1]
One of these nights
One of these crazy old nights
We're gonna find out
Pretty mama
What turns on your lights
The full moon is calling
The fever is high
And the wicked wind whispers
And moans
You got your demons
You got desires
Well, i got a few of my own

[Chorus]
Oo, someone to be kind to in
Between the dark and the light
Oo, coming right behind you
Swear i'm gonna find you
One of these nights

[Verse 2]
One of these dreams
One of these lost and lonely dreams
We're gonna find one
One that really screams
I've been searching for the daughter
Of the devil himself
I've been searching for an angel in white
I've been waiting for a woman who's a little
Of both
And i can feel her but she's nowhere
In sight

[Chorus]
Oo, loneliness will blind you
In between the wrong and the right
Oo, coming right behind you
Swear i'm gonna find you
One of these nights

[Outro]
One of these nights
In between the dark and the light
Coming right behind you
Swear i'm gonna find you
Get you baby one of these nights
One of these nights
One of these nights
I can feel it
I can feel it
One of these nights
Coming right behind you
Swear i'm gonna find you now
One of these nights
One of these nights
One of these nights crazy crazy nights
One of these nights
Swear i'm gonna find you now
One of these nights
One of these nights



{Intro}

I like the way sparkling earrings lay
Upon your skin so brown
And I want to sleep with you in the desert night
With a million stars all around

I got a peaceful easy feelin'
And I know you won't let me down
Cause I'm already standin'
On the ground

And I found out a long time ago
What a woman can do to your soul
Aw but she can't take you any way
You don't already know how to go

I get a peaceful easy feelin'
And I know you won't let me down
Cause I'm already standin'
On the ground

{Instrumental}

I get this feelin' I may know you
As a lover and a friend
This voice keeps whisperin' in my other ear
Tells me I may never see you again

I get a peaceful easy feelin'
And I know you won't let me down
Cause I'm already standin'
Yes I'm already standin'
Yes I'm already standin'
On the ground

{Outro}



[Verse 1]
There are stars
In the Southern sky
Southward as you go
There is moonlight
And moss in the trees

[Chorus]
Down the Seven Bridges Road

[Verse 2]
Now I have loved you like a baby
Like some lonesome child
And I have loved you in a tame way
And I have loved you wild
Sometimes there's a part of me
Has to turn from here and go
Running like a child from these warm stars

[Chorus]
Down the Seven Bridges Road

[Bridge]
There are stars in the Southern sky
And if ever you decide
You should go
There is a taste of thyme sweetened honey

[Chorus]
Down the Seven Bridges Road



Well I'm a-running down the road trying to loosen my load
I've got seven women on my mind
Four that want to own me, two that want to stone me
One says she's a friend of mine

Take it easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy
Lighten up while you still can
Don't even try to understand
Just find a place to make your stand and take it easy

Well I'm a-standin' on the corner in Winslow, Arizona
With such a fine sight to see
It's a girl, my Lord, in a flatbed Ford
Slowin' down to take a look at me

Come on baby, don't say maybe
I've got to know if your sweet love is gonna save me
We may lose and we may win
But we will never be here again
Open up I'm climbin' in to take it easy

Well I'm a-running down the road trying to loosen my load
Got a world of trouble on my mind
I'm lookin' for a lover who won't blow my cover
She's just a little hard to find
Take it easy
Take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy
Come on baby, don't say maybe
I've got to know if your sweet love is gonna save me



[Verse 1]
All alone at the end of the of the evening
When the bright lights have faded to blue
I was thinking 'bout a woman who might have
Loved me and I never knew
You know I've always been a dreamer
(Spent my life running 'round)
And it's so hard to change
(Can't seem to settle down)
But the dreams I've seen lately
Keep on turning out and burning out
And turning out the same

[Chorus]
So put me on a highway
And show me a sign
And take it to the limit one more time

[Verse 2]
You can spend all your time making money
You can spend all your love making time
If it all fell to pieces tomorrow
Would you still be mine?
And when you're looking for your freedom
(Nobody seems to care)
And you can't find the door
(Can't find it anywhere)
When there's nothing to believe in
Still you're coming back, you're running back
You're coming back for more

[Chorus]
So put me on a highway
And show me a sign
And take it to the limit one more time

[Outro]
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Come on and take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
You gotta take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Come on and take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Come on and take it to the limit
You got to take it to the limit one more time



{​Instrumental lead}​

It's another tequila sunrise
Starin' slowly 'cross the sky said goodbye
He was just a hired hand
Workin' on the dreams he planned to try
The days go by

Every night when the sun goes down
Just another lonely boy in town
And she's out runnin' 'round

She wasn't just another woman
And I couldn't keep from comin' on
It's been so long
Oh and it's a hollow feelin' when
It comes down to dealin' friends
It never ends

{​Instrumental}​

Take another shot of courage
Wonder why the right words never come
You just get numb
It's another tequila sunrise, this old world
Still looks the same
Another frame, mmm



Every night I'm lyin' there
Holding you close in my dreams
Thinkin' about all the things that we said
Comin' apart at the seams

We try to talk it over
But the words come out too rough

I know you would try
To give me the best of your love

Beautiful faces and loud empty places
Look at the way that we live
Wasting our time on cheap talk and wine
Left us so little to give

That same old crowd was like a cold dark cloud
That we could never rise above
No, but

Here in my heart, I give you the best of my love
Oh, sweet darlin', you get the best of my love
Oh, sweet darlin', you get the best of my love

I'm goin' back in time, and it's a sweet dream
It was a quiet night, and I would be alright
If I could go to sleep there

But every morning, I wake up and worry
What's gonna happen today
You see it your way, and I see it mine
But we both see it slippin' away

You know we always have each other, baby
I guess it wasn't enough, no no no, but

Here in my heart, I give you the best of my love
Oh, sweet darlin', you get the best of my love
Oh, sweet darlin', you get the best of my love
Oh, sweet darlin', you get the best of my love, best of my love
Oh, sweet darlin', you get the best of my love, you get the best of my love

Cover of The Eagles' "Best of my Love"



[Verse 1]
I used to hurry a lot, I used to worry a lot
I used to stay out till the break of day
Oh, that didn't get it
It was high time I quit it
I just couldn't carry on that way

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, I did some damage, I know it's true
Didn't know I was so lonely, till I found you

[Chorus 1]
You can go the distance
We'll find out in the long run (In the long run)
We can handle some resistance
If our love is a strong one (Is a strong one)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
People talking about us
They got nothin' else to do
When it all comes down we will
Still come through

[Chorus 2]
In the long run
Ooh, I want to tell you, it's a long run

[Verse 2]
You know I don't understand why you don't
Treat yourself better
Do the crazy things that you do
Cause all the debutantes in Houston, baby
Couldn't hold a candle to you

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Did you do it for love?
Did you do it for money?
Did you do it for spite?
Did you think you had to, honey?

[Chorus 3]
Who is gonna make it?
We'll find out in the long run (In the long run)
I know we can take it
If our love is a strong one (Is a strong one)

[Pre-Chorus 4]
Well, we're scared, but we ain't shaking
Kinda bent, but we ain't breaking

[Chorus 4]
In the long run
Ooh, I want to tell you, it's a long run
In the long run
In the long run

[Outro]
Gonna find out, ooh fa-fa-fa-find out
Long-long-long-long, long-long-long-long
Ooh, run-run-run, baby, run-run, baby
Long, long, long, long



[Verse 1]
Tell us what you're gonna do tonight to mama
There must be someplace you can go
In the middle of the tall drinks and the drama
There must be someone you know
God knows you're looking good enough
But you're so smooth and the world's so rough
You might have something to lose
Oh no, pretty mama
What you gonna do in those shoes?

[Verse 2]
Got those pretty little straps around your ankles
Got those shiny little chains around your heart
You go to have your independence
But you don't know just where to start
Desperation in the singles bars
An' all those jerkoffs in their fancy cars
You can't believe your reviews
Oh no, you can't do that
Once you started wearing those shoes

{Guitar Solo}

[Bridge]
They're looking at you, leaning on you
Tell you anything you wanna hear
They give you tablets of love
They're waiting for you
Got to score you
Handy with a shovel and so sincere
Ooh, they got the kid glove

You just want someone to talk to
They just wanna get their hands on you
You get whatever you choose
Oh, no, you can't do that
Once you started wearing those shoes

Oh, no, you can't do that
Once you started wearing those shoes

(Shoes)



What kind of love have you got?
You should be home but you're not
A room full of noise and dangerous boys
Still make you thirsty and hot

I heard about you and that man
There's just one thing I don't understand
You say he's a liar and he put out your fire
How come you still got his gun in your hand?

Victim of love, I see a broken heart
You got your stories to tell
Victim of love, it's such an easy part
And you know how to play it so well

Some people never come clean
I think you know what I mean
You're walkin' the wire, pain and desire
Looking for love in between

Tell me your secrets, I'll tell you mine
This ain't no time to be cool
And tell all your girlfriends
Your "been around the world" friends
That talk is for losers and fools

Victim of love, I see a broken heart
I could be wrong, but I'm not, no I'm not
Victim of love, we're not so far apart
Show me, what kind of love have you got?

Victim of love, I see a broken heart
I could be wrong, but I'm not
Victim of love, we're not so far apart
What kind of love have you got?

Victim of love, you're just a victim of love
I could be wrong, but I'm not, no I'm not
Victim of love, now you're a victim of love
What kind of love have you got?
What kind of love have you got?
What kind of love have you got?



[Verse 1: Don Henley]
Raven hair & ruby lips
Sparks fly from her fingertips
Echoed voices in the night
She's a restless spirit on an endless flight

[Chorus]
Woo hoo, witchy woman
See how high she flies
Woo hoo, witchy woman
She got the moon in her eye

[Verse 2: Don Henley]
She held me spellbound in the night
Dancing shadows & firelight
Crazy laughter in another room
And she drove herself to madness with a silver spoon

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Ah, oh ah ah (waahaa)
(repeat x 2)

[Verse 3: Don Henley]
Well I know you want a lover
Let me tell you brother
She's been sleeping in the devil's bed
And there's some rumours going round, someone's underground
She can rock you in the night-time 'til your skin turns red

[Chorus]



{Intro}

Mama never understood what it's like for a losing man
When her number one son goes bad playing cards with the Devil's Hand
Daddy got real sick so quick - four walls never understand
I was the one who got good with the gun - took the money from the rich man's land

Give me some water 'cause I shot a man on the Mexican border
Cool, cool water
Give me some water
I need a little water

Jimmy grew up so fast and he met me at the pass one day
Said, "You're a wanted man. Take your brother's hand - I'll be running with you, anyway."
So we rode late in the night like fires on the desert sand
'til one day the posse caught us 'cause the sheriff always gets his man

Give me some water 'cause I killed a man on the Mexican border
Cool, cool water
I need a little water

Oh, geeze, if I just get loose my hands
I'd run just as fast as my legs can
But, Lord, I've got no room to run
Shouldn't have done what I did without that gun

Give me some water 'cause I killed a man on the Mexican border
Cool, cool water

Can't you see that long, white rope hanging from the hangman's tree
Take the restless horse; tie may hands, of course; tell my mother that I'm finally free
Let me die like a man - no one understands; let me pray that a poor man pray
Smack that horse in the ass; with my last dying gasp my brother could hear me say

Give me some water 'cause I shot a man on the Mexican border
Cool, cool water
Give me some water

Give me some water 'cause I shot a man on the Mexican border
Cool, cool water
Give me some water

Give me some water 'cause I shot a man on the Mexican border
Cool, cool water
Give me some water

Give me some water 'cause I killed a man on the Mexican border
Cool, sweet water
Give me some water



Rosanna's daddy had a car she loved to drive
Stole the keys one night and took me for a ride
Turned up the music just as loud as it could go
Blew out the speakers in her daddy's radio

She was shakin' (oh oh ooo oh)
Snappin' her fingers (oh oh ooo oh)
She was movin' round and round (oh oh ooo oh)
That girl was shakin' (oh oh ooo oh)

We started drinkin' wasn't thinkin' too straight
She was doin' 80 and she slammed on the brakes
Got so high we had to pull to the side
We did some shakin' 'til the middle of the night

Shakin' (oh oh ooo oh)
Snappin' her fingers (oh oh ooo oh)
She was up and down and round and round
Shakin' (oh oh ooo oh)
Shakin' (oh oh ooo oh) (oh oh ooo oh)
(oh oh ooo oh) (oh oh ooo oh)

I got a little nervous
When she took her coat off
She looked so pretty
Ahh yeah

I'm always talkin' baby talkin' too much
I love that little girl and I just can't get enough
It takes a lonely night with nowhere to go
Just call Rosanna, it's a hell of a show

And she's shakin' (oh oh ooo oh)
Snappin' her fingers (oh oh ooo oh)
She'll be movin' round and round (oh oh ooo oh)
Oh she's shakin' (oh oh ooo oh)

Shakin' (oh oh ooo oh)
Snappin' her fingers (oh oh ooo oh)
She'll be movin' up and down (oh oh oo oh)
Round and round and round (oh oh ooo oh)
And shakin' (oh oh ooo oh)

Sha sha sha sha sha she was shakin'
Sha sha sha sha sha she was shakin'
Sha sha sha sha sha she was shakin'
Sha sha sha sha sha she was shakin'



Ohhh.. Yeah..

[Verse 1]
I feel a hunger, it's a hunger
That tries to keep a man awake at night
Are you the answer? I shouldn't wonder
When I can feel you whet my appetite
With all the power you're releasing
It isn't safe to walk the city streets alone
Anticipation is running through me
Let's find the keys and turn this engine on

[Bridge]
I can feel you breathe
I can feel your heart beat faster (Faster)

[Chorus]
Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go 'til you see the light
Take me home tonight
Listen, honey, just like Ronnie sang
Be my little baby, oh, ho, oh

[Verse 2]
I get frightened in all this darkness
I get nightmares I hate to sleep alone
I need some company a guardian angel
To keep me warm when the cold winds blow

[Bridge]
I can feel you breathe
I can feel your heart beat faster (Faster)

[Chorus]
Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go 'til you see the light
Take me home tonight
Listen, honey , just like Ronnie sang
Be my little baby
Be my little baby, uh-huh

Just like Ronnie sang
I said
Just like Ronnie sang
Be my little baby
Baby, my darlin', uh, uh, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
I feel a hunger
It's a hunger

[Chorus]
Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go 'til you see the light
Take me home tonight
Listen, honey, just like Ronnie sang
Be my little baby, oh, ho, oh

[Chorus]
Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go 'til you see the light
Take me home tonight
Listen, honey, just like Ronnie sang
Be my little baby, oh, ho, oh

[Chorus]
Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go 'til you see the light
Take me home tonight
Listen, honey, just like Ronnie sang
Be my little baby, oh, ho, oh



Ooh
Something's got a hold on me now
It's a feelin', burnin' like a love on fire
Hold me tight baby
Don't leave me by myself tonight
'Cause I don't think I can make it through the night

I think I'm in love
And my life's looking up
I think I'm in love
'Cause I can't get enough (no, no, no)
I think I'm in love
It's gotta be love

It surrounds me
Moving like a sea of madness
It controls me
Makes me do all the things I do for you
Blow my mind, babe
Thinkin' about you now
And I don't know if I'll make it through the night

I think I'm in love
And my life's looking up
I think I'm in love
'Cause I can't get enough (no, no, no)
I think I'm in love
It's gotta be love

Baby, how you do it
There must be something to it
Babe now it's gotta be love
The magic's in your hand
You made me understand
I know, I know it's gotta be love

It's gotta be love
(Love) and my life's looking up (love)



Got a surprise especially for you
Something that both of us have always wanted to do
We've waited so long, waited so long
We've waited so long, waited so long

I'm gonna take you on a trip so far from here
I've got two tickets in my pocket, now baby, we're gonna disappear
We've waited so long, waited so long
We've waited so long, waited so long

I've got two tickets to paradise
Won't you pack your bags, we'll leave tonight
I've got two tickets to paradise
I've got two tickets to paradise

I'm gonna take you on a trip so far from here
I've got two tickets in my pocket, now baby, we're gonna disappear
We've waited so long, waited so long
We've waited so long, waited so long

I've got two tickets to paradise
Won't you pack your bags, we'll leave tonight
I've got two tickets to paradise
Won't you pack your bags, we'll leave tonight
I've got two tickets to paradise
Won't you pack your bags, we'll leave tonight
I've got two tickets to paradise
I've got two tickets to paradise



[Instrumental]



The mountain is high, the valley is low
And you're confused on which way to go
So I've come here to give you a hand
And lead you into the promised land, so

Come on and take a free ride (Free ride)
Come on and sit here by my side
Come on and take a free ride

All over the country, I'm seeing it the same
Nobody's winning at this kind of game
We gotta do better, it's time to begin
You know all the answers must come from within, so

Come on and take a free ride (Free ride)
Come on and sit here by my side
Come on and take a free ride

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Intro]
(War, what is it good for?) Absolutely nothing
(War, what is it good for?) Absolutely nothing
(War, what is it good for?) Absolutely nothing

[Verse 1]
War is something that I despise
Because it means destruction of innocent lives
War means tears in thousands of mothers' eyes
When their sons go out to fight and lose their lives
I said

[Hook]
(War) good God y'all
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing, say it again
(War, what is it good for?) Absolutely nothing

[Verse 2]
(War), It ain't nothing but a heartbreaker
(War), Friend only to the undertaker
War is the enemy of all mankind
The thought of war blows my mind
War has caused unrest, within the younger generation
Induction then destruction. Who wants to die?

[Hook]
(War) good God y'all
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing, say it, say it, say it
(War, what is it good for?) Absolutely nothing

[Verse 3]
(War), It ain't nothing but a heartbreaker
(War), Its only friend is the undertaker
War has shattered many young men's dreams
Made them disabled, bitter and mean
Life is much too short and precious to be fighting wars these days
War can't give life it can only take it away

[Hook]
(War) good God y'all
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing, say it
(War, what is it good for?) Absolutely nothing

[Verse 4]
Listen to me
(War), It ain't nothing but a heartbreaker
(War), Friend only to the undertaker
Peace, love and understanding
Tell me, is there no place for them today?
They say we must fight to keep our freedom
But Lord knows there's gotta be a better way

[Hook]
(War) good God y'all
(What is it good for?) You tell me, say it, say it, say it, say it
(War) good God y'all
(What is it good for?) Stand up and shout it (Nothing)



[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Midnight on the water
I saw the ocean's daughter
Walking on a wave chicane
Staring as she called my name

[Chorus]
And I can't get it out of my head
No, I can't get it out of my head
Now my old world is gone for dead
Cos I can't get it out of my head

[Verse 2]
Breakdown on the shoreline
Can't move, it's an ebb tide
Morning don't get here till night
Searching for her silver light

[Chorus]
And I can't get it out of my head
No, I can't get it out of my head
Now my old world is gone for dead
Cos I can't get it out of my head, no no

[instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Bank job in the city
Robin hood and William Tell and Ivanhoe and Lancelot, they don't envy me
Sitting till the sun goes down
In dreams the world keep going round and round

[Chorus x2]
And I can't get it out of my head
No, I can't get it out of my head
Now my old world is gone for dead
Cos I can't get it out of my head, no no

No, I can't get it out of my head
No, I can't get it out of my head
Now my old world is gone for dead
Cos I can't get it out of my head, no no no no



{Intro}

In this life I've seen everything I can see, woman
I've seen lovers flying through the air
Hand in hand
I've seen babies dancing
In the midnight sun
And I've seen kings and queens from the heavenly skies above
I've seen old men crying at their own grave sides
And I've seen pigs all sitting watching
Picture slides
But I never seen nothin' like you

Do ya do ya want my love, woman
Do ya do ya want my face, I need it
Do ya do ya want my mind, I'm sayin'
Do ya do ya want my love

Well I heard the crowd singin' out of tune
As they sat and sang auld lang syne
By the light of the moon
I heard the preacher bangin' on the drums
And I heard the police playin' with their guns
But I never heard nothing like you

{Bridge}

In the country where the sky touches down
On the field she lay her down to rest
In the morning sun
They come a runnin' just to get a look just to
Feel to touch her long black hair they don't
Give a damn

{Bridge}

But I never seen nothin' like you

Do ya do ya want my love, woman
Do ya do ya want my face, I need it
Do ya do ya want my mind, I'm sayin'
Do ya do ya want my love

Well I think you know what I'm trying to say
Woman
That is I'd like to save you for a rainy day
I've seen enough of the world to know
That I've got to get it all to get it all to grow

Do ya do ya want my love, come on now
Do ya do ya want my face, I need it
Do ya do ya want my mind, alright now
Do ya do ya want my love

{Outro}

Oh, look out

Do ya do ya want my love
Do ya do ya want my love, oh-oh



[Intro]
You made a fool of me, but them broken dreams have got to end

[Verse 1]
Hey woman, you got the blues
Cos' you ain't got no one else to use
There's an open road that leads nowhere
So just make some miles
Between here and there
There's a hole in my head where the rain comes in,
You took my body and played to win
Ha Ha woman it's a crying shame
But you ain't got nobody else to blame

[Hook]
Evil woman, evil woman, evil woman, evil woman

[Verse 2]
Rolled in from another town
Hit some gold too hot to settle down
But a fool and his money soon go separate ways
And you found a fool lyin' in a daze
Ha Ha woman what you gonna do
You destroyed all the virtues that the Lord gave you
It's so good that you're feeling pain
But you better get yourself on board the very next train

[Hook]
Evil woman, evil woman, evil woman ( you're an evil woman)
Evil woman
Hey he-he-hey
Hey he-he-hey
Hey hehhey
Evil woman, evil woman, evil woman ( you're an evil woman)
Evil woman

[Verse 3]
Evil woman how you done me wrong
But now you're tryin' to wail a different song
Ha Ha funny how you broke me up
You made the wine now you drink the cup
I came runnin' every time you cried
Thought I saw love smilin' in your eyes
Ha Ha very nice to know, that you ain't got no place left to go

[Outro]
Evil woman, evil woman, evil woman (you're an evil woman)
Evil woman
Evil woman
Evil woman (you're an evil woman)
Evil woman (such an evil woman)
Evil woman (you're an evil woman)
Evil woman (such an evil woman)
Evil woman (you're an evil woman)



Reversed:
The music is reversible
But time is not
Turn back
Turn back
Turn back
Turn back



Sailin' away on the crest of a wave
It's like magic
Rollin' and ridin' and slippin' & slidin'
It's magic

And you, and your sweet desire
You took me, higher and higher, baby
It's a livin' thing
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a given thing
What a terrible thing to lose

(I'm taking a dive, dive)

Making believe this is what you conceived
From your worst day
Moving in line then you look back in time
To the first day

And you, and your sweet desire
You took me, higher and higher, baby
It's a livin' thing
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a given thing
What a terrible thing to lose

Takin' a dive 'cos you can't halt the slide
Floating downstream
So let her go don't start spoiling the show
It's a bad dream

And you, and your sweet desire
You took me, higher and higher, baby
It's a livin' thing
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a given thing
What a terrible thing to lose



[Verse 1: George Harrison]
Well, gonna write a little letter
Gonna mail it to my local DJ
It's a rocking little record
I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven
Gotta hear it again today

[Verse 2: George Harrison]
You know my temperature's rising
And the jukebox blows a fuse
My heart's beating rhythm
And my soul keeps singing the blues
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

[Verse 3: George Harrison]
I got a rocking pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues (Woo)
I think I caught the arthritis
Sitting down by the rhythm revue
Roll over Beethoven
Rocking in two by two

[Verse 4: George Harrison]
Well if you feel it and like it
Well get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up
Just a trifle further and reel and rock it
Roll it over
Roll over Beethoven
Rocking in two by two (Woo)

[Verse 5: George Harrison]
Well early in the morning
I'm a-giving you the warning
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle
I'll play my fiddle
Ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

[Verse 6: George Harrison]
You know she wiggles like a glow worm
Dance like a spinning top
She's got a crazy partner
Oughta see 'em reel and rock
Long as she got a dime
The music will never stop

[Outro: George Harrison]
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Dig to these rhythm and blues



{Intro}

You're sailing softly through the sun
In a broken stone age dawn
You fly so high

I get a strange magic
Oh, what a strange magic
Oh, it's a strange magic
Got a strange magic
Got a strange magic

{Bridge}

You're walking meadows in my mind
Making waves across my time
Oh no, oh no

I get a strange magic
Oh, what a strange magic
Oh, it's a strange magic
Got a strange magic
Got a strange magic

{Bridge}

Oh, I'm never gonna be the same again
Now I've seen the way it's got to end
Sweet dream, sweet dream

Strange magic
Oh, what a strange magic
Oh, it's a strange magic
Got a strange magic
Got a strange magic

It's magic, it's magic, it's magic
Strange magic
Oh, what a strange magic
Oh, it's a strange magic
Got a strange magic
Got a strange magic
You know I got a strange magic



[Introduction]
Where did you go?

[Verse 1]
I was searchin' (searchin') on a one-way street
I was hopin' (hopin') for a chance to meet
I was waitin' for the operator on the line

[Pre-Chorus]
(She's gone so long) What can I do?
(Where could she be?) No, no, no
Don't know what I'm gonna do
I gotta get back to you

[Chorus]
You gotta slow down (slow down)
Sweet talkin' woman (slow down)
You got me runnin' (run run) you got me searchin'
Hold on (hold on) sweet talkin' lover (hold on)
It's so sad if that's the way it's over

(Sweet talking woman)

[Verse 2]
I was (workin') many days go by
I was thinkin' (thinkin') 'bout the lonely nights
Communication breakdown all around

[Pre-Chorus]
(She's gone so long) What can I do?
(Where could she be?) No no no
Don't know what I'm gonna do
I gotta get back to you

[Chorus]
You gotta slow down (slow down)
Sweet talkin' woman (slow down)
You got me runnin' (run run) you got me searchin'
Hold on (hold on) sweet talkin' lover (hold on)
It's so sad if that's the way it's over

[Verse 3]
I've been livin' (livin') on a dead end street
I've been askin' (askin' kindly) everybody I meet
Insufficient data coming through

[Pre-Chorus]
(She's gone so long) What can I do?
(Where could she be?) No, no, no
Don't know what I'm gonna do

[Chorus]

It's so sad if that's the way it's over

[Repeat & fade out]



Hello! How are you?
Have you been alright, through all those lonely nights?
That's what I'd say, I'd tell you everything
If you'd pick up that telephone

Hey! How you feeling?
Are you still the same?
Don't you realize the things we did, we did
Were all for real, not a dream?
I just can't believe
They've all faded out of view

[Pre-Chorus]
Doo-wop, do-be-do-do-wop
Doo-wa-doo-day
Blue days, black nights
Doo-wa-doo-day
I look into the sky
(The love you need ain't gonna see you through)
And I wonder why
(The little things are finally coming true)

[Chorus]
Telephone line, give me some time, I'm living in twilight
Telephone line, give me some time, I'm living in twilight

Ok, so no-one's answering
Well can't you just let it ring a little longer?
I'll just sit tight, through shadows of the night
Let it ring for evermore

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]



Hey now, the wells run dry
Pages of your book on fire
Read the writing on the wall

Hoedown, it's a showdown
Everywhere you look, we're fighting
Hear the call

And you know it's gettin' stronger
I don't think they can last much longer
Turn to stone

Well, there's a change in the wind
You know the signs don't lie
Such a strange feelin' and I don't know why
It's takin' such a long time

And the backyard people and they work all day
The day gets wasted, it's safe to say
The day's spent makin' words rhyme

And you know it's getting stronger
I can't make'em rhyme that much longer
Turn to stone



[Verse 1]
Raised to be a lady by the golden rule
Alice was the spawn of a public school
With a double barrel name in the back of her brain
And a simple case of mummy-doesn't-love-me blues
Reality it seems was just a dream
She couldn't get it on with the boys on the scene

[Pre-Chorus]
But what do you expect from a chick who's just sixteen
And hey, hey, hey, you know what i mean

[Chorus]
All the young girls love alice
Tender young alice they say
Come over and see me
Come over and please me
Alice it's my turn today
All the young girls love alice
Tender young alice they say
If i give you my number
Will you promise to call me
Wait till my husband's away

[Verse 2]
Poor little darling with a chip out of her heart
It's like acting in a movie when you got the wrong part
Getting your kicks in another girl's bed
And it was only last tuesday they found you in the subway dead
And who could you call your friends down in soho
One or two middle-aged dykes in a go-go

[Pre-Chorus]
But what do you expect from a 16-year-old yo-yo?
And hey, hey, hey, oh don’t you know.”

[Chorus]



[Verse 1]
Hey kids, shake it loose together
The spotlight's hitting something
That's been known to change the weather
We'll kill the fatted calf tonight
So stick around
You're gonna hear electric music
Solid walls of sound

[Pre-Chorus]
Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet
But they're so spaced out
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh Bennie, she's really keen

[Chorus]
She's got electric boots
A mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets

[Verse 2]
Hey kids, plug into the faithless
Maybe they're blinded
But Bennie makes them ageless
We shall survive, let us take ourselves along
Where we fight our parents out in the streets
To find who's right and who's wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet
But they're so spaced out
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh Bennie, she's really keen

[Chorus]
She's got electric boots
A mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine

[Verse 1]
Goodbye Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

[Verse 2]
Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

[Verse 3]
Goodbye Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
Goodbye Norma Jeane
From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

[Outro]
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did



[Verse 1]
Captain Fantastic raised and regimented, hardly a hero
Just someone his mother might know
Very clearly a case for corn flakes and classics
"Two teas both with sugar please"
In the back of an alley
While little Dirt Cowboys turned brown in their saddles
Sweet chocolate biscuits and red rosy apples in summer
For it's hay make and "Hey mom
Do the papers say anything good?
Are there chances in life for little Dirt Cowboys?
Should I make my way out of my home in the woods?"

[Chorus 1]
Brown Dirt Cowboy, still green and growing
City slick Captain
Fantastic the feedback
The honey the hive could be holding
For there's weak winged young sparrows that starve in the winter
Broken young children on the wheels of the winners
And the sixty-eight summer festival wallflowers are thinning

[Chorus 2]
For cheap easy meals are hardly a home on the range
Too hot for the band with a desperate desire for change
We've thrown in the towel too many times
Out for the count and when we're down
Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy
From the end of the world to your town

[Verse 2]
And all this talk of Jesus coming back to see us
Hmmm, couldn't fool us
For we were spinning out our lines walking on the wire
Hand in hand went music and the rhyme
The Captain and the Kid stepping in the ring
From here on sonny sonny sonny, it's a long and lonely climb

[Chorus 2][2x]

[Outro]
We've thrown in the towel too many times
Out for the count and when we're down
Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy
From the end of the world to your town



[Chorus 1]
I remember when rock was young
Me and Suzie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

[Chorus 2]
Well Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will
Oh lawdy mama those Friday nights
When Suzie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

[Verse 1]
But the years went by and the rock just died
Suzie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
But they'll never kill the thrills we've got
Burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last

[Chorus 2]
Well Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will
Oh lawdy mama those Friday nights
When Suzie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

[Chorus 1]
I remember when rock was young
Me and Suzie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

[Chorus 2]
Well Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will
Oh lawdy mama those Friday nights
When Suzie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight



[Chorus]
Daniel is traveling tonight on a plane
I can see the red tail lights heading for Spain
And I can see Daniel waving goodbye
Oh it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes

[Verse 1]
They say Spain is pretty though I've never been
And Daniel says it's the best place that he's ever seen
He should know, he's been there enough
Oh I miss Daniel, oh I miss him so much, oh

[Chorus ]
Daniel my brother, you are older than me
Do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal?
Your eyes have died but you see more than I
Daniel you're a star in the face of the sky
Daniel my brother, you are older than me
Do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal?
Your eyes have died but you see more than I
Daniel you're a star in the face of the sky

[Outro]
Daniel is leaving tonight on a plane
I can see the red tail lights heading for Spain
And I can see Daniel waving goodbye
Oh it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes



[Verse 1]
I can't light no more of your darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growing tired and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life
Too late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meaning when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light

[Chorus]
Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me

[Verse 2]
I can't find the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way I feel
Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm
But these cuts I have they need love to help them heal

[Chorus]
Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me
Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me



[Funeral for a Friend: long instrumental]

[Love Lies Bleeding:]

[Verse 1]
The roses in the window box
Have tilted to one side
Everything about this house
Was born to grow and die

Oh, it doesn't seem a year ago
To this very day
You said I'm sorry honey
If I don't change the pace
I can't face another day

[Chorus 1]
And love lies bleeding in my hand
Oh, it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playing rock and roll and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you
So I split the band
Love lies bleeding in my hands

[Short guitar interlude]

[Verse 2]
I wonder if those changes
Have left a scar on you
Like all the burning hoops of fire
That you and I passed through

You're a bluebird on a telegraph line
I hope you're happy now
Well, if the wind of change
Comes down your way girl
You'll make it back somehow

[Chorus 2]
And love lies bleeding in my hand
Oh, it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playing rock and roll and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you
So I split the band
Love lies bleeding in my hands

[Short guitar interlude]

[Piano solo break with band slowly building back up]

[Guitar solo: Davey Johnstone]

[Chorus 3]
And love lies bleeding in my hand
Oh, it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playing rock and roll and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you
So I split the band
Love lies bleeding in my hands

[Short guitar interlude]

[Ad-libs]
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Love lies bleeding in my hands

Ooh-hoo! Ooh-hoo!
Ooh-hoo!

Ooh-hoo! Ooh-hoo!
Ooh-hoo!

[Intense band outro on fade-out]



[Verse 1]
When are you going to come down?
When are you going to land?
I should have stayed on the farm
I should have listened to my old man

You know you can't hold me forever
I didn't sign up with you
I'm not a present for your friends to open
This boy's too young to be singing the blues

[Chorus]
So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough
Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny-back toad
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

[Verse 2]
What do you think you'll do then?
I bet that'll shoot down your plane
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again
Maybe you'll get a replacement
There's plenty like me to be found
Mongrels who ain't got a penny
Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground

[Chorus]
So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough
Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny-back toad
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road



[Verse 1]
Hello, baby hello
Haven't seen your face for a while
Have you quit doing time for me
Or are you still the same spoiled child
Hello, I said hello
Is this the only place you thought to go
Am I the only man you ever had
Or am I just the last surviving friend... that you know

[Chorus]
Harmony and me
We're pretty good company
Looking for an island
In our boat upon the sea
Harmony, gee I really love you
And I want to love you forever
And dream of the never, never, never leaving harmony

[Verse 2]
Hello, baby hello
Open up your heart and let your feelings flow
You're not unlucky knowing me
Keeping the speed real slow
In any case I set my own pace
By stealing the show, say hello... hello

[Chorus]
Harmony and me
We're pretty good company
Looking for an island
In our boat upon the sea
Harmony, gee I really love you
And I want to love you forever
And dream of the never, never, never leaving harmony

[Outro]
Never leaving harmony
Harmony [x8]



[Verse 1]
When I look back boy I must have been green
Bopping in the country, fishing in a stream
Looking for an answer trying to find a sign
Until I saw your city lights honey I was blind

[Chorus]
They said get back honky cat
Better get back to the woods
Well I quit those days and my redneck ways
And oh the change is gonna do me good
You better get back honky cat
Living in the city ain't where it's at
It's like trying to find gold in a silver mine
It's like trying to drink whisky from a bottle of wine

[Verse 2]
Well I read some books and I read some magazines
About those high class ladies down in new orleans
And all the folks back home well, said I was a fool
They said oh, believe in the lord is the golden rule

[Chorus]
They said get back honky cat
Better get back to the woods
Well I quit those days and my redneck ways
And oh the change is gonna do me good
They said get back honky cat
Better get back to the woods
Well I quit those days and my redneck ways
And oh the change is gonna do me good

[Verse 3]
They said stay at home boy, you gotta tend the farm
Living in the city boy, is going to break your heart
But how can you stay, when your heart says no
How can you stop when your feet say go

[Chorus]
You better get back honky cat
Better get back to the woods
Well I quit those days and my redneck ways
And oh the change is gonna do me good
You better get back honky cat
Living in the city ain't where it's at
It's like trying to find gold in a silver mine
It's like trying to drink whisky from a bottle of wine

[Outtro]
Get back honky cat
Get back honky cat, get back
Get back honky cat
Get back honky cat, get back
Get back honky cat, get back



[Verse 1]
Levon bears his war wound like a crown
He calls his child Jesus
Because he likes the name
And he sends him to the finest school in town

Levon, Levon likes his money
He makes a lot they say
Spends his days counting
In a garage by the motorway

[Bridge]
He was born a pauper to a pawn
On a Christmas day
When the New York Times said
God is dead and the War's begun
Alvin Tostig has a son today

[Chorus]
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan

And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon

[Verse 2]
Levon sells cartoon balloons in town
His family business thrives
Jesus blows up balloons all day
Sits on the porch swing watching them fly

And Jesus, he wants to go to Venus
Leave Levon far behind
Take a balloon and go sailing
While Levon, Levon slowly dies

[Bridge]
He was born a pauper to a pawn
On a Christmas day
When the New York Times said
God is dead and the War's begun
Alvin Tostig has a son today

[Chorus]
[Chorus]



[Verse 1]
I can see very well
There's a boat on the reef with a broken back
And I can see it very well
There's a joke and I know it very well
It's one of those that I told you long ago
Take my word I'm a madman don't you know

[Verse 2]
Once a fool had a good part in the play
If it's so would I still be here today?
It's quite peculiar in a funny sort of way
They think it's very funny everything I say
Get a load of him, he's so insane
You better get your coat dear
It looks like rain

[Chorus]
We'll come again next Thursday afternoon
The In-laws hope they'll see you very soon
But is it in your conscience that you're after
Another glimpse of the Madman across the Water

[Verse 1]
I can see very well
There's a boat on the reef with a broken back
And I can see it very well
There's a joke and I know it very well
It's one of those that I told you long ago
Take my word I'm a madman don't you know

[Verse 3]
The ground's a long way down but I need more
Is the nightmare black
Or are the windows painted?
Will they come again next week
Can my mind really take it?

[Chorus]
We'll come again next Thursday afternoon
The In-laws hope they'll see you very soon
But is it in your conscience that you're after
Another glimpse of the Madman across the Water



She packed my bags last night pre flight
Zero hour nine a.m
And I'm gonna be high, as a kite by then
I miss the earth so much, I miss my wife
It's lonely out in space
On such a timeless flight
And I think it's gonna be a long long time
Till touch down brings me round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no, I'm a rocket man
Rocket man burning out his fuse up here alone
And I think it's gonna be a long long time
Till touch down brings me round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no, I'm a rocket man
Rocket man burning out his fuse up here alone
Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
In fact it's cold as Hell
And there's no one there to raise them if you didn't
And all this science, I don't understand
It's just my job, five days a week
A rocket man, a rocket man
And I think it's gonna be a long long time
Till touch down brings me round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no, I'm a rocket man
Rocket man burning out his fuse up here alone
And I think it's gonna be a long long time
Till touch down brings me round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no, I'm a rocket man
Rocket man burning out his fuse up here alone
Now, I think it's gonna be a long long time
And I think it's gonna be a long long time
And I think it's gonna be a long long time
And I think it's gonna be a long long time
...



[Verse 1]
It's getting late, have you seen my mates?
Ma, tell me when the boys get here
It's seven o'clock and I want to rock
Want to get a belly full of beer
My old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys
And my old lady, she don't care
My sister looks cute in her braces and boots
A handful of grease in her hair

[Chorus]
Don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Going to set this dance alight
Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright

[Verse 2]
Well, they're packed pretty tight in here tonight
I'm looking for a dolly who'll see me right
I may use a little muscle to get what I need
I may sink a little drink and shout out "she's with me!"
A couple of the sounds that I really like
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike
I'm a juvenile product of the working class
Whose best friend floats at the bottom of a glass

[Chorus]
Don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Going to set this dance alight
Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright

[Guitar break]

[Chorus]
Don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Going to set this dance alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright

[Coda]
Saturday! Saturday! Saturday! Saturday! Saturday! Saturday!
Saturday! Saturday! Saturday night's alright
Saturday! Saturday! Saturday! Saturday! Saturday! Saturday!
Saturday! Saturday! Saturday night's alright
Saturday! Saturday! Saturday! Saturday! Saturday! Saturday!
Saturday! Saturday! Saturday night's alright



[Verse 1]
When I think of those East End lights, muggy nights
The curtains drawn in the little room downstairs
Prima Donna lord you really should have been there
Sitting like a princess perched in her electric chair
And it's one more beer and I don't hear you anymore
We've all gone crazy lately
My friends out there rolling round the basement floor

[Chorus 1]
And someone saved my life tonight sugar bear
(Sugar bear)
You almost had your hooks in me didn't you dear
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized
Sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly
And butterflies are free to fly
Fly away
High away
Bye bye
(Ooh)

[Piano riff]

[Verse 2]
I never realized the passing hours of evening showers
A slip noose hanging in my darkest dreams
I'm strangled by your haunted social scene
Just a pawn out-played by a dominating queen
It's four o'clock in the morning
Damn it! Listen to me good
I'm sleeping with myself tonight
Saved in time, thank God my music's still alive
(Oh!)

[Chorus 2]
And someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear
(Sugar bear, sugar bear, sugar bear)
You almost had your hooks in me
Didn't you, dear?
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized
Sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly
And butterflies are free to fly
Fly away
High away
Bye-bye
(Ooh)

[Piano riff]

[Bridge]
And I would have walked head on
Into the deep end of the river
Clinging to your stocks and bonds
Paying your H.P. demands forever
They're coming in the morning with a truck to take me home

Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
So save your strength and run the field you play alone

[Chorus 3]
And someone saved my life tonight sugar bear
(Sugar bear, sugar bear, sugar bear)
You almost had your hooks in me
Didn't you, dear?
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized
Sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly
And butterflies are free to fly
Fly away
High away
Bye-bye

[Outro with ad-libs]
Someone saved, someone saved
Someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved
Someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved
Someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved
Someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved
Someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved
Someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved
Someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)



[Verse 1]
If you feel that it's real I'm on trial
And I'm here in your prison
Like a coin in your mint
I am dented and I'm spent with high treason

[Chorus 1]
Through a glass eye your throne
Is the one danger zone
Take me to the pilot for control
Take me to the pilot of your soul

[Chorus 2][x2]
Take me to the pilot
Lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot
I am but a stranger

[Verse 2]
Well I know he's not old
And I'm told, and I'm told he's a virgin
Oh he may be she
But I'm told, and I'm never never for certain

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2][x2]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2][x2]

[Outro]
Take me, take me, oh, oh
Take me, take me, yeah, yeah
Take me, take me, baby, baby, baby
Take me, take me



[Verse 1]
I was sitting in the classroom
Trying to look intelligent
In case the teacher looked at me
She was long and she was lean
She's a middle-aged dream
And that lady means the whole world to me
It's a natural achievement
Conquering my homework
With her image pounding in my brain
She's an inspiration
For my graduation
And she helps to keep the classroom sane

[Chorus]
Oh teacher I need you like a little child
You got something in you to drive a schoolboy wild
You give me education in the lovesick blues
Help me get straight come out and say
Teacher I, teacher I, teacher I, Teacher I need you

[Verse 2]
I have to write a letter
Tell about my feelings
Just to let her know the scene
Focus my attention
On some further education
In connection with the birdies and the bees
So I'm sitting in the classroom
I'm looking like a zombie
I'm waiting for the bell to ring
I've got John Wayne stances
I've got Erroll Flynn advances
And it doesn't mean a doggoned thing

[Chorus][x2]



[Verse 1: Elton John]
I was justified when I was five
Raising Cain, I spit in your eye
Times are changing, now the poor get fat
But the fever's going to catch you when the bitch gets back
Eat meat on Friday that's alright
Even like steak on a Saturday night
I can bitch the best at your social do's
I get high in the evening sniffing pots of glue

[Chorus: Elton John]
I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch
Oh the bitch is back
Stone cold sober as a matter of fact
I can bitch, I can bitch
Because I'm better than you
It's the way that I move
The things that I do, oh

[Verse 2: Elton John]
I entertain by picking brains
Sell my soul by dropping names
I don't like those, my God, what's that
Oh it's full of nasty habits when the bitch gets back

[Chorus: Elton John]
I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch
Oh the bitch is back
Stone cold sober as a matter of fact

I can bitch, I can bitch
Because I'm better than you
It's the way that I move
The things that I do, oh

[Chorus: Elton John]
I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch
Oh the bitch is back
Stone cold sober as a matter of fact

I can bitch, I can bitch
Because I'm better than you
It's the way that I move
The things that I do, oh

[Outro]
Bitch, bitch, bitch is back
Bitch, bitch, bitch is back
Bitch, bitch, bitch is back
Bitch, bitch, bitch is back
Bitch, bitch, bitch is back
Bitch, bitch, bitch is back
Bitch, bitch, bitch is back



[Verse 1]
Blue jean baby, L.A. lady, seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile, you'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must have seen her dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me, tiny dancer in my hand

[Verse 2]
Jesus Freaks out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad

[Verse 3]
Piano man he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on she sings the songs
The words she knows the tune she hums

[Bridge]
But oh how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you and you can hear me
When I say softly slowly

[Chorus]
Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

[Verse 1 coda]
Blue jean baby, L.A. lady, seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile, you'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must have seen her dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me, tiny dancer in my hand

[Bridge]
But oh how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you and you can hear me
When I say softly slowly

[Chorus]
Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today



[Verse 1]
I took myself a blue canoe
And I floated like a leaf
Dazzling, dancing half enchanted
In my Merlin sleep
Crazy was the feeling
Restless were my eyes
Insane, they took the paddles
My arms they paralyzed

[Pre-Chorus]
So where to now, St. Peter?
If it's true I'm in your hands
I may not be a Christian
But I've done all one man can

[Chorus]
I understand I'm on the road
Where all that was is gone
So where to now, St. Peter?
Show me which road I'm on
Which road I'm on

[Verse 2]
It took a sweet young foreign gun
This lazy life is short
Something for nothing always ending
With a bad report
Dirty was the daybreak
Sudden was the change
In such a silent place as this
Beyond the rifle range

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I took myself a blue canoe



[Verse 1]
It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

[Verse 2]
If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song, and this one's for you

[Chorus]
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

[Verse 3]
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

[Verse 4]
So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

[Chorus]
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world


[Outro]
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world



[Verse 1]
I must have been through about a million girls
I'd love 'em then I'd leave 'em alone
I didn't care how much they cried, no sir
Their tears left me cold as a stone

[Chorus]
But then I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love

[Verse 2]
It used to be when I'd see a girl that I liked
I'd get out my book and write down her name
Ah, but when the, the grass got a little greener over on the other side
I'd just tear out that page

[Chorus]
But then I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love, since I met you baby
I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love

[Verse 3]
Free, on my own is the way I used to be
Ah, but since I met you baby, love's got a hold on me
(Fooled around and fell in love)
It's got a hold on me now
(Fooled around and fell in love)
I can't let go of you baby
(Fooled around and fell in love)
I can't stop loving you now
(Fooled around and fell in love)

[Outro]
Cause I fooled around, I fooled around, I fooled around, I fooled around
I fooled around, I fooled around, and I fell in love
I fooled around, I fooled around,  yes I did, I fooled around
I fooled around (and I fell in love), I fooled around
Cause I fooled around, and I fell in love
I fooled around
I fooled around, and I fell in love
Some of you know what I am trying to say



[Verse 1]
Oh, it's so funny to be seeing you after so long, girl
And with the way you look, I understand that you are not impressed
But I heard you let that little friend of mine
Take off your party dress
I'm not going to get too sentimental
Like those other sticky valentines
'Cause I don't know if you were loving somebody
I only know it isn't mine

[Chorus]
Alison, I know this world is killing you
Oh, Alison, my aim is true

[Verse 2]
Well, I see you've got a husband now
Did he leave your pretty fingers lying in the wedding cake?
You used to hold him right in your hand
I'll bet he took all he could take
Sometimes, I wish that I could stop you from talking
When I hear the silly things that you say
I think somebody better put out the big light
'Cause I can't stand to see you this way

[Chorus]
Alison, I know this world is killing you
Oh, Alison, my aim is true

[Outro]
My aim is true[repeat until fade]



[Verse 1]
I've been on tenterhooks
Ending in dirty looks
Listening to the Muzak
Thinking 'bout this 'n' that
She said that's that
I don't wanna chitter-chat
Turn it down a little bit
Or turn it down flat

[Chorus]
Pump it up when you don't really need it
Pump it up until you can feel it

[Verse 2]
Down in the pleasure center
Hell-bent or heaven sent
Listen to the propaganda
Listen to the latest slander
There's nothing underhand
That she wouldn't understand

[Chorus]
Pump it up until you can feel it
Pump it up when you don't really need it

Hey!

[Verse 3]
She's been a bad girl
She's like a chemical
Though you try to stop it
She's like a narcotic
You wanna torture her
You wanna talk to her
All the things you bought for her
Putting up your temperature

[Chorus]
Pump it up until you can feel it
Pump it up when you don't really need it

[Verse 4]
Out in the fashion show
Down in the bargain bin
You put your passion out
Under the pressure pin
Fall into submission
Hit-and-run transmission
No use wishing now for any other sin

[Chorus]
Pump it up until you can feel it
Pump it up when you don't really need it
Pump it up until you can feel it
Pump it up when you don't really need it

Pump it up until you can feel it
Pump it up when you don't really need it
Don't really need it
Don't really need it
Don't really need it



Is it all in that pretty little head of yours?
What goes on in that place in the dark?
Well, I used to know a girl and I could have sworn
That her name was Veronica

Well, she used to have a carefree mind of her own
And a delicate look in her eye
These days I'm afraid she's not even sure
If her name is Veronica

Do you suppose that waiting hands on eyes
Veronica has gone to hide?
And all the time she laughs at those
Who shout her name and steal her clothes
Veronica, Veronica

Did the days drag by? Did the favors wane?
Did he roam down the town all the while?
Will you wake from your dream, with a wolf at the door
Reaching out for Veronica?

Well, it was all of sixty-five years ago
When the world was the street where she lived
And a young man sailed on a ship in the sea
With a picture of Veronica

On the 'Empress of India'
And as she closed her eyes upon the world
And picked upon the bones of last weeks news
She spoke his name out loud again

Do you suppose that waiting hands on eyes
Veronica has gone to hide?
And all the time she laughs at those
Who shout her name and steal her clothes
Veronica, Veronica

Veronica sits in her favorite chair
She sits very quiet and still
And they call her a name that they never get right
And if they don't then nobody else will

But she used to have a carefree mind of her own
With devilish look in her eye
Saying, "You can call me anything you like
But my name is Veronica"

Do you suppose that waiting hands on eyes
Veronica has gone to hide?
And all the time she laughs at those
Who shout her name and steal her clothes
Veronica, Veronica, oh, Veronica



There might have been things I missed
But don't be unkind
It don't mean I'm blind
Perhaps there's a thing or two
I think of, lying in bed
I shouldn't have said
But there it is

You see it's all clear
You were meant to be here

From the beginning

Maybe I might've changed
And not been so cruel
Not been such a fool
Whatever was done is done
I just can't recall
It doesn't matter at all

You see it's all clear
You were meant to be here

From the beginning



Haven’t you heard this one before?
Same person being sad over three fucking chords
I can’t believe this it’s like I didn’t try
Repeating synonyms of sadness that have been used too many times

I’m a cliche, I’m a boring cliche
I’m a cliche, I’m a stupid cliche
I’m a cliche, I’m a boring cliche
I’m not special

Recycle the subjects until everything sounds the same
Every heartbreak is shitty, everyone's hometown is lame
Act like my emotions are worth writing songs about
It won’t make you any better, putting words over sounds

I’m a cliche, I’m a boring cliche
I’m a cliche, I’m a stupid cliche
I’m a cliche, I’m a boring cliche
I’m not special



[First Impression, Part One]

Cold and misty morning, I heard a warning borne in the air
About an age of power where no one had an hour to spare
Where the seeds have withered, silent children shivered in the cold
Now their faces captured in the lenses of the jackals for gold
I'll be there
I'll be there
I will be there

Suffering in silence, they've all been betrayed
They hurt them and they beat them, in a terrible way
Praying for survival at the end of the day
There is no compassion for those who stay
I'll be there!
I'll be there!
I will be there!

There must be someone who can set them free:
To take their sorrow from this odyssey
To help the helpless and the refugee
To protect what's left of humanity
Can't you see?
Can't you see?
Can't you see?

I'll be there!
I'll be there!
I will be there!

To heal their sorrow
To beg and borrow
Fight tomorrow!

[Second Impression]

(Instrumental)

[Third Impression]

Man alone, born of stone
Will stamp the dust of time
His hands strike the flame of his soul;
Ties a rope to a tree and hangs the Universe
Until the winds of laughter blows cold

Fear that rattles in men's ears
And rears its hideous head!
Dread, death in the wind

Man of steel pray and kneel
With fever's blazing torch
Thrust in the face of the night;
Draws a blade of compassion
Kissed by countless kings
Whose jeweled trumpet words blind his sight

Walls that no man thought would fall
The altars of the just
Crushed, dust in the wind

No man yields who flies in my ship
DANGER!
Let the bridge computer speak
STRANGER!
LOAD YOUR PROGRAM. I AM YOURSELF

No computer stands in my way;
Only blood can cancel my pain
Guardians of a nuclear dawn!
Let the maps of war be drawn

Rejoice! Glory is ours!
Our young men have not died in vain
Their graves need no flowers;
The tapes have recorded their names!

I am all there is!
NEGATIVE! PRIMITIVE! LIMITED! I LET YOU LIVE
But I gave you life!
WHAT ELSE COULD YOU DO?
To do what was right!
I'M PERFECT. ARE YOU?



{Intro}

He had white horses
And ladies by the score
All dressed in satin
And waiting by the door

Oooh, what a lucky man he was
Oooh, what a lucky man he was

White lace and feathers
They made up his bed
A gold covered mattress
On which he was laid

Oooh, what a lucky man he was
Oooh, what a lucky man he was

{Bridge}

He went to fight wars
For his country and his king
Of his honor and his glory
The people would sing

Oooh, what a lucky man he was
Oooh, what a lucky man he was

A bullet had found him
His blood ran as he cried
No money could save him
So he laid down and he died

Oooh, what a lucky man he was
Oooh, what a lucky man he was

{Outro}



Do you wanna be an angel
Do you wanna be a star
Do you wanna play some magic
On my guitar
Do you wanna be a poet
Do you wanna be my string
You could be anything

Do you wanna be the lover of another undercover
You could even be the
Man on the moon

Do you wanna be the player
Do you wanna be the string
Let me tell you something
It just don't mean a thing

You see it really doesn't matter
When you're buried in disguise
By the dark glass on your eyes
Though your flesh has crystallised
Still...you turn me on (oh yeah)
Still...you turn me on (ooh)
Mmm...you turn me on

Do you wanna be the pillow
Where I lay my head
Do you wanna be the feathers
Lying in my bed
Do you wanna be the cover
Of a magazine
Create a scene

Every day a little sadder
A little madder
Someone get me a ladder

Do you wanna be the singer
Do you wanna be the song
Let me tell you something
You just couldn't be more wrong

You see I really have to tell you
That it all gets so intense
From my experience
It just doesn't seem to make sense
Still...you turn me on (oh yeah)
Mmm...you turn me on (ooh yeah)
Mmm...you turn me on



[Verse]
After midnight, we're going to let it all hang down
After midnight, we're going to chug-a-lug and shout
We're going to stimulate some action
We're going to get some satisfaction
We're going to find out what it is all about
After midnight, we're going to let it all hang down

[Chorus]
After midnight, we're going to shake your tambourine
After midnight, it's all going to be peaches and cream
We're going to cause talk and suspicion
We're going to give an exhibition
We're going to find out what it is all about
After midnight, we're going to let it all hang down

[Chorus]
After midnight, we're going to let it all hang down
After midnight, we're going to shake your tambourine
After midnight, it's all going to be peaches and cream
We're going to because talk and suspicion
We're going to give an exhibition
We're going to find out what it is all about
After midnight, we're going to let it all hang down

[Outro]
After midnight, we're going to let it all hang down
After midnight, we're going to let it all hang down
After midnight, we're going to let it all hang down
After midnight, we're going to let it all hang down
After midnight



[Verse 1]
Oh, what a feeling I get when I'm with you
You take my heart into everything you do
And it makes me sad for the lonely people
I walked that road for so long
Now I know that I'm one of the lucky people
Your love is making me strong

[Chorus]
I've had enough bad love
I need something I can be proud of
I've had enough bad love
No more bad love

[Verse 2]
And now I see that my life has been so blue
With all the heartaches I had until I met you
But I'm glad to say now that is all behind me
With you here by my side
And there is no more memories to remind me
Your love will keep me alive

[Chorus][x3]



[Chorus]
Call me the breeze
I keep blowin' down the road
Well now they call me the breeze
I keep blowin' down the road
I ain't got me nobody
I don't carry me no load

[Verse 1]
Ain't no change in the weather
Ain't no changes in me
Well there ain't no change in the weather
Ain't no changes in me
And I ain't hidin' from nobody
Nobody's hidin' from me
Oh, that's the way its supposed to be

[Verse 2]
Well I got that green light baby
I got to keep movin' on
Well I got that green light baby
I got to keep movin' on
Well I might go out to California
Might go down to Georgia
I don't know

[Verse 3]
Well I dig you Georgia peaches
Makes me feel right at home
Well now I dig you Georgia peaches
Makes me feel right at home
But I don't love me no one woman
So I can't stay in Georgia long

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Oooh Mr Breeze



[Verse 1]
If you want to hang out
You've got to take her out
Cocaine
If you want to get down
Down on the ground
Cocaine

[Chorus]
She don't lie
She don't lie
She don't lie
Cocaine

[Verse 2]
If you got bad news
You want to kick the blues
Cocaine
When your day is done
And you want to ride on
Cocaine

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
She don't lie
She don't lie
She don't lie
Cocaine

[Verse 3]
If your day is gone
And you want to ride on
Cocaine
Don't forget this fact
You can't get it back
Cocaine

[Chorus]
She don't lie
She don't lie
She don't lie
Cocaine
She don't lie
She don't lie
She don't lie
Cocaine



[Verse 1: Merle Haggard]
Well, ain't no use sitting wonder why, babe
If you, don't know by now
Ain't no use sitting wonder why, babe
It'll never do anyhow
When your rooster, calls at the break of dawn
Look out your window, and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm travelling on
Don't think twice, it's alright

[Verse 2: Willie Nelson]
Ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
The light I'll never know
There ain't no use turning on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road
I wish there was something you could do, or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
But we never did too much talking anyways
So, don't think twice, it's alright

[Verse 3: Merle Haggard]
So it, ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
Like you've never done before
Ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
I can't hear you anymore
I'm thinking, and wondering, walking down the road
Onced loved a woman, child I'm told
Give her all my heart, she wanted my soul
So don’t think twice, it’s all right

[Verse 4: Willie Nelson]
I’m walking down that long, lonesome road, babe
Where I’m bound, I can’t tell
Goodbye is too good a word, babe
So I’ll just say fare thee well
I ain’t saying that you treated me unkind
You could have done better, but I don’t mind
You just sort of wasted my precious time
So, don’t think twice, it’s all right



[Verse]
How many times must I tell you babe
How many bridges I have got to cross?
How many times must I explain myself
Before I can talk to the boss?
Before I can talk to the boss?

[Chorus]
How many times must I say I love you
Before you finally understand?
Will not you be my forever woman?
I will try to be your forever man
Try to be your forever man
How many times must I say I love you
Before you finally understand?
Will not you be my forever woman?
I will try to be your forever man
Try to be your forever man

[Outro]
Forever man, forever man, forever man
Forever man, forever man, forever man
Try to be your forever man
Forever man, forever man, forever man
Forever man, forever man, forever man
Try to be your forever man



[Verse 1]
You've been told
So maybe it's time that you learned
You've been sold
Maybe it's time that you earned

[Chorus]
I can't stand it
You're fooling around, I can't stand it
You're running around, I can't stand it
You're fooling around with my heart

[Verse 2]
I'll explain
I feel like I'm being used
Make it plain
So you don't get confused

[Chorus][x2]

[Verse 3]
It's time
Time for me to let you know
It's no crime
No crime to let your feelings show

[Chorus]



[Chorus 1]
I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy
I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy

[Verse 1]
All around in my home town
They're trying to track me down
They say they want to bring me in guilty
For the killing of a deputy
For the life of a deputy
But I say

[Chorus 2]
I shot the sheriff, but I swear it was in self-defense
I shot the sheriff, and they say it is a capital offense

[Verse 2]
Sheriff John Brown always hated me
For what I don't know
Every time that I plant a seed
He said, "Kill it before it grows"
He said, "Kill it before it grows"
I say

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 3]
Freedom came my way one day
And I started out of town
All of a sudden I see sheriff John Brown
Aiming to shoot me down
So I shot, I shot him down
I say

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 4]
Reflexes got the better of me
And what is to be must be
Every day the bucket goes to the well
But one day the bottom will drop out
Yes, one day the bottom will drop out
But I say

[Chorus 1]



[Verse 1]
I've got a feeling we could be serious, girl
Right at this moment, I could promise you the world
Before we go crazy, before we explode
There's something about me, baby, you got to know
You got to know

[Chorus]
I get off on '57 Chevys
I get off on screaming guitar
Like the way it hits me every time it hits me
I've got a rock and roll, I've got a rock and roll heart

[Verse 2]
Feels like we're falling into the arms of the night
So if you're not ready, don't be holding me so tight
I guess there's nothing left for me to explain
Here's what you're getting and I don't want to change
I don't want to change

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I don't need to glitter, no Hollywood
All you got to do is lay it down and you lay it down good

[Chorus]



[Pre-Chorus]
It's in the way that you use it
It comes and it goes
It's in the way that you use it
Boy don't you know

[Chorus]
And if you lie you will lose it
Feelings will show
So don't you ever abuse it
Don't let it go

[Verse 1]
Nobody's right until somebody's wrong
Nobody's weak until somebody's strong
No one gets lucky until luck comes along
Nobody's lonely until somebody's gone

[Pre-Chorus]
It's in the way that you use it
It comes and it goes
It's in the way that you use it
Boy don't you know
It's in the way that you use it
It comes and it goes
It's in the way that you use it
Boy don't you know

[Chorus]
And if you lie you will lose it
Feelings will show
So don't you ever abuse it
Don't let it go

[Verse 2]
I've seen dark skies, never like this
Walked on some thin ice, never like this
I've told you white lies, never like this
Looked into true eyes, never like this

[Pre-Chorus]
It's in the way that you use it
Boy don't you know
It's in the way that you use it
Boy don't you know



[Verse 1]
There is nothing that is wrong
In wanting you to stay here with me
I know you've got somewhere to go
But won't you make yourself at home and stay with me?
And don't you ever leave

[Chorus]
Lay down, Sally and rest you in my arms
Don't you think you want someone to talk to?
Lay down, Sally, no need to leave so soon
I've been trying all night long just to talk to you

[Verse 2]
Sun isn't nearly on the rise
We still got the moon and stars above
Underneath the velvet skies love is all that matters
Won't you stay with me? Don't you ever leave

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I long to see the morning light
Coloring your face so dreamily
So don't you go and say goodbye
You can lay your worries down and stay with me
Don't you ever leave

[Chorus][x2]



[Verse 1]
Standing at the crossroads, trying to read the signs
To tell me which way I should go to find the answer
And all the time I know
Plant your love and let it grow

[Chorus]
Let it grow, let it grow
Let it blossom, let it flow
In the sun, the rain, the snow
Love is lovely, let it grow

[Verse 2]
Looking for a reason to check out of my mind
Trying hard to get a friend that I can count on
But there's nothing left to show
Plant your love and let it grow

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Time is getting shorter and there's much for you to do
Only ask and you will get what you are needing
The rest is up to you
Plant your love and let it grow

[Chorus][x2]



[Verse 1]
The rain is falling through the mist
Of sorrow that surrounded me
The sun could never thaw away
The bliss that lays around me

[Chorus]
Let it rain, let it rain
Let your love rain down on me
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, rain, rain

[Verse 2]
Her life was like a desert flower
Burning in the sun
Until I found the way to love
It's harder said than done

[Chorus]
Let it rain, let it rain
Let your love rain down on me
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, rain, rain

[Verse 3]
Now I know the secret
There is nothing that I lack
If I give my love to you
You'll surely give it back

[Chorus]
Let it rain, let it rain
Let your love rain down on me
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, rain, rain
Let it rain, let it rain
Let your love rain down on me
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, rain, rain

Rain, rain, rain, rain
Rain, rain, rain, rain



[Verse 1]
How many times must we tell the tale?
How many times must we fall?
Living in lost memory
You just recalled

Working on the sound of the band
Trying to get the music right
Two go out working
Three stay home at night

[Chorus]
That is when she said she was pretending
Like she knew the plan
That is when I knew she was pretending
Pretending to understand
Pretending, pretending
Pretending, pretending

[Verse 2]
Satisfied but lost in love
Situations change
You are never who you used to think you are
How strange

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I get lost in alibis
Sadness cannot prevail
Everybody knows strong love
Can't fail

[Bridge]
Don't be pretending about how you feel
Don't be pretending that your love is real
Don't be pretending about how you feel
Don't be pretending that your love is real

[Outro]
Pretending, pretending
Pretending, pretending



[Chorus]
She is waiting for another love
She is waiting for another love

[Verse 1]
She has been waiting for another love
Someone that she can show into her heart
And when she finally finds a stronger love
Your whole world is going to fall apart

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
You have been abusing her for far too long
Think you are a king and she is your pawn
Get ready now, cause pretty soon
She will be gone and you will be on your own

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I see the hunger burning in her eye
Any fool could see there is something wrong
You keep pretending not to care
But I will hear you sing a different song

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Waiting for another lover
Hoping for the time that she will find another



[Verse 1]
Would you know my name
If I saw you in heaven?
Would you feel the same
If I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong and carry on
Because I know I don't belong here in heaven

[Verse 2]
Would you hold my hand
If I saw you in heaven?
Would you help me stand
If I saw you in heaven?
I'll find my way through night and day
Because I know I just can't stay here in heaven

[Bridge]
Time can bring you down, time can bend your knees
Time can break your heart, have you begging please, begging please
Beyond the door there's peace I'm sure
And I know there'll be no more tears in heaven

[Verse 3]
Would you know my name
If I saw you in heaven?
Would you feel the same
If I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong and carry on
Because I know I don't belong here in heaven



[Verse 1]
Every morning when I wake, a feeling soon begins to overtake me
Ringing in my ears resounds through my brain; it finally surrounds me
There is fire, there is life, there is passion, fever and fury
There is love and there is hate, there is longing, anger and worry

[Chorus 1]
Oh, I have a flame, feel it touch my heart
And down at my core is the hottest part
I can burn without fuel

[Verse 2]
If it should become too cold, I know I can endure the frostbite
Oh, a blanket then I'll wrap around me; I keep myself so close to my side
No one then can cause me harm, just as the river runs into the sea
Because every day, your fire alarm is deafening the silence all around me

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
It is burning
It is burning

[Verse 3]
You can trust me, we can laugh. Together we can share our sorrow
I will give you secrets too, an attitude that you may borrow
Gypsy woman said to me, one thing you must bear in your mind
You are young and you are free, but damned if you're deceased in your own lifetime

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]



[Verse 1]
I know a cat named Way-Out Willie
Got a cool little chick named Rocking Millie
He can walk and stroll and Susie Q
And do that crazy hand jive, too

Mama, mama, look at Uncle Joe
Doing the hand jive with sister Flo
Grandma gave baby sister a dime
Said, "Do that hand jive one more time!"

[Chorus]
Hand jive, hand jive, hand jive
Do that crazy hand jive

[Verse 2]
Doctor and a lawyer and an Indian chief
They all dig that crazy beat
Way-Out Willie gave them all a treat
When he did that hand jive with his feet

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Willie and Millie got married last fall
They had a little Willie junior and that isn't all
Well, the kids got crazy and it's plain to see
Doing the hand jive on T.V

[Chorus]



[Verse]
It's late in the evening she's wondering what clothes to wear
She puts on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair
And then she asks me, "Do I look all right?"
And I say, "Yes, you look wonderful tonight"

[Verse]
We go to a party and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady that's walking around with me
And then she asks me "Do you feel all right?"
And I say, "Yes, I feel wonderful tonight"

[Bridge]
I feel wonderful because I see
The love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize how much I love you

[Verse]
It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head
So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed
And then I tell her, as I turn out the light
I say, "My darling, you were wonderful tonight
Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight"

[Verse 1:Joey Tempest]
We're leaving together
But still it's farewell
And maybe we'll come back
To Earth, who can tell?
I guess there is no one to blame
We're leaving ground (leaving ground)
Will things ever be the same again?

[Hook]
It's the final countdown
The final countdown
Ohh

[Verse 2:Joey Tempest]
We're heading for Venus (Venus)
And still we stand tall
Cause maybe they've seen us
And welcome us, all yeah
With so many lightyears to go
And things to be found (to be found)
I'm sure that we'll all miss her so

[Hook]
It's the final countdown
The final countdown
The final countdown (final countdown)

The final countdown
It's the final countdown
The final countdown
The final countdown (final countdown)
Ohhh. It's the final countdown
We're leaving together. (The final countdown)
We'll all miss her so
It's the final countdown (Final countdown)

[Outro]
It's the final countdown



Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
I've traveled the world and the 7 seas
Everybody's looking for something

Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused

Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
I've traveled the world and the 7 seas
Everybody's looking for something

Hold your head up
Keep your head up, moving on
Hold your head up, moving on
Keep your head up, moving on
Hold your head up, moving on
Keep your head up, movin' on
Hold your head up, movin' on
Keep your head up

Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused

Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
I travel the world
And the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something

Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
I travel the world
And the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something

Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
I travel the world
And the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something

Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
I travel the world
And the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something

Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
I travel the world
And the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something

Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
I travel the world
And the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something



[Chorus]
I would swallow my pride
I would choke on the rinds
But the lack thereof would leave me empty inside
Swallow my doubt, turn it inside out
Find nothin' but faith in nothin'
Want to put my tender
Heart in a blender
Watch it spin 'round to a beautiful oblivion
Rendezvous, then I'm through with you

I burn, burn like a wicker cabinet
Chalk white and oh-so-frail
I see our time has gotten stale
The tick-tock of the clock is painful
All sane and logical
I want to tear it off the wall
I hear words and clips and phrases
I think sick like ginger ale
My stomach turns and I exhale

[Chorus]
I would swallow my pride
I would choke on the rinds
But the lack thereof would leave me empty inside
I would swallow my doubt, turn it inside out
Find nothin' but faith in nothin'
Want to put my tender
Heart in a blender
Watch it spin 'round to a beautiful oblivion
Rendezvous, and I'm through with you

[Verse 2]
So-Cal is where my mind states
But it's not my state of mind
I'm not as ugly, sad as you
Or am I origami, folded up and just pretend
Demented as the motives in your head

[Chorus]
I would swallow my pride
I would choke on the rinds
But the lack thereof would leave me empty inside
I would swallow my doubt, turn it inside out
Find nothin' but faith in nothin'
Want to put my tender
Heart in a blender
Watch it spin 'round to a beautiful oblivion
Rendezvous, and I'm through with you

[Bridge]
I alone am the one you don't know you need
Take heed, feed your ego
Make me blind when your eyes close
Sink when you get close, tie me to the bedpost
I alone am the one you don't know you need
You don't know you need me
Make me blind when your eyes close
Tie me to the bedpost

[Chorus]
I would swallow my pride
I would choke on the rinds
But the lack thereof would leave me empty inside
Swallow my doubt, turn it inside out
Find nothing but faith in nothing
Want to put my tender
Heart in a blender
Watch it spin 'round to a beautiful oblivion
Rendezvous, then I'm through, now I'm through with you

[Outro]
Through with you
Rendezvous, then I'm through with you



[Instrumental break]
[Verse 1]
I am still living with your ghost
Lonely and dreaming of the west coast
I don't want to be your downtime
I don't want to be your stupid game

[Verse 2]
With my big black boots and an old suitcase
I do believe I'll find myself a new place
I don't want to be the bad guy
I don't want do your sleepwalk dance anymore
I just want to see some palm trees
I will try and shake away this disease

[Hook]
We can live beside the ocean
Leave the fire behind
Swim out past the breakers
Watch the world die
We can live beside the ocean
Leave the fire behind
Swim out past the breakers
Watch the world die

[Verse 3]
I am still dreaming of your face
Hungry and hollow for all the things you took away
I don't want to be your good time
I don't want to be your fall-back crutch anymore

[Verse 4]
I'll walk right out into a brand new day
Insane and rising in my own weird way
I don't want to be the bad guy
I don't want to do your sleepwalk dance anymore

I just want to feel some sunshine
I just want to find some place to be alone

[Hook]
We can live beside the ocean
Leave the fire behind
Swim out past the breakers
Watch the world die



Guess who just got back today?
Them wild-eyed boys that'd been away
Haven't changed, had much to say
But man, I still think them cats are crazy
They were askin' if you were around
How you was, where you could be found
Told them you were livin' downtown
Drivin' all the old men crazy

The boys are back in town
(the boys are back in town)
I said The boys are back in town (The boys are back in town)
The boys are back in town
(the boys are back in town)
The boys are back in town
(the boys are back in town)

You know that chick that used to dance a lot
Every night, she'd be on the floor, shakin' what she's got
Man, when I tell ya she was cool, she was red hot
I mean she was steamin'
And that time over at Johnny's place
Well, this chick got up and she
Slapped Johnny's face
Man, we just fell about the place
If that chick don't wanna know, forget her
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
I said The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town

The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town

{Instrumental}

Spread the word around guess who's back in town
You spread the word around

Friday night they'll be dressed to kill
Down at Dino's bar and grill
The drink will flow, and blood will spill
And if the boys wanna fight you
Better let 'em
That jukebox in the corner
Blasting out my favorite song
The nights are gettin' warmer
It won't be long
Won't be long 'til summer comes
Now that the boys are here again

The boys are back in town
(the boys are back in town)
The boys are back in town
(the boys are back in town)
The boys are back in town
(the boys are back in town)
Spread the word around

The boys are back in town
(the boys are back in town)
The boys are back, the boys are back
The boys are back in town again
They're hangin' down at Dino's
The boys are back in town again!



[Verse 1]
We've all seen the man at the liquor store beggin' for your change
The hair on his face is dirty, dreadlocked and full of mange
He ask the man for what he could spare with shame in his eyes
"Get a job, you fucking slob" is all he replies

[Hook]
God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in his shoes
Cause then you really might know what it's like to sing the blues
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)

[Verse 2]
Mary got pregnant from a kid named Tom who said he was in love
He said. "Don't worry about a thing, baby doll
I'm the man you've been dreamin' of."
But three months later he said he won't date her or return her calls
And she sweared, "Goddamn, if I find that man, I'm cuttin' off his balls!"
And then she heads for the clinic and she gets some static walkin' through the door:
They call her a killer, and they call her a sinner, and they call her a whore!

[Hook 2]
God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in her shoes
Cause then you really might know what it's like to have to choose
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)

[Bridge]
I've seen a rich man beg
I've seen a good man sin
I've seen a tough man cry
I've seen a loser win
And a sad man grin
I heard an honest man lie
I've seen the good side of bad
And the down side of up
And everything between
I licked the silver spoon
Drank from the golden cup
Smoked the finest green

I stroked the baddest dimes
At least a couple of times
Before I broke their heart

You know where it ends
Yo, it usually depends
On where you start

[Verse 3]
I knew this kid named Max
He used to get fat stacks out on the corner with drugs
He liked to hang out late at night
Liked to get shit faced
And keep pace with thugs

Until late one night there was a big gunfight
Max lost his head
He pulled out his chrome .45
Talked some shit
And wound up dead

Now his wife and his kids are caught in the midst of all of his pain
You know it comes that way
At least that's what they say
When you play the game

[Hook]
God forbid you ever had to wake up to hear the news
Cause then you really might know what it's like to have to lose
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)
To have to lose...



[Verse 1: Gary Cherone]
Saying I love you
Is not the words I want to hear from you
It's not that I want you
Not to say, but if you only knew
How easy it would be to show me how you feel
More than words is all you have to do to make it real
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
'Cause I'd already know

[Chorus]
What would you do if my heart was torn in two?
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real
What would you say if I took those words away?
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying I love you

More than words

[Verse 2: Gary Cherone]
Now that I've tried to talk to you and make you understand
All you have to do is close your eyes
And just reach out your hands and touch me
Hold me close don't ever let me go
More than words is all I ever needed you to show
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
'Cause I'd already know

[Chorus]
What would you do if my heart was torn in two?
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real
What would you say if I took those words away?
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying I love you
More than words
More than words
More than words
More than words

More than words



Mutha, don't wanna go to school today
I think I'd rather go outside and play, yeah
They keep calling, asking me if I'll come in, is that a sin?
If being lazy is the only reason
It's getting late, so Mutha, don't you hesitate
To pack my lunch and I'll be on my way to school
Mutha, don't wanna go to school today
I think, I'd rather go outside and play, yeah
Mutha, don't wanna go to school today
I think I'd rather go outside and play
Teacher's always looking down with her disappointed frown
Asking me to go sleep somewhere else
My levelheaded Mutha, always said to one another
That the truth will always hurt if you keep waiting
I said waiting
Mutha, don't wanna go to school today
I think I'd rather go outside and play, yeah
Mutha, don't wanna go to school today
I think I'd rather go outside and play
Mutha, don't wanna go to school today
I think I'd rather go outside and play, yeah
C'mon, mutha, don't wanna go to school today
I think I'd rather go outside and play
Mutha, don't wanna go to school today
I think I'd rather go outside and play, yeah
Mutha, don't wanna go to school today
I think I'd rather go outside and play

Poor old Grandad
I laughed at all his words
I thought he was a bitter man
He spoke of women's ways
"They trap you, then they use you
Before you even know
Well, love is blind and you're far too kind
Don't ever let it show"

I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was younger
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger

The can-can such a pretty show
Will steal your heart away
But backstage back on earth again
The dressing rooms are grey
They come on strong and it ain't too long
'Fore they make you feel a man
But love is blind and you soon will find
You're just a boy again

When you want her lips, you get her cheek
Makes you wonder where you are
If you want some more then she's fast asleep
Leaves you twinkling with the stars
Poor young grandson, there's nothing I can say
You'll have to learn, just like me
And that's the hardest way, ooh la la
Ooh la la la la, yeah

I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was younger
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger



In the mornin' don't say you love me
Cause I'll only kick you out of the door
I know your name is Rita cause your perfume's smelling sweeter
Since when I saw you down on the floor, guitar

You won't need too much pursuadin'
I don't mean to sound degradin'
But with a face like that
You got nothin' to laugh about

Red lips, hair and fingernails
I hear you're a mean old jezebel
Lets go up stairs
And read my tarot cards, come on

[Chorus]
Stay with me, stay with me
For tonight you'd better stay with me, oh yeah
Stay with me, stay with me
For tonight you'd better stay with me

So, in the mornin', please don't say you love me
Cause you know I'll only kick you out the door
Yeah, I'll pay your cab fare home, you can even use my best cologne
Just don't be here in the mornin' when I wake up, come on, honey

[Chorus]
Stay with me, stay with me
Cause tonight you're gonna stay with me
Sit down, get up, get out
Stay with me, stay with me
Cause tonight you're gonna stay with me
Hey what's your name again

Get out



[Verse 1]
Can you feel it, see it, hear it today?
If you can't, then it doesn't matter anyway
You will never understand it, cause it happens too fast
And it feels so good, it's like walking on glass
It's so cool, it's so hip, it's alright
It's so groovy, it's outta sight
You can touch it, smell it, taste it, so sweet
But it makes no difference cause it knocks you off your feet

[Chorus 1]
You want it all, but you can't have it

[Verse 2]
It's cryin', bleedin', lyin' on the floor
So you lay down on it and you do it some more
You've got to share it, so you dare it
Then you bare it and you tear it

[Chorus 2]
You want it all, but you can't have it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's in your face but you can't grab it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3]
It's alive, afraid, a lie, a sin
It's magic, it's tragic, it's a loss, it's a win
It's dark, it's moist, it's a bitter pain
It's sad, it happened, and it's a shame

[Chorus 3]
You want it all, but you can't have it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's in your face, but you can't grab it

[Bridge 1]
What is it?
It's it
What is it?
It's it
What is it?
It's it
What is it?
It's it
What is it?
It's it
What is it?

What is it?
It's it
What is it?

[Hook]
You want it all, but you can't have it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's in your face, but you can't grab it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Bridge 2]
It's it
What is it?

A little past suppertime
I'm still out on the porch step sitting on my behind
Waiting for you

Wondering if everything is alright
Momma said, "Come in boy, don't waste your time." I said, "I've got time
Well, he'll be here soon."

Five years old and talking to myself
Where were you? Where'd you go?
Daddy, can't you tell?

I'm not trying to fake it
And I ain't the one to blame
There's no one home
In my house of pain
I didn't write these pages
And my script's been rearranged
No, there's no one home
In my house of pain

Wasn't I worth the time?
A boy needs a daddy like a dance to mime and all the time
I looked up to you

I paced my room a million times
And all I ever got was on big line, the same old lie
How could you?

Well, I was eighteen and still talking to myself
Where were you? Where'd you go?
Daddy can't you tell?

I'm not trying to fake it
And I ain't the one to blame
There's no one home
In my house of pain
I didn't write these pages
And my script's been rearranged
No, there's no one home
In my house of pain

I'm not trying to fake it
And I ain't the one to blame
There's no one home
In my house of pain
I didn't write these pages
And my script's been rearranged
No, there's no one home
In my house of pain

And I'm alone again


Well, if I learned anything from this...it's how to live on my own



They say our love was never meant to be
That time would make it just a memory
But they don't know, how can they understand?
We didn't build no castles in the sand

And all the king's horses
All the king's men
Couldn't storm this tower
Of love, my friend
Of love, my friend

They say our life was just a fairy tale
No matter how we try, we must surely fail
But where are they now? And could they ever understand?
This ivory tower was built on rock, not sand

And all the king's horses, baby
All the king's men
Couldn't storm this tower
Of love, my friend
Of love, my friend

All the king's horses
And all the king's men
Couldn't storm this tower
Of love, my friend, yeah

All the king's horses, yeah yeah
All the king's men
Couldn't storm this tower
Of love, my friend

All (all), all the king's horses
All (all), all the king's men
Yeah, yeah, yeah



And the sign says "long hair freaky people need not apply"
So I put my hair under my hat and I went in to ask him why
He said you look like a fine outstanding young man I think you'll do
So I took off my hat I said "Imagine that Huh Me working for you"

Signs Signs
Everywhere there's signs
Fucking up the scenery
Breaking my mind
Do this, don't do that
Can't you read the sign

And the sign says "Anybody caught trespassing will be shot on sight"
So I jumped the fence and I yelled at the house, Hey! What gives you the right
To put up a fence And keep me out Or to keep Mother Nature in
If God was here He'd tell it to your face Man You're some kind of sinner

Signs Signs
Everywhere there's signs
Fucking up the scenery
Breaking my mind
Do this, don't do that

Oh Say now mister Can't you read
You got to have a shirt and tie to get a seat
You can't watch No You can't eat You ain't supposed to be here

And the sign says "You got to have a membership card to get inside" Huh

And the sign says "Everybody welcome Come in Kneel down and pray"
But then they passed around a plate at the end of it all
And I didn't have a penny to pay
So I got me a pen and paper And I made up my own little sign
I said Thank you Lord for thinking about me I'm alive and doing fine

Signs Signs

[Verse 1]
It was a blue letter she wrote to me
It's silver words she told
Wanna be on the road to paradise
I want a lover who don't get old

[Chorus 1]
Do I read a message in your eyes
You want a love to stay another night
Baby, when your day goes down
I won't be waiting around for you

[Chorus 2]
For every voice you ever heard
There's a thousand without a word
Redbird, don't say you told me so
Give me one more song to go

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Outro]
I ain't waiting [x9]



[Verse 1: Lindsey Buckingham]
If you wake up and don’t want to smile
If it takes just a little while
Open your eyes and look at the day
You’ll see things in a different way

[Chorus: Buckingham and C. McVie]
Don’t stop thinking about tomorrow
Don’t stop, it’ll soon be here
It’ll be better than before
Yesterday’s gone, yesterday’s gone

[Verse 2: Christine McVie]
Why not think about times to come?
And not about the things that you’ve done?
If your life was bad to you
Just think what tomorrow will do

[Chorus: Buckingham and C. McVie]
Don’t stop thinking about tomorrow
Don’t stop, it’ll soon be here
It’ll be better than before
Yesterday’s gone, yesterday’s gone

[Verse 3: Buckingham and C. McVie]
All I want is to see you smile
If it takes just a little while
I know you don’t believe that it’s true
I never meant any harm to you

[Chorus: Buckingham and C. McVie]
Don’t stop thinking about tomorrow
Don’t stop, it’ll soon be here
It’ll be better than before
Yesterday’s gone, yesterday’s gone

[Chorus: Buckingham and C. McVie]
Don’t stop thinking about tomorrow
Don’t stop, it’ll soon be here
It’ll be better than before
Yesterday’s gone, yesterday’s gone

Don’t you look back

Don’t you look back

Don’t you look back



[Verse 1]
World turns black and white
Pictures in an empty room
Your love starts falling down
Better change your tune, yeah!
You reach for the golden ring
Reach for the sky
Baby just spread your wings

[Chorus]
We'll get higher and higher straight up we'll climb
We'll get higher and higher leave it all behind


[Verse 2]
Run, run, run, away
Like a train runnin' off the track
The truth gets left behind
And falls between the cracks
Standing on broken dreams
Never losing sight, oh!
Well just spread your wings

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
So baby dry your eyes, save all the tears you've cried
Ohh that's what dreams are made of
Cause we belong in a world that must be strong
Ohh that's what dreams are made of

[Solo]

[Chorus variation]
We'll get higher and higher straight up we'll climb
Higher and higher leave it all behind
Oh, we'll get higher and higher who knows what we'll find

[Outro]
So baby dry your eyes, save all the tears you've cried
Ohh, that's what dreams are made of
Ohh, baby we belong in a world that must be strong
Ohh, that's what dreams are made of

And in the end on dreams we will depend
Cause thats what love is made of



[Verse 1 - Fleetwood Mac]
Loving you isn't the right thing to do
How can I ever change things that I feel?
If I could maybe I'd give you my world
How can I when you won't take it from me?

[Chorus - Fleetwood Mac]
You can go your own way (go your own way)
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way (go your own way)

[Verse 2 - Fleetwood Mac]
Tell me why everything turned around
Packing up shacking up's all you wanna do
If I could baby I'd give you my world
Open up everything's waiting for you

[Chorus - Fleetwood Mac]
You can go your own way (go your own way)
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way (go your own way)

[Mini Bridge]

[Chorus - Fleetwood Mac]
You can go your own way (go your own way)
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way (go your own way)
You can go your own way (go your own way)
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way (go your own way)

[Bridge]

[Chorus - Fleetwood Mac]
You can go your own way (go your own way)
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way (go your own way)



[Verse 1]
Rock on, Gold Dust Woman
Take your silver spoon, dig your grave
Heartless challenge
Pick your path and I’ll pray
Wake up in the morning
See your sunrise, loves to go down
Lousy lovers pick their prey
But they never cry out loud, cry out

[Chorus]
Well, did she make you cry
Make you break down
Shatter your illusions of love?
And is it over now? Do you know how?
Pick up the pieces and go home

[Verse 2]
Rock on, ancient queen
Follow those who pale in your shadow
Rulers make bad lovers
You better put your kingdom up for sale
Up for sale

[Chorus]
Well, did she make you cry
Make you break down
Shatter your illusions of love?
And is it over now? Do you know how?
Pick up the pieces and go home

[Chorus: Variation]
But did she make you cry
Make you break down
Shatter your illusions of love?
And now tell me, is it over now?
Do you know how to pick up the pieces
And go home? Go home, go home

[Outro]
Ooh, pale shadow of a woman
Black widow
Pale shadow of a dragon
Dust woman
Ooh, pale shadow of a woman
Ooh, black widow
Ooh, pale shadow, she’s a dragon
Gold Dust Woman
Woman, woman

[Verse 1]
Can you understand me
Baby, don't you hand me a line
Although it doesn't matter
You and me got plenty of time
There's nobody in the future
So baby let me hand you my love
There's no step for you to dance to
So slip your hand inside of my glove

[Chorus]
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me

[Verse 2]
I don't want no damage
But how'm I going to manage with you
You hold the percentage
But I'm the fool paying the dues
I'm just around the corner
If you got a minute to spare
I'll be waiting for you
If you ever want to be there

[Chorus]



[Chorus]
I don’t want to know the reasons why love keeps
Right on walking down that line
I don't want to stand between you and love
Honey, I just want you to feel fine
I don’t want to know the reasons why love keeps
Right on walking down that line
I don't want to stand between you and love
Honey, I just want you to feel fine
Finally baby
The truth has come down now
Take a listen to your spirit
It’s crying out loud
Try to believe
Oh you say you love me but you don't know
You got me rocking and a-reeling
Oh, oh, yeah, ah, ah, ah
I don’t want to know the reasons why love keeps
Right on walking down that line
I don't want to stand between you and love
Honey, I just want you to feel fine
I don’t want to know the reasons why love keeps
Right on walking down that line
I don't want to stand between you and love
Honey, I just want you to feel fine

[Chorus 2]
Finally baby
The truth has been told
Now you tell me that I’m crazy
It’s nothing that I didn’t know
Finally baby
The truth has been told
Now you tell me that I’m crazy
It’s nothing that I didn’t know
Trying to survive
Oh, you say you love me, but you don’t know
You got me rocking and a-reeling
Hanging on to you
Oh yeah, Uh, huh

[Chorus]
I don’t want to know the reasons why love keeps
Right on walking down that line
I don't want to stand between you and love, honey
Take a little time

[Outro]
Ah, I don’t want to know



[Verse 1]
I've been alone
All the years
So many ways to count the tears

[Pre-Chorus]
I never change
I never will
I'm so afraid the way I feel

[Chorus]
Days when the rain and the sun are gone
Black as night
Agony's torn at my heart too long
So afraid
Slip and I fall and I die

[Verse 2]
I been alone
Always down
No one cared to stay around

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]



I took my love and took it down
I climbed a mountain, i turned around
And i saw my reflection in a snow covered hill
'til the landslide brought it down

Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can i sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can i handle the seasons of my life?

Well, i've been afraid of changing cause i've
Built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Even children get older
And I'm getting older, too

Well, i've been afraid of changing cause i've
Built my life around you
Time makes you bolder
Even children get older
And I'm getting older, too
I'm getting older, too

I took my love and took it down
I climbed a mountain, i turned around
And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hill
The landslide brought it down
The landslide brought it down

[Verse 1: Christine McVie]
If I could turn the page
In time then I'd rearrange
Just a day or two
Close my, close my, close my eyes
But I couldn't find a way
So I'll settle for one day
To believe in you
Tell me, tell me, tell me lies

[Chorus: Christine McVie]
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
(Tell me lies, tell me, tell me lies)
Oh, no, no you can't disguise
(You can't disguise, no you can't disguise)
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies

[Verse 2: Christine McVie]
Although I'm not making plans
I hope that you understand
There's a reason why
Close your, close your, close your eyes
No more broken hearts
We're better off apart
Let's give it a try
Tell me, tell me, tell me lies

[Chorus: Christine McVie]
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
(Tell me lies, tell me, tell me lies)
Oh, no, no you can't disguise
(You can't disguise, no you can't disguise)
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies

{​Bridge}​

[Verse 3: Christine McVie]
If I could turn the page

[Chorus: Christine McVie]

[Verse 1]
Monday morning you look so fine
Friday I got travelin on my mind
First you love me, then you fade away
I can't go on believing this way
I got nothing but love for you
So tell me what you really want to do
First you love me then you get on down the line
But I don't mind
I dont't mind

[Chorus]
I'll be there if you want me to
No one else that could ever do
Got to get some peace in my mind

[Verse 2]
Monday morning you look so fine
Friday I got travelin on my mind
First you love me then you say it's wrong
I can't go on believing for long
But you know it's true
You only want me when I get over you
First you love me then you get on down the line
But I don't mind
I don't mind

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
But you know it's true
You only want me when I get over you
First you love me then you get on down the line
But I don't mind
I don't mind

[Chorus]



[Verse 1]
She broke down and let me in
Made me see where I’d been

[Chorus]
Been down one time
Been down two times
I’m never going back again

[Verse 2]
You don’t know what it means to win
Come round and see me again

[Chorus]
Been down one time
Been down two times
I’m never going back again



[Verse 1]
I can't help about the shape I'm in
Can't sing, I ain't pretty and my legs are thin
But don't ask me what I think of you
I might not give the answer that you want me to
Oh, well

[Verse 2]
Now, when I talked to God, I knew He'd understand
He said, "Stick by my side and I'll be your guiding hand
Don't ask me what I think of you
I might not give the answer that you want me to"
Well

[Chorus]
Oh, well, oh, well
Well, well, well, well



{Intro}

Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night
And wouldn't you love to love her?
Takes to the sky like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover?

All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?

She is like a cat in the dark
And then she is the darkness
She rules her life like a fine skylark
And when the sky is starless

{Added in later versions}
Once in a million years a lady like her rises
Oh no, Rhiannon, you cry, but she's gone
Your life knows no answer, your life knows no answer}

All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?
Will you ever win?

Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon

She rings like a bell through the night
And wouldn't you love to love her?
She rules her life like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover?

All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?
Will you ever win?

Taken by the sky

Dreams unwind
Love's a state of mind
Dreams unwind
Love's a state of mind



[Verse 1]
Wait a minute baby
Stay with me awhile
Said you'd give me light
But you never told be about the fire

[Chorus 1]
Drowning in the sea of love
Where everyone would love to drown
And now it's gone
It doesn't matter anymore
When you build your house
Call me home

[Verse 2]
And he was just like a great dark wing
Within the wings of a storm
I think I had met my match -- he was singing
And undoing the laces [2x]

[Chorus 2]
Sara, you're the poet in my heart
Never change, never stop
And now it's gone
It doesn't matter what for
When you build your house
Call me home

[Verse 3]
Hold on
The night is coming and the starling flew for days
I'd stay home at night all the time
I'd go anywhere, anywhere
Ask me and I'm there because I care

[Chorus 1]
Drowning in the sea of love
Where everyone would love to drown
And now it's gone
They say it doesn't matter anymore
If you build your house
Then please, call me home

[Chorus 2]
Sara, your the poet in my heart
Never change, and no she'll never stop
And now it's gone
No, it doens't matter anymore
When you build your house
I'll come by

[Outro]
Sara
All I ever wanted, was to know that you were dreaming, Sara
There’s a heartbeat that never really died
Oh, won't you swallow your pride?



{Intro}

Have mercy, baby, on a poor girl like me
You know I'm falling, falling, falling at your feet
I'm tingling right from my head to my toes
So help me, help me, help me make the feeling go

Because when the loving starts, and the lights go down
And there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me

Have pity baby just when I thought it was over
Now you got me running, running, running for cover
I'm begging you for a little sympathy
And if you use me again it'll be the end of me

Because when the loving starts, and the lights go down
And there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me

{Bridge}

Baby, baby, hope you're going to stay away
Because I'm getting weaker, weaker everyday
I guess I'm not as strong as I used to be
And if you use me again it'll be the end of me

Because when the loving starts, and the lights go down
And there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me

Because when the loving starts, and the lights go down
And there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me

Say that you love me
Say that you love me

{Outro}

Falling, falling, falling
Falling, falling, falling...



[Verse 1]
I know there’s nothing to say
Someone has taken my place
When times go bad
When times go rough
Won’t you lay me down in tall grass
And let me do my stuff?

[Verse 2]
I know I got nothing on you
I know there’s nothing to do
When times go bad
And you can’t get enough
Won’t you lay me down in the tall grass
And let me do my stuff?

[Chorus]
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-buh-bow
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-buh-bow
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-bow bow, bow bow, doo da doodladoo
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-buh-bow
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-buh-bow
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-bow bow, bow bow, yeah

[Verse 3]
One thing I think you should know
I ain't gonna miss you when you go
Been down so long
I’ve been tossed around enough
Couldn’t you just
Let me go down and do my stuff?

[Verse 4]
I know you’re hoping to find
Someone who’s going to give you peace of mind
When times go bad
When times go rough
Won’t you lay me down in tall grass
And let me do my stuff?

[Chorus]
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-buh-bow
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-buh-bow
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-bow bow, bow bow, doo da doodladoo
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-buh-bow

Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-bow bow, bow bow

[Outro]
I’m just second-hand news
I’m just second-hand news, yeah
I’m just second-hand news
I’m just second-hand news, yeah
I’m just second-hand news
I’m just second-hand news, yeah
I’m just second-hand news
I’m just second-hand news, yeah
Yeah



[Chorus 1]
You are here and warm but I could look away and you'd be gone
Because we live in a time when meaning falls in splinters from our lives
And that's why I've traveled far because I come so together where you are

[Chorus 2]
And all of the things that I said that I wanted
Come rushing by in my head when I'm with you
Fourteen joys and a will to be merry
All of the things that we say are very

[Chorus 3][x2]
Sentimental gentle wind blowing through my life again
Sentimental lady, gentle one

[Verse 1]
Now you are here today but easily you might just go away
Because we live in a time when paintings have no color, words don't rhyme
And that's why I've traveled far because I come so together where you are

[Chorus 2]
Yeah, and all of the things that I said that I wanted
Come rushing by in my head when I'm with you
Fourteen joys and a will to be merry
All of the things that we say are very

[Chorus 3][x2]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3][x5]



[Verse 1]
Listen to the wind blow, watch the sun rise
Running in the shadows, damn your love, damn your lies

[Hook]
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain
(Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain
(Never break the chain)

[Verse 2]
Listen to the wind blow, down comes the night
Running in the shadows, damn your love, damn your lies
Break the silence, damn the dark, damn the light

[Hook]
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain
(Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain
(Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain
(Never break the chain)

[Guitar solo]

[Outro]
Chains keep us together (run into the shadows)
Chains keep us together (run into the shadows)
Chains keep us together (run into the shadows)
Chains keep us together (run into the shadows)
Chains keep us together (run into the shadows)



[Verse]
Why don't you ask him if he's going to stay?
Why don't you ask him if he's going away?
Why don't you tell me what's going on?
Why don't you tell me who's on the phone?
Why don't you ask him what's going wrong?
Why don't you ask him who's the latest on his throne?

[Bridge]
Don't say that you love me, hiyee-ha
Just tell me that you want me, hiyee-ha
Tusk!
Just say that you want me, hiyee-ha
Don't say that you

[Outro]
Tusk!
Real savage-like

Tusk!
Tusk!
Tusk! Tusk! Tusk!



[Verse 1]
Everybody's trying to say I'm wrong
I just want to be back where I belong

[Chorus 1]
World turning
I got to get my feet back on the ground
World turning
Everybody's got me down

[Chorus 2]
Maybe I'm wrong but who's to say what's right
I need somebody to help me through the night

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Outro]
Turning
Everybody's got me down
World turning
Everybody's got me down



[Verse 1]
Sweet wonderful you
You make me happy with the things you do
Oh, can it be so?
This feeling follows me wherever I go

[Chorus]
I never did believe in miracles
But I’ve a feeling it’s time to try
I never did believe in the ways of magic
But I’m beginning to wonder why

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Don’t, don’t break the spell
It would be different and you know it will
You, you make loving fun
And I don’t have to tell you but you’re the only one

[Outro][x4]
You, you make loving fun (It’s all I want to do)

Goin' to the city, got you on my mind
Country sure is pretty, I'll leave it all behind
This is my decision, I'm comin' home to stay this time

'Cause I'm a fool for the city, I'm a fool for the city
Fool for the city, I'm a fool for the city

Breathin' all the clean air, sittin' in the sun
When I get my train fare, I'll get up and run
I'm ready for the city, air pollution here I come!

'Cause I'm a fool for the city, I'm a fool for the city
I'm a fool for the city, I'm a fool for the city

I'm like a fish out of water
I'm just a man in a hole
The city lights turn my blues into gold
I ain't no country boy, I'm just a homesick man
I'm gonna hit the grit just as fast as I can

I'm tired of layin' back, hangin' around
I'm gonna catch that train, then I'll be city bound

I ain't no country boy, I'm just a homesick man
I'm gonna hit the grit just as fast as I can
I'll get off on Main Street, step into the crowd
Sidewalk under my feet, yeah, traffic's good and loud
When I see my inner city child, I'll be walkin' on a cloud

'Cause I'm a fool for the city, I'm a fool for the city
I'm a fool for the city, I'm a fool for the city
I'm a fool, (Fool for the city) A fool for the city, (Fool for the city)
I'm a fool, (Fool for the city) A fool for the city, (Fool for the city)

I don't want you, cook my bread
I don't want you, make my bed
I don't want your money, too
I just wanna make love to you

I don't want you, be no slave
I don't want you, work all day
I don't want you to be sad and blue
I just wanna make love to you

I can tell by the way that you baby talk
I can see by the way that you switch and walk
I can tell by the way that you treat your man
But I could love you, baby, it's a cryin' shame

I don't want you, wash my clothes
I don't want you, keep a home
I don't want you to be true

You know the rhythm is right
You know the rhythm is right
We've got to rock all night
We've got to rock all night

You know the rhythm is right
We've got to rock all night
You know the rhythm is right
We've got to rock all night
Woah, come all night

Woo, woo
Your flamin' heart
Your flamin' heart

Your flamin' heart
Your flamin' heart
Woo, woo, woo

Slow ride!



[Intro]
All my life I've been searching for something
Something never comes, never leads to nothing
Nothing satisfies but I'm getting close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope
All night long I dream of the day
When it comes around, then it's taken away
Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most
The feeling comes to life when I see your ghost

[Verse 1]
Come down don't you resist
You have such a delicate wrist
And if I give it a twist
Something to hold when I lose my grip
Will I find something in that
So give me just what I need
Another reason to bleed
One by one hidden up my sleeve
One by one hidden up my sleeve

[Chorus]
Hey don't let it go to waste
I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keep pinning me down
Hey don't let it go to waste
I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keep pinning me down

[Verse 2]
Will I find a believer
Another one who believes
Another one to deceive
Over and over down on my knees
If I get any closer
And if you open up wide
And if you let me inside
On and on I've got nothing to hide
On and on I've got nothing to hide

[Chorus]
Hey don't let it go to waste
I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keep pinning me down
Hey don't let it go to waste
I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keep pinning me down

[Bridge]
All my life I've been searching for something
Something never comes, never leads to nothing
Nothing satisfies but I'm getting close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope
All night long I dream of the day
When it comes around, then it's taken away
Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most
The feeling comes to life when I see your ghost
And I'm done, done and I'm on to the next one
And I'm done, done and I'm on to the next one
And I'm done, done and I'm on to the next one
And I'm done, done and I'm on to the next one
And I'm done, done and I'm on to the next one
And I'm done, done and I'm on to the next one
And I'm done, done and I'm on to the next one
And I'm done, done and I'm on to the next one

Done, done, on to the next one
Done I'm done and I'm on to the next one

[Chorus]
Hey don't let it go to waste
I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keep pinning me down
Hey don't let it go to waste
I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keeping me down

Done, done and on to the next one
Done, I'm done, and I'm
On to the next



[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Windin' your way down on Baker Street
Light in your head and dead on your feet
Well another crazy day, you'll drink the night away
And forget about everything
This city desert makes you feel so cold
It's got so many people but it's got no soul
And it's taking you so long to find out you were wrong
When you thought it held everything

You used to think that it was so easy
You used to say that it was so easy
But you're tryin', you're tryin' now
Another year and then you'll be happy
Just one more year and then you'll be happy
But you're cryin', you're cryin' now

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Way down the street there's a light in his place
He opens the door he's got that look on his face
And he asks you where you've been
You tell him who you've seen and you talk about anything
He's got this dream about buyin' some land
He's gonna give up the booze and the one night stands
And then he'll settle down, there's a quiet little town
And forget about everything

But you know he'll always keep movin'
You know he's never gonna stop movin'
Cus he's rollin', he's the rollin' stone
And when you wake up it's a new mornin'
The sun is shinin' it's a new mornin'
You're goin', you're goin' home

[Instrumental Outro]



[Verse 1]
I've got another confession to make
I'm your fool
Everyone's got their chains to break
Holdin' you
Were you born to resist or be abused?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Are you gone and on to someone new?
I needed somewhere to hang my head
Without your noose
You gave me something that I didn't have
But had no use
I was too weak to give in
Too strong to lose
My heart is under arrest again
But I break loose
My head is giving me life or death
But I can't choose
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse

[Chorus]
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
You trust, you must
Confess
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?

[Verse 2]
Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
The life, the love you'd die to heal
The hope that starts the broken hearts
You trust, you must
Confess

[Bridge]
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?

[Verse 2]
I've got another confession my friend
I'm no fool
I'm getting tired of starting again
Somewhere new
Were you born to resist or be abused?
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse

[Chorus]
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
You trust, you must
Confess
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?



[Verse 1]
Hello, I've waited here for you
Everlong
Tonight, I throw myself into
And out of the red
Out of her head, she sang
Come down, and waste away with me
Down with me
Slow how you wanted it to be
And over my head, out of her head she sang

[Pre-Chorus]
And I wonder when I sing along with you

[Chorus]
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
She sang

[Verse 2]
Breathe out, so I can breathe you in
Hold you in
And now I know you've always been
And out of your head, out of my head I sang

[Pre-Chorus]
And I wonder when I sing along with you

[Chorus]
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
She sang

[Instrumental Break with whispering voices]

[Bridge]
And I wonder...

[Chorus]
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when



[Verse 1]
Run and tell all of the angels
This could take all night
Think I need a devil to help me get things right
Hook me up a new revolution
Cause this one is a lie
We sat around laughing and watched the last one die

[Chorus]
Now I'm looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something to help me burn out bright
I'm looking for a complication
Looking cause I'm tired of lying
Make my way back home when I learn to fly high

[Verse 2]
I think I'm done nursing the patience
It can wait one night
I'd give it all away if you give me one last try
We'll live happily ever trapped if you just save my life
Run and tell the angels that everything's alright

[Chorus 2]
Now I'm looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something to help me burn out bright
I'm looking for a complication
Looking cause I'm tired of trying
Make my way back home when I learn to fly high
Make my way back home when I learn to...

[Bridge]
Fly along with me, I can't quite make it alone
Try to make this life my own
Fly along with me, I can't quite make it alone
Try to make this life my own

[Chorus 2]
I'm looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something to help me burn out bright
I'm looking for a complication
Looking cause I'm tired of trying
Make my way back home when I learn to

I'm looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something to help me burn out bright
I'm looking for a complication
Looking cause I'm tired of trying
Make my way back home when I learn to fly high
Make my way back home when I learn to fly...
Make my way back home when I learn to...



[Verse 1]
What have we done with innocence?
It disappeared with time, it never made much sense
Adolescent resident
Wasting another night on planning my revenge

[Pre-Chorus]
One in ten
One in ten
One in ten

[Chorus]
Don't want to be your monkey wrench
One more indecent accident
I'd rather leave than suffer this
I'll never be your monkey wrench

[Verse 2]
All this time to make amends
What do you do when all your enemies are friends?
Now and then I'll try to bend
Under pressure wind up snapping in the end

[Pre-Chorus]
One in ten
One in ten
One in ten

[Chorus]
Don't want to be your monkey wrench
One more indecent accident
I'd rather leave than suffer this
I'll never be your monkey wrench

Temper
Temper
Temper

[Bridge]
One last thing before I quit
I never wanted any more than I could fit
Into my head
I still remember every single word you said
And all the shit that somehow came along with it
Still there's one thing that comforts me
Since I was always caged and now I'm free

[Chorus]
Don't want to be your monkey wrench
One more indecent accident
I'd rather leave than suffer this
I'll never be your monkey wrench

[Outro]
Don't want to be your monkey wrench (fall in, fall out)
Don't want to be your monkey wrench (fall in, fall out)
Don't want to be your monkey wrench (fall in, fall out)
Don't want to be your monkey wrench



[Verse 1]
Too alarming now to talk about
Take your pictures down and shake it out
Truth or consequence, say it aloud
Use that evidence, race it around

[Chorus]
There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary

[Verse 2]
Don't the best of them bleed it out
While the rest of them peter out
Truth or consequence, say it aloud
Use that evidence, race it around

[Chorus]
There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary

[Bridge]
Kudos, my hero
Leaving all the best
You know my hero
The one that's on

[Chorus]
There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary
There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary



[Intro]
Keep you in the dark you know they all pretend
Keep you in the dark and so it all began

[Verse 1]
Send in your skeletons
Sing as their bones go marching in again
They need you buried deep
The secrets that you keep are at the ready
Are you ready
I'm finished making sense
Done pleading ignorance, that whole defense
Spinning infinity, boy
The wheel is spinning me
It's never ending
Never ending
Same old story

[Chorus]
What if I say I'm not like the others
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender
What if I say I'm not like the others
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender

[Verse 2]
In time or so I'm told
I'm just another soul for sale
Oh well
The page is out of print
We are not permanent, we're
Temporary, temporary
Same old story

[Chorus]
What if I say I'm not like the others
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender
What if I say I'm not like the others
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender

[Bridge]
I'm the voice inside your head
You refuse to hear
I'm the face that you have to face
Mirroring your stare
I'm what's left
I'm what's right
I'm the enemy
I'm the hand that took you down
Bring you to your knees
So who are you
Yeah, who are you
Yeah, who are you
Yeah, who are you

[Break-Down]
Keep you in the dark
You know they all pretend

[Chorus]
What if I say I'm not like the others
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender
What if I say I'm not like the others
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender

[Outro]
What if I say I'm not like the others?
(Keep you in the dark)
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
(You know they all)
You're the pretender
(Pretend)
What if I say I will never surrender?

What if I say I'm not like the others?
(Keep you in the dark)
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
(You know they all)
You're the pretender
(Pretend)
What if I say I will never surrender?

So who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?



One of these days the ground will drop out from beneath your feet
One of these days your heart will stop and play its final beat
One of these days the clocks will stop and time won't mean a thing
One of these days their bombs will drop and silence everything

But it's alright
Yeah, it's alright
I said it's alright

Easy for you to say
Your heart has never been broken
Your pride has never been stolen
Not yet not yet

One of these days
I bet your heart'll be broken
I bet your pride'll be stolen
I bet I bet I bet I bet
One of these days
One of these days

One of these days your eyes will close and pain will disappear
One of these days you will forget to hope and learn to fear

But it's alright
Yeah, it's alright
I said it's alright

Easy for you to say
Your heart has never been broken
Your pride has never been stolen
Not yet not yet

One of these days
I bet your heart'll be broken
I bet your pride'll be stolen
I bet I bet I bet I bet
One of these days
One of these days

But it's alright
Yeah, it's alright
I said it's alright
Yeah, it's alright
Don't say it's alright
Don't say it's alright
Don't say it's alright

One of these days your heart will stop and play its final beat
But it's alright

(Chorus)

One of these days
I bet your heart'll be broken
I bet your pride'll be stolen
I bet I bet I bet I bet

One of these days
One of these days
One of these days



[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I, I'm a one way motorway
I'm the one that drives away, follows you back home
I, I'm a street light shining
I'm a white light blinding bright, burning off and on, oh

[Chorus]
It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these time and time again

[Verse 2]
I, I'm a new day rising
I'm a brand new sky to hang the stars upon tonight
But I, I'm a little divided
Do I stay or run away and leave it all behind? Ah

[Chorus]
It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these time and time again

[Instrumental Break with vocalizations]

[Chorus]
It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these time and time again
It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these time and time again
It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these time and time again



[Verse 1]
Out in the street it's 6 am, another sleepless night
Three cups of coffee, but I can't clear my head from what went down last night
No, we won't have our own little ways, but somehow we keep it together
You hear me talk, but you don't hear what I say, I guess it don't even matter

[Chorus]
Blue morning, blue day, won't you see things my way?
Blue morning, can't you see what your love has done to me?

[Verse 2]
I've always listened to your point of view, my ways are cut through men
And I've always been a patient man, but my patience has reached its end
You tell me you're leaving, you tell me goodbye
You say you might send a letter
Well honey don't telephone, cause I won't be alone
I need someone to make me feel better

[Chorus] [x2]

[Outro]
Blue morning, blue morning [x3]
Blue, blue, blue day



[Verse 1]
You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice our love
You never take advice
Some day, you'll pay the price
I know

[Chorus]
I've seen it before, it happens all the time
You're closing the door, you leave the world behind
You're digging for gold, yet throwing away
A fortune in feelings but, some day, you'll pay

[Verse 2]
You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice our love
You want paradise
But some day, you'll pay the price
I know

[Chorus]
I've seen it before, it happens all the time
You're closing the door, you leave the world behind
You're digging for gold, yet throwing away
A fortune in feelings but, some day, you'll pay

[Bridge]
Cold as ice
You know that you are
Cold as ice
As cold as ice to me
Cold as ice

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, cold as, cold as ice
You're as cold as ice
You're as cold as ice, cold as ice, I know
You're as cold as ice, yes I know
You're as cold as ice, cold as ice, I know
You're as cold as ice, oh, yes I know
You're as cold as ice, cold as ice, I know
You're as cold as ice, oh, yes I know
You're as cold as ice, cold as ice



[Verse 1]
Hey, baby, if you're feeling down
I know what's good for you all day
Are you worried what your friends see
Will it ruin your reputation loving me

[Chorus]
Because I'm a dirty white boy
Yeah a dirty white boy
A dirty white boy

[Verse 2]
Don't drive no big black car
Don't like no Hollywood movie star
You want me to be true to you
You don't give a damn what I do to you

[Chorus][x2]
I'm just a dirty white boy
Dirty white boy, dirty white boy
Dirty white boy, dirty white boy
Dirty white boy

[Verse 3]
I've been in trouble since I don't know when
I'm in trouble now and I now somehow I'll find trouble again
I'm a loner, but I'm never alone
Every night I get one step closer to the danger zone

[Chorus][x3]
Because I'm a dirty white boy
Dirty white boy, yeah, dirty white boy
Dirty white boy, I'm a dirty white boy
Dirty white boy



[Verse 1]
Feeling down 'n' dirty, feeling kinda mean
I've been from one to another extreme
This time I had a good time, ain't got time to wait
I wanna stick around 'till I can't see straight

[Chorus]
Fill my eyes with that double vision
No disguise for that double vision
Ooh, when it gets through to me, it's always new to me
My double vision gets the best of me

[Verse 2]
Never do more than I, I really need
My mind is racing, but my body's in the lead
Tonight's the night, I'm gonna push it to the limit
I live all of my years in a single minute

[Chorus]
Fill my eyes with that double vision
No disguise for that double vision
Ooh, when it gets through to me, it's always new to me
My double vision always seems to get the best of me, the best of me, yeah-eah eah-eah-hey

[Outro]
Oh-ooh (oh) oh-oh, double vision
(Oh) I need double vision
(Oh, double vision) it takes me out of my head, taking me out of my head
(Oh, double vision) I get my double vision, woa-oah
(Oh, double vision) seeing double double, double vision
(Oh, double vision) oh-oh my my double vision
(Oh, double vision) double vision, yeah-ah-ah eah-eah eah-eah ah
(Oh, double vision) I get double vision, oooh
How, how?



{Intro}
I would climb any mountain
Sail across a stormy sea
If that's what it takes me, baby
To show you how much you mean to me
And I guess it's just the woman in you
That brings out the man in me
I know I can't help myself
You're all in the world to me

It feels like the first time
Feels like the very first time
It Feels like the first time
It Feels like the very first time

I have waited a lifetime
Spent my time so foolishly
But now that I've found you
Together we'll make history
And I know that it must be the woman in you
That brings out the man in me
I know I can't help myself
You're all that my eyes can see

{Bridge}
And it feels like the first time
Like it never did before
Feels like the first time
Like we've opened up the door
Feels like the first time
Like it never will again
Never again
Feels like the first time (Feels like the first time )
And it feels like the very first time
And it feels like the first time (Oh! Feels like the first time )
It feels like the very first time

{Bridge}
Open up the door
Won't you open up the door? Yeah
Feels like the first time
And it feels like the very first time
And it feels like the first time
It feels like the very first time
Feels like the first time
And it feels like the very first time
And it feels like the first time
It feels like the very first time

{outro}



[Verse 1]
Daylight, alright
I don't know, I don't know if it's real
Been a long night and something isn't right
You won't show, you won't show how you feel
No time ever seems right
To talk about the reasons why you and I fight
It's high time to draw the line
Put an end to this game before it's too late

[Chorus]
Head games, it's you and me baby
Head games, and I can't take it anymore
Head games, I don't want to play the
Head games

[Verse 2]
I daydream for hours it seems
I keep thinking of you, yeah, thinking of you
These daydreams, what do they mean?
They keep haunting me, are they warning me?

Daylight turns into night
We try and find the answer but it's nowhere in sight
It's always the same and you know who's to blame
You know what I'm saying, still we keep on playing

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
So near, so far away
We pass each other by because we don't know what to say
It's so clear, I'm sorry to say
But if you want to win you got to learn how to play

[Chorus][x2]
Head games, always you and me, baby
Head games, until I can't take it anymore
Head games, instead of making love
Head games, ooh

[Outro]
Head games, in the first degree
Head games, yeah, always you and me
Head games, why do you do it baby?
Head games



[Chorus]
Well, I'm hot blooded, check it and see
I got a fever of a hundred and three
Come on baby, do you do more than dance?
I'm hot blooded, I'm hot blooded

[Verse 1]
You don't have to read my mind, to know what I have in mind
Honey you ought to know
Now you move so fine, let me lay it on the line
I want to know what you're doing after the show
Now it's up to you, we can make a secret rendezvous
Just me and you, I'll show you loving like you never knew

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
If it feels alright, maybe you can stay all night
Shall I leave you my key?
But you've got to give me a sign, come on girl, some kind of sign
Tell me, are you hot mama? you sure look that way to me
Are you old enough? will you be ready when I call you bluff?
Is my timing right? did you save your love for me tonight?

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Now it's up to you, can we make a secret rendezvous?
Oh, before we do, you'll have to get away from you know who

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Hot blooded, every night
Hot blooded, you're looking so tight
Hot blooded, now you're driving me wild
Hot blooded, I'm so hot for you, child
Hot blooded, I'm a little bit high
Hot blooded, you're a little bit shy
Hot blooded, you're making me sing
Hot blooded, for your sweet sweet thing



[Verse 1]
I got to take a little time
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm older
Now this mountain I must climb
Feels like a world upon my shoulders
I through the clouds I see love shine
It keeps me warm as life grows colder

[Pre-Chorus]
In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

[Chorus]
I want to know what love is
I want you to show me
I want to feel what love is
I know you can show me

[Verse 2]
I'm going to take a little time
A little time to look around me
I've got nowhere left to hide
It looks like love has finally found me

[Pre-Chorus]
In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life


[Chorus]
I want to know what love is
I want you to show me
I want to feel what love is
I know you can show me

[Bridge]
I want to know what love is
I want you to show me
And I want to feel, I want to feel what love is
And I know, I know you can show me

[Verse 3]
Let's talk about love
I want to know what love is, the love that you feel inside
I want you to show me, and I'm feeling so much love
I want to feel what love is, no, you just cannot hide
I know you can show me, yeah

[Outro]
I want to know what love is, let's talk about love
I know you can show me, I want to feel
I want to feel what love is, no, you just cannot hide
I know you can show me, yeah
I want to know what love is
I want you to show me
I want to feel what love is
I know you can show me



[Verse 1]
Standing in the rain, with his head hung low
Couldn't get a ticket, it was a sold out show
Heard the roar of the crowd, he could picture the scene
Put his ear to the wall, then like a distant scream
He heard one guitar, just blew him away
He saw stars in his eyes, and the very next day
Bought a beat up six string in a secondhand store
Didn't know how to play it, but he knew for sure
That one guitar felt good in his hands
Didn't take long to understand
Just one guitar, slung way down low
Was one way ticket, only one way to go

[Chorus]
So he started rocking
He is never going to stop
Got to keep on rocking
Someday he's going to make it to the top

And be a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes
He's a juke box hero
He took one guitar, juke box hero, stars in his eyes
Juke box hero, he'll come alive tonight

[Verse 2]
In a town without a name, in a heavy downpour
Thought he passed his own shadow, by the backstage door
Like a trip through the past, to that day in the rain
And that one guitar made his whole life change

[Chorus]
Now he needs to keep on rockin'
He just can't stop
Gotta keep on rocking'
Someday gonna make it to the top

And be a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes
He's a juke box hero
And be a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes
He took one guitar, stars in his eyes
He'll come alive tonight woah

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Yeah, he's gotta keep on rockin'
Never gonna stop
Gotta keep on rocking'
Someday gonna make it to the top
And be a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes
He's a juke box hero
Yeah juke box hero, got stars in his eyes
Juke box hero, ahh
Juke box hero, ahh
Juke box hero, got stars in his eyes
Stars in his eyes



[Verse 1]
It was a Monday
A day like any other day
I left a small town
For the Apple in decay

It was my destiny
It's what we needed to do
They were telling me
I'm telling you

[Chorus 1]
I was inside looking outside
The millions of faces
But still I'm alone
Waiting, hours of waiting
Paying a penance
I was longing for home

[Chorus 2]
I'm looking out for the two of us
I hope we'll be here when they're through with us

[Chorus 1]
I was inside looking outside
Oh the millions of faces
But still I'm alone
Waiting, hours of waiting
I could feel the tension
I was longing for home

[Chorus 2]
I'm looking out for the two of us
And I hope we'll be here when they're through with us
I'm a long way home

[Chorus 3]
Monday, sad, sad Monday
She's waiting for me
But I'm a long, long way from home
Sad, sad Monday
She's waiting for me
But I'm a long, long way from home
Sad, sad Monday
She's waiting for me
But I'm a long, long way from home



[Verse 1]
Some girls you meet seem so complete
Like they don't need nothing from you
They're out to show you they don't want to know you
When deep inside they do
Well, this girl didn't want me or anyone else
She was alone, thought I'd give it a try
I was a young bull stomping in the field
I saw red when she walked by

[Chorus]
Love has taken its toll, love has
Love has taken, taken its toll, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
I had to think fast, I watched her walk past
I knew I would have my way
So I swaggered up, I mean I staggered up
But I didn't have a damn thing to say
Now, two handed strategy always works well for me
So I slipped my hands around her waist
I swore it was the right move, feeling so smooth
Till she backhanded me across my face

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
To make a long story short, she finally got caught
I had to tell her enough is enough
She said, "You're just what I needed", and boy
She nearly pleaded with me not to be too rough

[Chorus][x3]



[Verse 1]
I stole a ride on a passing star
Not knowing where I was going
How near or how far
Through years of light, lands of future and past
Until the heavenly gates
Were sighted at last

[Chorus 1]
Starrider, rider, rider
Take me to the stars
Starrider, rider, rider
Show me where you are

[Verse 2]
Northern lights flashed by
And then they were gone
And as old stars would die
So the new ones were born
And ever on I sailed
Celestial ways
And in the light of my years
Shone the rest of my days

[Chorus 2]
Speed increasing
All control is in the hands of those who know
Will they help us grow
To one day be starriders

[Chorus 1]
Starrider, rider, rider
Show me where you are
Starrider, rider, rider
Take me to the stars

[Chorus 2]



[Verse 1]
I thought I knew you well
But all this time I could never tell
I let you get away
Haunts me every night and every day
You were the only one
The only friend that I counted on
How could I watch you walk away
I'd give anything to have you here today
But now I stand alone with my pride
And dream that you're still by my side

[Chorus]
But that was yesterday
I had the world in my hands
But it's not the end of my world
Just a slight change of plans

[Bridge]
That was yesterday
But today life goes on
No more hiding in yesterday
Because yesterday's gone

[Verse 2]
Love, my love I gave it all
Thought I saw the light
When I heard you call
Life that we both could share
Has deserted me
Left me in despair
But now I stand alone with my pride
Fighting back the tears I never let myself cry

[Chorus]
But that was yesterday
Love was torn from my hands
But it's not the end of my world
Just a little hard to understand

[Verse 3]
That was yesterday
But today life goes on
You won't find me in yesterday's world
Now yesterday's gone

[Outro]
Goodbye yesterday
Now it's over and done
Still I hope somewhere deep in your heart
Yesterday will live on



[Verse 1]
You're not shy, you get around
You want to fly, don't want your feet on the ground
You stay up, you won't come down
You want to live, you want to move to the sound

[Verse 2]
Got fire in your veins
Burning hot but you don't feel the pain
Your desire is insane
You can't stop until you do it again

[Verse 3]
But sometimes I wonder as I look in your eyes
Maybe you're thinking of some other guy
But I know, yes I know, how to treat you right
That's why you call me in the middle of the night

[Verse 4]
You say it's urgent
So urgent, so oh oh urgent
Just wait and see
How urgent my love can be
It's urgent

[Verse 5]
You play tricks on my mind
You're everywhere but you're so hard to find
You're not warm or sentimental
You're so extreme, you can be so temperamental

[Verse 6]
But I'm not looking for a love that will last
I know what I need and I need it fast
Yeah, there's one thing in common that we both share
That's a need for for each other anytime, anywhere

[Verse 7]
It gets so urgent
So urgent
You know it's urgent
I want to tell you it's the same for me
So urgent
Just you wait and see
How urgent our love can be
It's urgent

[Verse 8]
You say it's urgent
Make it fast, make it urgent
Do it quick, do it urgent
Got to rush, make it urgent
Want it quick
Urgent, urgent, emergency

[Outro]
So urgent, emergency
Emer... emer... emer...
It's urgent



[Verse 1]
So long, i've been looking too hard, I've waiting too long
Sometimes I don't know what I will find
I only know it's a matter of time
When you love someone
When you love someone
It feels so right, so warm and true
I need to know if you feel it too
Maybe I'm wrong
Won't you tell me if I'm coming on too strong?
This heart of mine has been hurt before
This time I want to be sure

[Chorus]
I've been waiting for a girl like you
To come into my life
I've been waiting for a girl like you
A love that will survive
I've been waiting for someone new
To make me feel alive
Yeah, waiting for a girl like you
To come into my life

[Verse 2]
You're so good
When we make love it's understood
It's more than a touch or a word we say
Only in dreams could it be this way
When you love someone
Yeah, really love someone
Now, I know it's right
From the moment I wake up till deep in the night
There's no where on earth that I'd rather be
Than holding you, tenderly

[Chorus]
I've been waiting for a girl like you
To come into my life
I've been waiting for a girl like you
A love that will survive
I've been waiting for someone new
To make me feel alive
Yeah, waiting for a girl like you
To come into my life
I've been waiting for a girl like you
To come into my life
I've been waiting for a girl like you
A love that will survive
I've been waiting for someone new
To make me feel alive
Yeah, waiting for a girl like you
To come into my life

[Outro]
Won't you come into my life?
My life?



[Verse 1]
Women behind bars
Women in fast cars
Women in distress
Women with no dress
Women in aeroplanes
Women who play games
Women in uniform
See that woman with her clothes torn

[Verse 2]
Women who satisfy
Women you can't buy
Like women in magazines
And women in a limousine
Women who sip champagne
Women who feel no pain
Women in a disco
And women who don't wanna know, know, know

[Verse 3]
Oh women wanting sympathy
Women feeling ecstasy
Women who live in fantasies
Bringing man to his knees

[Verse 4]
Women who fall in love
Women who need a shove
Women who can't be beat
Get that woman in the back seat, yeah, yeah
Women in the U.S.A
Those women steal your heart away
Women into rock and roll
Women who steal the show, go, go, go

[Verse 5]
Women that you write songs about
Women that turn around and kick you out
Women you dream about all your life
Women that stab you in the back with a switchblade knife

[Verse 6]
Oh women, ooh, ooh
Talk about women
Around the world
Yeah women
Oh no, it goes
Talking about women
Come on baby



[Liner Note 1]
A boring old garage in a residential area with a teen-age band rehearsing in it. JOE (the main character in the CENTRAL SCRUTINIZER'S Special Presentation) sings to us of the trials and tribulations of garage-band husbandry...

[Intro: Central Scrutinizer & Joe]
We take you now, to a garage, in Canoga Park...
(It makes its own sauce...)

[Verse 1: Joe]
It wasn't very large
There was just enough room to cram the drums
In the corner over by the Dodge
It was a fifty-four
With a mashed up door
And a cheesy little amp
With a sign on the front said "Fender Champ"
And a second hand guitar
It was a Stratocaster with a whammy bar

[Liner Note 2]
At this point, LARRY (a guy who will eventually give up music and earn a respectable living as a roadie for a group called Toad-O) joins in the song...

[Chorus: Larry]
We could jam in Joe's Garage
His mama was screamin'
His dad was mad
We was playin' the same old song
In the afternoon 'n' sometimes we would
Play it all night long
It was all we knew, 'n' easy too
So we wouldn't get it wrong
All we did was bend the string like...

[Verse 2: Larry]
Hey!
Down in Joe's Garage
We didn't have no dope or LSD
But a coupla quarts'a beer
Would fix it so the intonation
Would not offend your ear
And the same old chords goin' over 'n' over
Became a symphony
We would play it again 'n' again 'n' again
Cause it sounded good to me
One more time!

[Chorus: Larry]
We could jam in Joe's Garage
His mama was screaming
"Turn it down!"
We was playing' the same old song
In the afternoon 'n' sometimes we would
Play it all night long
It was all we knew, and easy too
So we wouldn't get it wrong
Even if you played it on the saxophone

[Verse 3: Larry & Liner Note 3]
We thought we was pretty good
We talked about keepin' the band together
'N' we figured that we should
Cause about this time we was gettin' the eye
From the girls in the neighborhood
They'd all come over 'n' dance around
Like...
(Twenty teen-age girls dash
In and go STOMP-CLAP
STOMP-CLAP-CLAP...)
So we picked out a stupid name
Had some cards printed up for a couple 'a bucks
'N' we was on our way to fame
Got matching suits 'N' Beatle Boots
'N' a sign on the back of the car
'N' we was ready to work in a Go-Go bar

[Bridge]
One, two, three, four
Let's see if you got some more!

[Verse 4: Larry & Joe]
People seemed to like our song
They got up 'n' danced 'n' made a lotta noise
An' it wasn't 'fore very long
A guy from a company we can't name
Said we ought'a take his pen
'N' sign on the line for a real good time
But he didn't tell us when
These "good times" would be somethin'
That was really happenin'
So the band broke up
An' it looks like
We will never play again
Guess you only get one chance in life
To play a song that goes like...

[Liner Note 4]
*And, as the band plays their little song
MRS. BORG (who keeps her son SY
In the closet with the vacuum cleaner)
Screams out the window...*

[Bridge: Mrs. Borg]
Turn it down!
Turn it DOWN!
I have children sleeping here...
Don't you boys know any nice songs?

[Verse 5: Joe]
Well the years was rollin' by, yeah
Heavy Metal 'n' Glitter Rock
Had caught the public eye, yeah
Snotty boys with lipstick on
Was really flyin' high, yeah
'N' then they got that Disco thing
'N' New Wave came along
'N' all of a sudden I thought the time
Had come for that old song
We used to play in "Joe's Garage"
And if I am not wrong
You will soon be dancin' to the-

[Bridge: Central Scrutinizer]
The White Zone is for loading and unloading only
If you gotta load or unload, go to the White Zone

[Outro: Joe, Mrs. Borg & Officer Butzis]
Well the years was rollin' by
The years were rollin' by (I'm calling the police!)
The years were rollin' by
The years were rollin' by (I did it! They'll be here, shortly!)
The years were rollin' by (This is the police...)
(I'm not joking around anymore!)
The years was rollin' by (We have the garage surrounded)
(Give yourself up)
(We will not harm you, or hurt you neither)
The years were rollin' by
You'll see them, there they are, they're coming!)
(This is the police)
The years were rollin' by
(Give yourself up)
(We will not harm you)
(Listen to that mess, would you?)
(This is the police, give yourself up)
(We have the garage surrounded!)
(Everyday this goes on around here!)
The years were rollin' by
(We will not harm you, or maim you)
The years were rollin' by
(SWAT Team 4, move in!)
(He used to cut my grass! He was a very nice boy!)
(This is the police, come out with your hands up!)
(That's disgusting...)

[Outro: Central Scrutinizer]
This is the Central Scrutinizer...
That was Joe's first confrontation with "The Law"...
Naturally, we were easy on him
One of our friendly counsellors gave him a donut
And told him to stick closer
To church-oriented social activities...



[Instrumental]



Oh, whoa, whoa
Ow
Mm!

There she stood in the street
Smiling from her head to her feet
I said-ah, hey, what is this?
Now baby, maybe, maybe she's in need of a kiss

I said-ah, "Hey, what's your name baby?
Maybe we can see things the same
Now don't you wait or hesitate
Let's move before they raise the parking rate."
Ow!

All right now
Baby, it's-ah all right now
Mm!
All right now
Baby, it's-ah all right now
Whoa, ooh

Let me tell you now
Mm!

I took her home to my place
Watching every move on her face
She said, "Look, what's your game, baby?
Are you tryin' to put me in shame?"

I said, "Slow, don't go so fast
Don't you think that love can last?"
She said, "Love, Lord above
Huh, now you're trying to trick me in love"
Ow!

All right now
Baby, it's-ah all right now
All right now
Baby, it's-ah all right now

Yeah, it's all right now
Yeah!

Hoo!
Oh yeah, ow!
Let me tell you all about it, now
Ow!
Yeah

Took her home, yeah, to my place
Watching every move on her face
She said, "Look, uh, what's your game?
Are you trying to put me in shame?"

"Baby," I said, "Slow, slow, don't go so fast, huh
Don't you think that love can last?"
She said, "Love, Lord above
Now he's trying to trick me in love"
Yeah!

All right now
Baby, it's-ah all right now, yeah
All right now
Baby, it's-ah all right now

All right now
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right
All right now
All right now
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right



(Yea, yea yea, yo. Red Mercury. Vril. Waddup Larro)

Can't fill these empty holes, Sank clouds on the steady low
And undertows dragged down by our heavy souls
?? we hold chasing our fantasies
Insanity pursued just to feud the noose for humanity
Families removed, and our attitude is vanity
Profanities abused, and I'm starting to lose the man in me
Choose calamity thinking our solution is anarchy
Standardly the motto, we swallow to follow frantically
Sick old fan it ? semantics of anthropology
Technology we advance for the dance with the devil's solemnly
Colonies futuristic the mechanistic simplistic
For the narcissistic rants of the hypnotic entrenched dipshits
Equipped with a quick fact but you couldn't ? pack ??
A mystic perhaps, but the gaps in your synapse missed it
Persistent collapse can't stay in my house on the thin earth
So more sand in my mouth I'm about to spit a desert
I ? from bombs, I wouldn't die to preserve
It's absurd at how we try just to deny what we were
Stirring the sediment of regret deep in the marrow
The bottom's an apex when you're underneath the barrel
No wonder why Larro made melodies out of his misery
Physically carved a sorrow for tomorrows we won't live to see
It lives in me all the things I would give to be
Free from the burdens and the perversions that imprison me
I feel invisibly shrouded
I am routed by an over path parade from the ways that I vowed it
I am the rains that were cloudy
Crowded by an overcast dismay from the days that I doubt it
I gave away though was valid
My palette thrown in trash with its ray, you might say I allowed it
I spend my days thinking how it, coward to a lower class when I slay the empowered
I am the rain when it showers
Flowered the disdain in my brain from the pain that it flowered
I ain't the same since the hour
The tower of your frame left his plain engraved in your name, rest in power
This is the change in the season
Its the reason I explain internal shames to make the change I believe in
These are the stains I was bleeding
These are demons feeding on pain that I've gained, I'm ashamed cuz I need em
This is the path that I'm leading
This is leaving before my wrath turns to ash all I craft you in dreaming
This is the epitaph's hopeless
This is the closest I have got to the bottom, this is stopping to smell the roses
The process of focus
This is gnosis that rains from my heart strings thinking on things I hold closest
This is my soul in a solstice
This is holding my kids close to my chest before my day of death approaches
This is the way of osmosis from atrocious sins of flesh that I rep when I kept being bogus
This is my notice to you, I am sorry for who I been realizing that its been long overdue
Telling you lies like they're true
I abused both your eyes made em cry as you denied what you knew
This is me telling the truth
This is a closet full of skeletons shook by the elephants shoe

So this is reflections of all I hailed and then paint it black
This is recollections of betrayals I can't take em back
This is the deceptions I detailed in every paining fact
This is resurrections of how I fail trying make it back
These are these apologies my stubbornness would never speak
This is filth uncovered with it ? when it severed deep
This is the disgustingness I lusted but it never sleeps
This is who you trusted in another, it isn't me

Self sabotage felt shelled in a stealth camouflage
For size that I melt when ? felt in a cattle prod
I ride myself for the wealth and then haggle God
Paddle flogged myself making shrapnel out of ?
Don't ?? for bitten fruit
That slid into a fit ?? prize ribbon of a hidden truth
I'm living proof of every decision that I've bitten through
And didn't chew new position of my wisdom tooth
We misconstrue and wish we knew
While arguing with different views and threw it away and say it isn't true
I'm splitting two dynamics of polar opposites
Dichotomous mechanics my antics are covert operatives
I am provocative ain't trying to live with ostriches
A hostage is a fear I am no where near cooperative
I'm not an optimist, I'm waiting for apocalypse
Where the rich lift off in shiny coffins called a rocket ship
I am the pot to piss in holding ones within
Wishing for counter tops of another spot in the kitchen
Coals a missing piece won't fit in the puzzle picture
Snake bite ? every trouble when it bit ya
I am the witch of matrix glitch of the perception
Shifting the grifter's deception sharing this life reflection wit ya
The same depict I'm deranged of obtaining the mixture of pain and blood stains
Spraying from my veins when it paint the picture
I am insane and sick of bitter mouth with thunder speech
A bullshitter, so dig me out from when I'm underneath
My son's bequeath with a rage of my distraught and pride
Tied to the trait, manipulations in my daughter's cries
I swore to rise for my life and master ?
I love my wife and never want to be a bastard father
My path is harder from all the wrath I harbor
I grab at my mask when my tendencies ask my bother
I play the martyr in my smarter than my villain's side
Deny the deceptions see my reflections in my children's eyes
Am I still inside or have I taken up a vacancy
Of what latency brings and I'm finally a king of make belief
I have a great belief they feasting on complacency
And patiently wait in every place that it was taking me
The human bakery full of my pains pastery
A tasty buffet, I feel like demons are based in me
It lays waste to me I fell from grace hastily
I'm trying to keep faith that heaven will have a place for me
So wait for me I shouldn't have broke the oath I spoke to you
I hope that you forgive me from the litanies we spoken through
I know you hear me and I want to state it clearly
I'm sorry I cheated and proceeded to let it steer me
I know you're weary of what you dug through to clear me
I thank God you're still near me, cuz I love you sincerely

(x6)
I'm trying to find my way again
So I can speak truth and what I say to them
I'm just trying to find my way again

I'm just trying to find my way again
Trying to find my way again
Trying to find my way again



VERSE 1
Take off your hat, kick off your shoes
I know you ain't going anywhere
Run round the town singing your blues
I know you ain't going anywhere

CHORUS 1
You've always been a good friend of mine
But you're always saying farewell
And the only time that you're satisfied
Is with your feet in the wishing well

VERSE 2
Throw down your gun, you might shoot yourself
Or is that what you're trying to do?
Put up a fight you believe to be right
And someday the sun will shine through

CHORUS 2
You've always got something to hide
Something you just can't tell
And the only time that you're satisfied
Is with your feet in the wishing well

MIDDLE EIGHT
And I know what you're wishing for
Love and a peaceful world
Love and a peaceful world
Love and a peaceful world
Love and a peaceful world

CHORUS 1

I wish you well
The wishing well
Everybody has a wish
Everybody has a dream
I wish you well
You have to dream your own dream



[George Clinton]
Mother Earth is pregnant for the third time
For y'all have knocked her up
I have tasted the maggots in the mind of the universe
I was not offended
For I knew I had to rise above it all
Or drown in my own shit

[Eddie Hazel's guitar solo]

[George Clinton during the solo]
Come on Maggot Brain
Go on Maggot Brain



Here in my car
I feel safest of all
I can lock all my doors
It's the only way to live
In cars

Here in my car
I can only receive
I can listen to you
It keeps me stable for days
In cars

Here in my car
Where the image breaks down
Will you visit me please?
If I open my door
In cars

Here in my car
I know I've started to think
About leaving tonight
Although nothing seems right
In cars



I have just closed my eyes again
Climbed aboard the Dream Weaver train
Driver take away my worries of today
And leave tomorrow behind

Dream Weaver, I believe you can get me through the night
Dream Weaver, I believe we can reach the morning light

Fly me high through the starry skies
Or maybe to an astral plane
Cross the highways of fantasy
Help me to forget today's pain

Dream Weaver, I believe you can get me through the night
Dream Weaver, I believe we can reach the morning light

Though the dawn may be coming soon
There still may be some time
Fly me away to the bright side of the moon
And meet me on the other side

Dream Weaver, I believe you can get me through the night
Dream Weaver, I believe we can reach the morning light



Well, I think it's time to get ready
To realize just what I have found
I have lived only half of what I am
It's all clear to me now

My heart is on fire
My soul's like a wheel that's turnin'
My love is alive
My love is alive, yeah, girl, yeah

There's something inside that's making me crazy
I'll try to keep it together
'Cause what I say may not happen the same way
Now could be forever

My heart is on fire
My soul's like a wheel that's turnin'
My love is alive
My love is alive, yeah, girl, yeah

My love is alive
Woo hoo, my love is alive

There's a mirror moving inside my mind
Reflecting the love that you shine on me
Hold on now to that feeling
Let it flow, let it grow, yeah, yeah

My heart is on fire
My soul's like a wheel that's turnin'
My love is alive
My love is alive, yeah, girl, yeah

My love is alive
Woo hoo, my love is alive
Woo hoo, my love is alive
My love is alive
Woo hoo, my love is alive
Woo hoo, my love is alive
Woo hoo, my love is alive
Woo hoo



Bored of the life in the city of gold
He'd left and let nobody know
Gone were the towers he had known from a child
Along with a dream of a life

He traveled the wide open road
The blinkered arcade
In search of another to share in his life, nowhere
Everyone looked so strange to him

They got no horns and they got no tail
They don't even know of our existence
Am I wrong to believe in the city of gold
That lies in the deep distance?

He cried and wept as they led him away to a cage
Beast that can talk, read the sign
The creatures, they pushed and they prodded his frame
And questioned his story again

But soon they grew bored of their prey
The beast that can talk?
More like a freak or publicity stunt, oh oh, no no

They got no horns and they got no tail
They don't even know of our existence
Am I wrong to believe in the city of gold
That lies in the deep distance?

He cried and broke down the door
Of the cage and marched on out
He grabbed a creature by the scruff of his neck, pointing out

There, beyond the bounds of your weak imagination
Lie the noble towers of my city, bright and gold
Let me take you there, show you a living story
Let me show you others such as me, why did I ever leave?

"They got no horns and they got no tail
They don't even know of our existence
Am I wrong to believe in the city of gold
That lies in the deep distance?" he cried and wept

And so we set out with the beast and his horns
And his crazy description of home
After many days journey, we came to a peak
Where the beast gazed abroad and cried out

We followed his gaze and we thought that maybe we saw
A spire of gold, no, a trick of the eye, that's all
But the beast was gone and a voice was heard

They got no horns and they got no tail
They don't even know of our existence
Am I wrong to believe in the city of gold
That lies in the deep distance?
(Hello friend, welcome home)



Look up on the wall, there on the floor
Under the pillow, behind the door
There's a crack in the mirror
Somewhere there's a hole in a window pane
Do you think I'm to blame?
Tell me, do you think I'm to blame?

[Chorus]
(When we do it) you're never there
(When you show it) just stop and stare
(Abacab) he's in anywhere
(Abacab)

If you're wrappin' up the world
Cause you've taken someone else's girl
When they turn on the pillow
Even when they answer the telephone
Don't you think that by now...
Tell me, don't you think that by now

[Chorus]
(When we do it) you're never there
(When you show it) just stop and stare
(Abacab) he's in anywhere
(Abacab) doesn't really care

Do you want it? You got it. Now you know
Do you want it? You got it. Now you know

It's an illusion. It's a game
Or reflection of somewone else's name
When you wake in the morning
Wake and find you're covered in cellophane
Well, there's a hole in there somewhere
Yeah, there's a hole in there somewhere
Baby, there's a hole in there somewhere
Now there's a hole in there somewhere

[Chorus]
(When we do it) you're never there
(When you show it) you stop and stare
(Abacab) he's in anywhere
(Abacab)



I held the book so tightly in my hands, saw your picture, heard you call my name
There was something strange, I could not look away
I wanted to be there, I wanted to go

You gave me no warning
You gave no reason
But I was with you
Right by your side
Give me the strength, and I will help you
They can try their hardest, they don't frighten me

It is written in the book

It is hotter than I've known before, but I feel so cold, and I don't know why
But if the fire within your heart can beat the storm
Then I really believe, you could make it right

The time has come now
We must show our feelings
But I'm looking right through you
And your heart is empty

Whatever happened to you it's too late to change now
There's nowhere you can run to, no place to hide
Oh you let me down!

...but wait a minute, I don't understand
It's getting stronger, grab my hand
Don't wanna leave you, don't wanna go
But I'm losing all control
Can't you see me slipping away?
I can only stay if you've the will to keep me here

It is written in the book

Oh so many times since I've read those words
Just waiting to see you, can you see me?



There is lambswool under my naked feet
The wool is soft and warm
Gives off some kind of heat
A salamander scurries into flame to be destroyed
Imaginary creatures are trapped in birth on celluloid
The fleas cling to the golden fleece
Hoping they'll find peace
Each thought and gesture are caught in celluloid
There's no hiding in my memory
There's no room to avoid

The crawlers cover the floor in the red ochre corridor
For my second sight of people, they've more lifeblood than before
They're moving in time to a heavy wooden door
Where the needles eye is winking, closing in on the poor
The carpet crawlers heed their callers:
We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out

There's only one direction in the faces that I see;
It's upward to the ceiling, where the chambers said to be
Like the forest fight for sunlight, that takes root in every tree
They are pulled up by the magnet, believing they're free
The carpet crawlers heed their callers:
We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out

Mild mannered supermen are held in kryptonite
And the wise and foolish virgins giggle with their bodies glowing bright
Through a door a harvest feast is lit by candlelight;
It's the bottom of a staircase that spirals out of sight
The carpet crawlers heed their callers:
We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out

The porcelain mannequin with shattered skin fears attack
The eager pack lift up their pitchers, they carry all they lack
The liquid has congealed, which has seeped out through the crack
And the tickler takes his stickleback
The carpet crawlers heed their callers:
We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out



Stay with me
My love I hope you'll always be
Right here by my side if ever I needed you
Oh my love

In your arms
I feel so safe and so secure
Everyday is such a perfect day to spend
Alone with you

I will follow you will you follow me
All the days and nights that we know will be
I will stay with you will you stay with me
Just one single tear in each passing year

With the dark
I see so very clearly now
All my fears are drifting by me so slowly now
Fading away

I can say
The night is long but you are there
Close at hand I'm better for the smile you give
And while I live

I will follow you will you follow me
All the days and nights that we know will be
I will stay with you will you stay with me
Just one single tear in each passing year there will be

I will follow you (etc)



Images of sorrow, pictures of delight
Things that go to make up a life
Endless days of summer, longer nights of gloom
Just waiting for the morning light
Scenes of unimportance like photos in a frame
Things that go to make up a life

As we relive our lives in what we tell you



No use saying that it's alright, it's alright
Where were you after midnight, midnight?
Heard a bang, bang, bang, and down they go
It's just a job you do
'Cause the harder they run, the harder they fall
I'm coming down hard on you

No one saw what you looked like, what you looked like
Like a stranger you came out of the night, out of the night
'Cause someone put the word on you, I hope my aim is true

I got a name, I got a number, I gotta line on you
I got a name, and I got a number, I'm coming after you

Now, don't keep saying that it's alright, it's alright
It seems you went just a little too far this time
Heard a bang, bang, bang, and down you go
It's just a job I do
'Cause the harder you run and the harder you fall
I'm coming down hard on you, hard on you
I hope my aim is true

I got a name, I got a number, I got a line on you
I got a name, and I got a number, and I'm coming after you

Keep running, keep running
City to city, even if you're innocent
You can cause too much embarrassment
And now your heart is aching
And you know there's no mistaking
'Cause you feel your life line breaking (keep running, keep running)
Can feel your hands are shaking (keep running, keep running)
No one answers the telephone
You can never, never, never go home alone
And now your heart is aching
And you know there's no mistaking
The footsteps close behind

Now, don't pretend that you sleep at night, well, sleep tight
And can't you feel that the time is right? it's alright
With a bang, bang, bang, down you go
No one really cares
'Cause the harder you run, and the harder you fall
I'm coming down hard on you
(Hard on you)
I hope my aim is true

I got a name, and I got a number, I got a line on you
I got a name, I got a number, I'm coming after you
I got a name, and I got a number, I got a line on you
I got a name, and I got a number, I got a job to do



I must've dreamed a thousand dreams
Been haunted by a million screams
But I can hear the marching feet
They're moving into the street

Now did you read the news today ?
They say the danger's gone away
But I can see the fires still alight
They're burning into the night

There's too many men, too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go round
Can't you see this is a land of confusion ?

[Chorus]
This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in

Ooh, Superman, where are you now ?
When everything's gone wrong somehow
The men of steel, the men of power
Are losing control by the hour

This is the time, this is the place
So we look for the future
But there's not much love to go round
Tell me why this is a land of confusion

[Chorus]
This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in

[Bridge]
I remember long ago
Ooh when the sun was shining
Yes and the stars were bright all through the night
And the sound of your laughter as I held you tight
So long ago

I won't be coming home tonight
My generation will put it right
We're not just making promises
That we know we'll never keep

Too many men, there's too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go round
Can't you see this is a land of confusion ?

[Chorus]
Now this is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth fighting for
This is the world we live in
And these are the names we're given
Stand up and let's start showing
Just where our lives are going to



Times have changed and times are strange
Here I come, but I ain't the same
Mama, I'm coming home
Time's gone by,it seems to be
You could have been a better friend to me
Mama, I'm coming home

You took me in and you me drove out
Yeah, you had me hypnotized, yeah
Lost and found and turned around
By the fire in your eyes

You made me cry, you told me lies
But I can't stand to say goodbye
Mama, I'm coming home
I could be right, I could be wrong
It hurts so bad, it's been so long
Mama, I'm coming home

Selfish love, yeah we're both alone
The ride before the fall, yeah
But I'm gonna take this heart of stone
I've just got to have it all

I've seen your face a hundred times
Every day we've been apart
I don't care about the sunshine, yeah
Cause Mama, Mama, I'm coming home
I'm coming home

You took me in and you drove me out
Yeah, you had me hypnotized, yeah
Lost and found and turned around
By the fire in your eyes

I've seen your face a thousand times
Every day we've been apart
I don't care about the sunshine, yeah
Cause Mama, Mama I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home



See the lonely man there on the corner
What he's waiting for, I don't know
But he waits every day now
He's just waiting for something to show

And nobody knows him, and nobody cares
'Cause there's no hidin' place
There's no hidin' place
For you

Lookin' everywhere at no one
He sees everything and nothing at all, oh
When he shouts, nobody listens
Where he leads, no one will go, oh

He's a lonely man there on the corner
What he's waiting for, I don't know
But he waits every day now
He's just waiting for something to show

And nobody knows him, and nobody cares
'Cause there's no hidin' place
There's no hidin' place
For you and me

Are we just like all the rest?
We're lookin' too hard for somethin' he's got
Or movin' too fast to rest
But like a monkey on your back, you need it
But do you love it enough to leave it all?

Just like the lonely man there on the corner
What he's waiting for, I don't know
But he waits every day now
He's just waiting for that somethin' to show

Who the lonely man there on the corner
What he's waiting for, I don't know
But he's there every day now
He's just waiting for that somethin' to show

Who the lonely man there on the corner
What he's waiting for, I don't know
But he waits every day now
He's just waiting for that somethin' to show



There must be some misunderstanding
There must be some kind of mistake
I waited in the rain for hours
You were late

Now it's not like me to say the right thing
But you could've called to let me know
I checked your number twice, don't understand it
So I went home

Well I'd been waiting for this weekend
I thought that maybe we could see a show
Never dreamed I'd have this feeling
But seeing you is believing
That's why I don't know why
You didn't show up that night

There must be some misunderstanding
There must be some kind of mistake
I was waiting in the rain for hours
You were late

Since then I've been running around trying to find you
I went to the places that you always go
I rang your house but got no answer
Jumped in my car, i went round there
I still don't believe it
He was just leaving

There must be some misunderstanding
There must be some kind of mistake



Talk to me, you never talk to me
Ooh, it seems that I can speak
I can hear my voice shoutin' out

But there's no reply at all

Look at me, you never look at me
Ooh, I've been sittin, starin', seems so long
But you're lookin' through me
Like I wasn't here at all

No reply. There's no reply at all

Dance with me, you never dance with me
Ooh, it seems that I can move
I'm close to you, close as I can get

Yet there's no reply at all
There's no reply at all

Be with me. Seems you're never here with me
Ooh, I've been tryin' to get over there
Oh, but it's out of my reach

And there's no reply at all
There's no reply at all

I get the feelin' you're tryin' to tell me
Is there somethin' that I should know?
What excuse are you tryin' to sell me?
Should I be readin' stop or go?
I don't know

Be with me. Seems you're never here with me
Ooh, I've been tryin' to get over there
Oh, but it's out of my reach

And there's no reply at all
There's no reply at all

I get the feelin' you're tryin' to tell me
Is there somethin' that I should know?
What excuse are you tryin' to sell me?
Should I be readin' stop or go?
I don't know

Maybe deep down inside
I'm tryin' for no one else but me
Too stubborn to say, "The buck stops here
It's not the one you're lookin' for."

But maybe deep down inside, I'm lyin'
To no one else but me
Oh, but my back is up. I'm on my guard
With all the exits sealed

Listen to me, you never listen to me
Oooh, and it seems there's no way out
I've been tryin' but we cannot connect

And there's no reply at all
There's no reply at all
There's no reply at all
No reply at all
Is anybody list'nin?
Oh, there's no reply at all...



{Intro}

Just as I thought, it was going alright
I found out I'm wrong, when I thought I was right
Its always the same, its just a shame, that's all

I could say day, and you'd say night
Tell me it's black, when I know that it's white
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all

I could leave, but I won't go
Though my heart might tell me so
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes

Why does it always seem to be
Me looking at you, you looking at me
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all

Turning me on, turning me off
Making me feel like I want too much
Living with you is just putting me through it all of the time

Running around, staying out all night
Taking it all instead of taking one bite
Living with you is just putting me through it all the time

I could leave, but I won't go
But it'd be easier I know
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes

Why does it always seem to be
Me looking at you, you looking at me
It's always the same, its just a shame, that's all

Truth is I love you, more then I wanted to
There's no point in trying to pretend
There's been no one who makes me feel like you do
Say we'll be together til the end

{Bridge}

I could leave but I won't go
It would be easier, I know
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes

So why does it always seem to be
Me looking at you, you looking at me
It's always the same, its just a shame, that's all

But I love you, more then I wanted to
There's no point in trying to pretend
There's been no one who makes me feel like you do
Say we'll be together til the end

But just as I thought it was going alright
I found out I'm wrong when I thought I was right
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all

Well I can say day, you'd say night
Tell me it's black when I know that it's white
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all
That's all

And the lamb lies down on Broadway

Early morning Manhattan
Ocean winds blow on the land
The Movie-Palace is now undone
The all-night watchmen have had their fun
Sleeping cheaply on the midnight show
It's the same old ending - time to go
Get out!
It seems they cannot leave their dream
There's something moving in the sidewalk steam
And the lamb lies down on Broadway

Nightime's flyers feel their pains
Drugstore takes down the chains
Metal motion comes in bursts
But the gas station can quench that thirst
Suspension cracked on unmade road
The trucker's eyes read 'Overload'
And out of the subway
Rael Imperial Aerosol Kid
Exits into daylight, spraygun hid
And the lamb lies down on Broadway

The lamb seems right out of place
Yet the Broadway street scene finds a focus in its face
Somehow it's lying there
Brings a stillness to the air
Though man-made light, at night is very bright
There's no whitewash victim
As the neons dim, to the coat of white
Rael Imperial Aerosol Kid
Wipes his gun-he's forgotten what he did
And the lamb lies down on Broadway

Suzanne tired her work all done
Thinks money-honey-be on-neon
Cabman's velvet glove sounds the horn
And the sawdust king spits out his scorn
Wonder women draw your blind!
Don't look at me! I'm not your kind
I'm Rael!
Something inside me has just begun
Lord knows what I have done
And the lamb lies down on Broadway
On Broadway ...
They say the lights are always bright on Broadway
They say there's always magic in the air



I'm coming down, coming down like a monkey, but it's alright
Like a load on your back that you can't see, ooh but it's alright
Try to shake it loose, cut it free, just let it go, get it away from me

'Cause tonight, tonight, tonight - oh, I'm gonna make it right
Tonight, tonight, tonight - oh

I'm going down, going down, like a monkey, ooh but it's alright
Try to pick yourself up, carry that weight that you can't see
Don't you know it's alright
It's like a helter skelter, going down and down, round and round
But just get it away from me - oh

Because tonight, tonight, tonight - oh
We're gonna make it right
Tonight, tonight, tonight - oh

I got some money in my pocket, about ready to burn
I don't remember where I got it, I gotta get it to you
So please answer the phone, 'cause I keep calling, but you're never home
What am I gonna do?
Tonight, tonight, tonight - oh
I'm gonna make it right
Tonight, tonight, tonight - oh

You keep telling me I've got everything, you say I've got everything I want
You keep telling me you're gonna help me, you're gonna help me, but you don't
But now I'm in too deep
You see it's got me so that I just can't sleep
Oh get me out of here, please get me out of here
Just help me I'll do anything, anything
If you'll just help me get out of here

I'm coming down, coming down like a monkey, ooh but it's alright
It's like a load on your back that you can't see
Ooh don't you know that it's alright
Just try to shake it loose, cut it free, let it go
But just get it away from me
'Cause tonight, tonight, tonight - oh
Maybe we'll make it right
Tonight, tonight, tonight - oh

Please get me out of here
Someone get me out of here
Just help me I'll do anything, anything
If you'll just help get me out of here
Tonight - oh, I'm gonna make it right
Tonight, tonight, tonight - oh

Yes tonight, tonight, tonight - oh
Yes I'm gonna make it right, tonight, tonight, tonight - oh...



(One, two, three, four!)

All I need is a TV show, that and the radio
Down on my luck again, down on my luck again
I can show you I can show you some of the people in my life
I can show you I can show you some of the people in my life
It's driving me mad just another way of passing the day
I, I get so lonely when she's not there
I, I, I...

You're just another face that I know from the TV show
I have known you for so very long I feel you like a friend
Can't you do anything for me, can I touch you for a while
Can I meet you another day and we will fly away

I can show you I can show you some of the people in my life
I can show you I can show you some of the people in my life
It's driving me mad it's just another way of passing the day
I, I get so lonely when she's not there
I, I, I...

Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on again
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on again (I can see another face)
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on again (I can see another face)
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on again

But it's going to take money
A whole lot of spending money
It's going to take plenty of money

To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it

{Intro}

On the day I was born, the nurses all gathered 'round
And they gazed in wide wonder, at the joy they had found
The head nurse spoke up, said leave this one alone
She could tell right away, that I was bad to the bone
Bad to the bone
Bad to the bone
B-B-B-B-Bad
B-B-B-B-Bad
B-B-B-B-Bad
Bad to the bone

I broke a thousand hearts, before I met you
I'll break a thousand more baby, before I am through
I wanna be yours pretty baby, yours and yours alone
I'm here to tell ya honey, that I'm bad to the bone
Bad to the bone
B-B-B-Bad
B-B-B-Bad
B-B-B-Bad
Bad to the bone

{Bridge}

I make a rich woman beg, I'll make a good woman steal
I'll make an old woman blush, and make a young woman squeal
I wanna be yours pretty baby, yours and yours alone
I'm here to tell ya honey, that I'm bad to the bone
B-B-B-B-Bad
B-B-B-B-Bad
B-B-B-B-Bad
Bad to the bone

{Bridge}

Now when I walk the streets
Kings and queens step aside
Every woman I meet, they all stay satisfied
I wanna tell ya pretty baby, what I see I make my own
And I'm here to tell ya honey that I'm bad to the bone
B-B-B-B-Bad
B-B-B-B-Bad
B-B-B-B-Bad
Bad to the bone

{Outro}



I rode a streak of lightening on the night you said goodbye
I rode a streak of lightening on the night you said goodbye
Well If I never make it baby you can't say I didn't try

Well I went up that highway they call highway 95
Well I went up that highway they call highway 95
When I cruise back to you baby your heart will come alive

Well I grew up with rock and roll but these blues wouldn't leave me alone
Well I grew up with rock and roll but these blues wouldn't leave me alone
I didn't know what they meant 'til I ran far from home
Well alright



I was a rebel from the day I left school
Grew my hair long and broke all the rules
I'd sit and listen to my records all day
With big ambitions of when I could play

My parents taught me what life was about
So I grew up the type they warned me about
They said my friends were just an unruly mob
And I should get a haircut and get a real job

Get a haircut and get a real job
Clean your act up and don't be a slob
Get it together like your big brother Bob
Why don't you get a haircut and get a real job

I even tried that nine to five scene
I told myself that it was all a bad dream
I found a band and some good songs to play
Now I party all night, I sleep all day

I met this chick, she was my number one fan
She took me home to meet her mommy and dad
They took one look at me and said "Oh my god!"
Get a haircut and get a real job

Get a haircut and get a real job
Clean your act up and don't be a slob
Get it together like your big brother Bob
Why don't you get a haircut and get a real job

Get a real job, why don't you get a real job
Get a real job, why don't you get a real job

I hit the big time with my rock and roll band
The future's brighter now than I'd ever planned
I'm ten times richer than my big brother Bob
But he's got a haircut he's got a real job

Get a haircut and get a real job
Clean your act up and don't be a slob
Get it together like your big brother Bob
Why don't you get a haircut and get a real job

Get a real job, why don't you get a real job
Get a real job, why don't you get a real

I walked forty-seven miles of barbed wire
I got a cobra snake for a necktie
A brand new house on the road side
And it's a-made out of rattlesnake hide
Got a band new chimney put on top
And it's a-made out of human skull
Come on take a little walk with me baby
And tell me who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?

Around the town I use a rattlesnake whip
Take it easy baby don't you give me no lip
Who do you love?
Who do you love?

I've got a tombstone hand and a graveyard mind
I'm just twenty-two and I don't mind dying
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?

Now Arlene took a-me by my hand
She said "Lonesome George you don't understand
Who do you love? "
The night were dark and the sky were blue
Down the alleyway a house wagon flew
Hit a bump and somebody screamed
You should've heard what I'd seen
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?

Yeah, I've got a tombstone hand in a graveyard mine
Just twenty-two baby I don't mind dying
Snake skin shoes baby put them on your feet
Got the goodtime music and the Bo Diddley beat
Who do you love?
Who do you love?

I walked forty-seven miles of barbed wire
I got a cobra snake for a necktie
A brand new house on the road side
And it's made out of rattlesnake hide
Got a band new chimney put on top
And it's made out of human skull
Come on take a little walk with me child
Tell me who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?



I got a little change in my pocket going jing-a-ling-a-ling
Wanna call you on the telephone, baby, I give you a ring
But each time we talk, I get the same old thing
Always, "No huggee, no kissee until I get a wedding ring"

My honey, my baby
Don't put my love upon no shelf
She said
"Don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself"

Ooh, baby, baby, baby
Why you gonna treat me this way?
You know I'm still your loverboy
I still feel the same way
That's when she told me a story 'bout free milk and a cow
And said
"No huggee, no kissee until I get a wedding vow"

My honey, my baby
Don't put my love upon no shelf
She said
"Don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself"

You see, I wanted her real bad and I was about to give in
That's when she started talking about true love
Started talking about sin

I said
"Honey, I'll live with you for the rest of my life"
She said
No huggee, no kissee until you make me a wife"

My honey, my baby
Don't put my love upon no shelf
She said
"Don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself"



You know I need your love
You've got that hold over me
Long as I've got your love
You know that I'll never leave
When I wanted you to share my life
I had no doubt in my mind
And it's been you woman
Right down the line

I know how much I lean on you
Only you can see
The changes that I've been through
Have left a mark on me
You've been as constant as a Northern Star
The brightest light that shines
It's been you woman right down the line

I just wanna say this is my way
Of telling you everything
I could never say before
Yeah this is my way of telling you
That every day I'm loving you so much more
Cause you believed in me through my darkest night
Put something better inside of me
You brought me into the light
Threw away all those crazy dreams
I put them all behind
And it was you woman
Right down the line

I just wanna say this is my way of telling you everything
I could never say before
Yeah this is my way of telling you
Everything I could never say before
Yeah this is my way of telling you
That every day I'm loving you so much more

If I should doubt myself, if I'm losing ground
I won't turn to someone else
They'd only let me down
When I wanted you to share my life
I had no doubt in my mind
And it's been you woman
Right down the line



All last summer in case you don't recall
I was yours and you were mine forget it all
Is there a line that I could write
That's sad enough to make you cry?
And all the lines you wrote to me were lies

Months roll past, the love that you struck dead
Did you love me only in my head?
There were things you said and did to me
They seem to come so easily
The love I thought I'd won you give for free

Whispers at the bus stop
Well I've heard about nights out in the school yard
I found out about you
I found out about you

Rumors follow everywhere you go
Like when you left and I was last to know
Well you're famous now and there's no doubt
In all the places you hang out
They know your name and they know what you're about

Whispers at the bus stop
Well I've heard about nights out in the school yard
I found out about you
I found out about you

Street lights blink on through the car window
I get the time too often on AM radio
Well you know it's all I think about
I write your name, drive past your house
Your boyfriend's over, I watch your lights go out

Whispers at the bus stop
Well I've heard about nights out in the school yard
I found out about you
I found out about you

Whispers at the bus stop
Well I've heard about nights out in the school yard
I found out about you
I found out about you

I found about you



Tell me do you think it'd be all right
If I could just crash here tonight
You can see I'm in no shape for driving
And anyway I've got no place to go
And you know it might not be that bad
You were the best I'd ever had
If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago
I might not be alone

[Chorus:]
Tomorrow we can drive around this town
And let the cops chase us around
The past is gone but something might be found
To take its place...hey jealousy
Hey jealousy
Hey jealousy
Hey jealousy

You can trust me not to think
And not to sleep around
If you don't expect too much from me
You might not be let down
Cause all I really want is to be with you
Feeling like I matter too
If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago
I might be here with you

[Chorus ]
Tomorrow we can drive around this town
And let the cops chase us around
The past is gone but something might be found
To take its place...hey jealousy
Tomorrow we can drive around this town
And let the cops chase us around
The past is gone but something might be found
To take its place...hey jealousy
Hey jealousy
Tell me do you think it'd be all right
If I could just crash here tonight
You can see I'm in no shape for driving
And anyway I've got no place to go
And you know it might not be that bad
You were the best I'd ever had
If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago
I might not be alone

[Chorus]
Tomorrow we can drive around this town
And let the cops chase us around
The past is gone but something might be found
To take its place...hey jealousy

Hey jealousy
She took my heart
Well there's only one thing I couldn't start



There's trouble on the street tonight
I can feel it in my bones
I had a premonition that
He should not go alone

I knew the gun was loaded
But I didn`t think he`d kill
Everything exploded
And the blood began to spill

So, baby
Here's your ticket
Put the suitcase in your hand
Here's a little money now

Do it just the way we planned
You be cool for twenty hours
And I`ll pay you twenty grand

I`m sorry it went down like this
Someone had to lose
It`s the nature of the business
It`s the smuggler's blues
Smuggler's blues

The sailors and the pilots
The soldiers and the law
The payoffs and the ripoffs
And the things nobody saw

No matter if it's heroin
Cocaine or hash
You`ve got to carry weapons
Cause you always carry cash

Thre`s lots of shady characters
Lots of dirty deals
Every name's an alias
In case somebody squeals

It's the lure of easy money
It's gotta very strong appeal
Perhaps you'd understand it better
Standing in my shoes

It's the ultimate enticement
It's the smuggler`s blues
Smuggler`s blues

See it in the headlines
You hear it every day
They say they`re gonna stop it
But it doesn`t go away

They move it through Miami
Sell it in L.A
They hide it up in Telluride
I mean it`s here to stay

It's propping up the governments
Of Columbia and Peru
You ask any DEA man
He`ll say there`s nothing we can do

From the office of the President
Right down
To me and you
Me and you

It`s a losing proposition
But one you can`t refuse
It`s the politics of contraband
It`s the smuggler's blues
Smuggler's blues



[Verse 1]
The sun goes down
The night rolls in
You can feel it
Starting all over again
The moon comes up
And the music calls
You're getting tired of
Staring at the same four walls
You're out of your room
And down on the street
Moving through the crowd
In the midnight heat
The traffic roars
The sirens scream
You look at the faces
It's just like a dream
Nobody knows where you're going
Nobody cares where you've been

[Chorus]
Cause you belong to the city
You belong to the night
Living in a river of darkness
Beneath the neon light
You were born in the city
Concrete under your feet
It's in your moves
It's in your blood
You're a man of the street

[Verse 2]
When you said goodbye
You were on the run
Trying to get away
From the things you've done
Now you're back again
And you're feeling strange
So much has happened
But nothing has changed
You still don't know
Where you're going
You're still just a face in the crowd

[Chorus]
Cause you belong to the city
You belong to the night
Living in a river of darkness
Beneath the neon light
You were born in the city
Concrete under your feet
It's in your moves
It's in your blood
You're a man of the street

[Bridge:]
You can feel it
You can taste it
You can see it
You can face it
You can hear it
You're getting near it
You wanna make it
Cause you can take it

(Alternate Chorus)
You belong to the city
You belong to the night
You belong to the city
You belong to the night
You belong
You belong



If your circles could be spirals
And your idols weren't machines
If you could pick up all the signals
And flash on where you've been

Maybe you don't feel it at all
It's your own fault, crawl boy crawl
You could quit the miming
Try some different timing
You could get a chance to be free--

Are you receiving me?
It's the pilot's plea
Are you receiving me?
Close to insanity
Are you receiving me?
Recharge your battery
Oooh, Are you receiving me?

If your prayers could all be answered
You were given time to pay
The chances would be so heavy
But you'd find a better way

Maybe you don't feel it at all
It's your own fault, crawl boy crawl
You can quit the miming
Try some different timing
You could get a chance to be free--

Are you receiving me?
It's the pilot's plea
Are you receiving me?
Close to insanity
Are you receiving me?
Recharge your battery
Oooh, Are you receiving me?



[Verse 1: Golden Earring]

I’ve been driving all night
My hand’s wet on the wheel
There’s a voice in my head that drives my heel
It’s my baby calling
Says "I need you here"
And it’s half past four and I’m shifting gear

[Hook 1: Golden Earring]

When she’s lonely and the longing gets too much
She sends a cable coming in from above
Don’t need no phone at all
We’ve got a thing that’s called Radar Love
We’ve got a wave in the air
Radar Love

[Verse 2: Golden Earring]

The radio’s playing some forgotten song
Brenda Lee’s "Coming on Strong"
The road has got me hypnotized
And I’m speeding into a new sunrise

[Hook 2: Golden Earring]

When I get lonely and I’m sure I’ve had enough
She sends her comfort coming in from above
Don’t need no letter at all
We’ve got a thing that’s called Radar Love
We’ve got a line in the sky
Radar Love

[Verse 3: Golden Earring]

No more speed I’m almost there
Gotta keep cool now gotta take care
Last car to pass here I go
And the line of cars drove down real slow
And the radio played that forgotten song
Brenda Lee’s "Coming on Strong"
And the newsman sang his same song
One more radar love is gone

[Hook 2: Golden Earring]
When I get lonely and I’m sure I’ve had enough
She sends her comfort coming in from above
Don’t need no letter at all
We’ve got a thing that’s called Radar Love
We’ve got a line in the sky
Radar Love

[Outro: Golden Earring]

We’ve got a thing that’s called Radar Love
We’ve got a thing that’s called Radar Love



Somewhere in a lonely hotel room
There's a guy starting to realize
That his eternal fate has turned its back on him
It's two A.M

It's two A.M., the fear has gone
I'm sitting here waitin', the gun still warm
Maybe my connection is tired of takin' chances

Yeah, there's a storm on the loose, sirens in my head
Wrapped up in silence, all circuits are dead
Cannot decode, my whole life spins into a frenzy

Help, I'm steppin' into the Twilight Zone
Place is a madhouse, feels like being cloned
My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go now that I've gone too far?

Help, I'm steppin' into the Twilight Zone
Place is a madhouse, feels like being cloned
My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go now that I've gone too far?

Soon you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone
Soon you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone

I'm falling down the spiral destination unknown
Double crossed messenger all alone
Can't get no connection, can't get through
Where are you?

Well the night weighs heavy on his guilty mind
This far from the borderline
When the hitman comes
He knows damn well he has been cheated

And he says, "Help, I'm steppin' into the Twilight Zone
Place is a madhouse, feels like being cloned
My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go now that I've gone too far?"

Help, I'm steppin' into the Twilight Zone
Place is a madhouse, feels like being cloned
My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go now that I've gone too far?

Soon you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone
Soon you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone

When the bullet hits the bone

Help, I'm steppin' into the Twilight Zone
Place is a madhouse, feels like being cloned
My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go now that I've gone too far?

Help, I'm steppin' into the Twilight Zone
Place is a madhouse, feels like being cloned
My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go now that I've gone too far?

Soon you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone
Soon you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone

Soon you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone
Soon you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone

When the bullet hits the bone, a ha
When the bullet hits the bone
When the bullet hits the bone, a ha
When the bullet hits the bone

When the bullet hits the bone, a ha
When the bullet hits the bone
When the bullet hits the bone, a ha
When the bullet hits the bone



I can see her lyin' back in her satin dress
In a room where ya do what ya don't confess

Sundown ya better take care
If I find you been creepin' 'round my back stairs
Sundown ya better take care
If I find you been creepin' 'round my back stairs

She's been lookin' like a queen in a sailor's dream
And she don't always say what she really means

Sometimes I think it's a shame
When I get feelin' better when I'm feelin' no pain
Sometimes I think it's a shame
When I get feelin' better when I'm feelin' no pain

I can picture every move that a man could make
Getting lost in her lovin' is your first mistake

Sundown ya better take care
If I find you been creepin' 'round my back stairs
Sometimes I think it's a sin
When I feel like I'm winnin' when I'm losin' again

I can see her lookin' fast in her faded jeans
She's a hard lovin' woman, got me feelin' mean

Sometimes I think it's a shame
When I get feelin' better when I'm feelin' no pain
Sundown ya better take care
If I find you been creepin' 'round my back stairs
Sundown ya better take care
If I find you been creepin' 'round my back stairs
Sometimes I think it's a sin
When I feel like I'm winnin' when I'm losin' again



When you can't find the light
That guides you through a cloudy day
When the stars ain't shinin' bright
And you feel like you've lost you're way
When those candle lights of home
Burn so very far away
Well you got to let your soul shine
Just like my daddy used to say

He used to say soul shine
It's better than sunshine
It's better than moonshine
Damn sure better than rain
Hey now people don't mind
We all feel this way sometimes
Got to let your soul shine
Shine 'till the break of day

I grew up thinkin' that I had it made
Gonna make it on my own
Life can take the strongest man
Make him feel so alone
Now and then I feel a cold wind
Blowin' through my achin' bones
I think back to what my daddy said
He said "Boy, in the darkness before the dawn"

Let your soul shine
It's better than sunshine
It's better than moonshine
Damn sure better than rain

Hey now people don't mind
We all get this way sometimes
Gotta let your soul shine
Shine 'till the break of day

Sometimes a man can feel this emptiness
Like a woman has robbed him of his very soul
A woman too, God knows, she can feel like this
And when your world seems cold
You got to let your spirit take control

Talkinbout soul shine
It's better than sunshine
It's better than moonshine
Damn sure better than rain
Lord now people don't mind
We all feel this way sometimes
Gotta let your soul shine
Shine till the break of day

I said it's better than sunshine
It's better than moonshine
Damn sure better than rain
Yeah now people don't mind
We all get this way sometimes
Gotta let your soul shine
Shine 'till the break of day



I'm in love with the girl that I'm talking about
I'm in love with the girl I can't live without
I'm in love but I sure picked a bad time
To be in love
To be in love

Well, let her be somebody else's queen
I don't want to know about it
There's too many others that know what I mean
And that's why I got to live without it

I'm in love with the girl I'm talking about
I'm in love with the girl I can't live without
I'm in love but I feel like I'm wearin' it out
I'm in love but I must have picked a bad time to be in love
A bad time to be in love
A bad time to be in love
A bad time to be in love

All the stories coming back to me
From my friends and the people I don't want to see
The things they say I know just couldn't be true
At least not until I hear it from you

'Cause I still love the little girl I'm talking about
I'm in love with the girl I can't live without
I'm in love but I feel like I'm wearin' it out
I'm in love but I must have picked a bad time to be in love
A bad time to be in love
A bad time to be in love
A bad time to be in love

You know that I love the little girl I'm talking about
I'm in love with the girl I can't live without
I'm in love but it feels like I'm wearin' it out
I'm in love but I must have picked a bad time to be in love
A bad time to be in love
A bad time to be in love
A bad time to be in love



Everybody, listen to me
And return me my ship
I'm your captain, I'm your captain
Though I'm feeling mighty sick

I've been lost now for days uncounted
And it's months since I've seen home
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?
Or am I all alone?

If you return me to my home port
I will kiss you, Mother Earth
Take me back now, take me back now
To the port of my birth

Am I in my cabin dreaming?
Or are you really scheming
To take my ship away from me?
You'd better think about it
I just can't live without it
So please don't take my ship from me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I can feel the hand of a stranger
And it's tightening 'round my throat
Heaven help me, heaven help me
Take this stranger from my boat

I'm your captain, I'm your captain
Though I'm feeling mighty sick
Everybody, listen to me
And return me my ship

I'm your captain
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm your captain
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm your captain
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm your captain
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

A little bit of rhythm and a lot of soul
So, come on, come on, and do the Loco-Motion with me

[Verse 1]
I don't need a whole lots of money
I don't need a big fine car
I got everything that a man could want
I got more than I could ask for
I don't have to run around
I don't have to stay out all night
Cause I got me a sweet ... a sweet, lovin' woman
And she knows just how to treat me right

[Chorus]
Well my baby, she's alright
Well my baby, she's clean out-of-sight
Don't you know that she's ... she's some kind of wonderful
She's some kind of wonderful ... yes she is, she's
She's some kind of wonderful, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahhh ...

[Verse 2]
When I hold her in my arms
You know she sets my soul on fire
Oooh, when my baby kisses me
My heart becomes filled with desire
When she wraps her lovin' arms around me
About drives me out of my mind
Yeah, when my baby kisses me
Chills run up and down my spine

[Chorus]
Well my baby, she's alright
Well my baby, she's clean out-of-sight
Don't you know that she is ... she's some kind of wonderful
She's some kind of wonderful ... yes she is

{Intro}

On the road for forty days
Last night in Little Rock put me in a haze
Sweet, sweet Connie - doing her act
She had the whole show and that's a natural fact

Up all night with Freddy King
I got to tell you poker's his thing
A-booze 'n ladies keep me right
As long as we can make it to the show tonight

We're an American band
We're an American band
We're coming to your town, we'll help you party it down
We're an American band

{Hook}

Four young chiquitas in Omaha
Was waitin' for the band to return from the show
Feelin' good, feelin' right, it's Saturday night
The hotel detective -- he was out-a-sight

Now, these fine ladies, they had a plan
They was out to meet the boys in the band
They said, "Come on, dudes, let's get it on,"
And we proceeded to tear that hotel down

We're an American band
We're an American band
We're coming to your town, we'll help you party it down
We're an American band

We're an American band
We're an American band
We're coming to your town, we'll help you party it down
We're an American band

{Bridge}

We're an American band
We're an American band
We're coming to your town, we'll help you party it down
We're an American band

We're an American band
We're an American band
We're coming to your town, we'll help you party it down
We're an American band

We're an American Band, Ooo-ooo
We're an American Band, Ooo-ooo
We're an American Band, Ooo-ooo



[Verse 1]
Thirty two teeth in a jawbone
Alabama's tryin' for none
Before I have to hit him
I hope he's got the sense to run

Reason the poor girls love him
Promise them everything
Why they all believe him?
He wears a big diamond ring

[Chorus]
Alabama getaway, getaway
Alabama getaway, getaway
Only way to please me
Just get down and leave and walk away

[Verse 2]
Majordomo Billy Bojangles
Sat down and had a drink with me
Said what about Alabama
That keeps a-coming back to me?

I heard your plea in the courthouse
Witness box began to rock and rise
Forty-nine sister states
Had Alabama in their eyes

[Chorus]
Alabama getaway, getaway
Alabama getaway, getaway
Only way to please me
Just get down and leave and walk away

[Verse 3]
Major said why don't we give him
Rope enough to hang himself?
No need to worry the jury
They'll probably take care of themselves
Twenty-third Psalm Majordomo
Reserve me a table for three
Down in the Valley of the Shadow
Just you, Alabama and me

[Chorus]
Alabama getaway, getaway
Alabama getaway, getaway
Only way to please me
Just get down and leave and walk away



[Verse]
Bringing me down
I'm running aground
Blind in the light of the interstate cars
Passing me by
The busses and semis
Plunging like stones from a slingshot on Mars
But I'm here by the road
Bound to the load
That I picked up in ten thousand cafes and bars
Alone with the rush of the drivers who won't pick me up
The highway, the moon, the clouds, and the stars
The black-throated wind keeps on pouring in
With its words of a life where nothing is new
Ah, Mother American Night, I'm lost from the light
Ohhh, I'm drowning in you
I left St. Louis, the City of Blues
In the midst of a storm I'd rather forget
I tried to pretend it came to an end
Because you weren't the woman I thought I once met
But I can't deny that times have gone by
When I never had doubts or thoughts of regret
And I was a man when all this began
Who wouldn't think twice about being there yet
The black-throated wind keeps on pouring in
And it speaks of a life that passes like dew
It's forced me to see that you've done better by me
Better by me than I've done by you
What's to be found, racing around
You carry your pain wherever you go
Full of the blues and trying to lose
You ain't gonna learn what you don't want to know
So I give you my eyes, and all of their lies
Please help them to learn as well as to see
Capture a glance and make it a dance
Of looking at you looking at me
The black-throated wind keeps on pouring in
With its words of a lie that could almost be true
Ah, Mother American Night, here comes the light
I'm turning around, that's what I'm going to do

[Outro]
Going back home that's what I'm going to do
Turning around
That's what I'm going to do
Because you've done better by me
Than I've done by you



Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

This old engine
Makes it on time
Leaves Central Station
At a quarter to nine
Hits river junction
At seventeen to
At a quarter to ten
You know it's traveling again

Driving that train
High on cocaine
Casey Jones you better
Watch your speed
Trouble ahead
Trouble behind
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind

Trouble ahead
A lady in red
Take my advice
You'd be better off dead
Switch-man sleeping
Train hundred and two
Is on the wrong track
And headed for you

Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

Trouble with you is
The trouble with me
Got two good eyes
But we still don't see
Come round the bend
You know it's the end
The fireman screams and
The engine just gleams

Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind



Take it, you can have it, what I got baby, I can't hold
And if you find the secret tell me how to build the mold
And I can't handle your problems so don't try to handle mine
Get yourself a shotgun, a pocketful of shells
And we can while away the time
Look up the wall, do it right, make a mistake
You're going to pay for it twice
But if you need it, got to have it get yourself
A shotgun and bring it back home
Look up the wall, you know you got to call
Before you start falling, get ready to fall
And if you fallin my direction
Don't expect no help at all.... Don't
Get it right, do it nice
And if you make a mistake, you're going to pay for it twice
But if you need it, got to have it get yourself
A shotgun and bring it back home
Look up the wall, you know you got to call
But if you start falling, be ready to fall
And if you fall in my direction
Don't expect no help at all, don't expect no help at all
Don't expect no help at all, and if you fall in my direction
Don't expect no help at all



I lit out from Reno, I was trailed by twenty hounds
Didn't get to sleep last night till the morning came around

Set out runnin but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight, I just might get some sleep tonight

Ran into the devil, babe, he loaned me twenty bills
I spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills

Set out runnin but I take my time, a friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight, I just might get some sleep tonight

I ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there
He took my twenty dollar bill and vanished in the air

Set out runnin but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight, I just might get some sleep tonight

[instrumental verse]

Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night:
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie, and she's my heart's delight
The second one is prison, babe, the sheriff's on my trail
And if he catches up with me, I'll spend my life in jail

Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee
The first one says she's got my child, but it don't look like me

Set out runnin but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight, I just might get some sleep tonight



[Verse 1]
Well I was drinkin' last night with a biker
And I showed him a picture of you
I said, "Pal, get to know her. You'll like her"
Seemed like the least I could do...

'Cause when he's driving his chopper
Up and down your carpeted halls
You will think me by contrast quite proper
Never mind how I stumble and fall
Never mind how I stumble and fall

[Chorus]
You imagine me sipping champagne from
Your boot
For a taste of your elegant pride
I may be going to hell in a bucket, babe
But at least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride

[Verse 2]
Now miss sweet little soft-core pretender
Somehow baby got hard as it gets
With her black leather chrome-spiked
Suspenders
Her chain and her whip and her pets

Well we know you're the reincarnation
Of the ravenous Catherine the Great
And we know how you love your ovations
For the Z-rated scenes you create
The Z-rated scenes you create

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You analyze me, pretend to despise me
You laugh when I stumble and fall
There may come a day I will dance on your grave
Unable to dance, I will crawl across it
Unable to dance, I'll still crawl
Unable to dance I'll crawl

You must really consider the circus
'Cause it just might be your kind of zoo
I can't think of a place that's more perfect
For a person as perfect as you

And it's not like I'm leaving you lonely
'Cause I wouldn't know where to begin
But I know that you'll think of me only
When the snakes come marching in
When the snakes come marching in

[Chorus]
You imagine me sipping champagne from your boot
For taste of your elegant pride
I may be going to hell in a bucket, babe
But at least I'm enjoying the ride, at least I'll enjoy the ride
Ride, ride, ride [x3]
At least I'll enjoy the ride [x3]



[Verse 1]
Busted flat in Baton Rouge, waiting for a train
When I was feeling nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down, just before it rained
And rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
I was playing soft while Bobby sung the blues, yeah
Windshield wipers slapping time I was holding Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew

[Chorus]
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose
Nothing, I mean nothing, honey if it isn't free, no no
Yeah feeling good was easy Lord, when he sang the blues
You know feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee

[Verse 2]
From the Kentucky coal mines to the California sun
Yeah, Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, through everything we done
Yeah, Bobby baby kept me from the cold
One day up near Salinas, Lord, I let him slip away
He's lookin' for that home, and I hope he finds it
But I'd trade all of my tomorrows for one single yesterday
To be holdin' Bobby's body next to mine

[Chorus]
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose
Nothing, and that's all that Bobby left me
Feeling good was easy Lord, when he sang the blues
You know feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee

[Bridge]
La da la la la, la da la la la da la
La da da la la la Bobby McGee yeah

La da la la la, la da la la la da la
La da da la la la Bobby McGee yeah

La da la la la, la da la la la da la
La da da la la la Bobby McGee yeah

La da la la la, la da la la la da la
La da da la la la Bobby McGee yeah

[Outro]
Lord, I called him my lover, I called him my man
I said called him my lover just the best I can and come on
And and a Bobby oh, and a Bobby McGee yeah
Lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo
Hey hey hey Bobby McGee, lord
La da la la la, la da la la la la la
Hey hey hey, Bobby McGee yeah



I wanna tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
I wanna love you night and day
You know my love not fade away

You know my love not fade away
Not fade away

My love is bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show you but you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real
You're gonna know just how I feel

Our love is real, not fade away
Not fade away

Going down the road feeling bad
Going down the road feeling bad
Going down the road feeling bad, hey hey hey, yeah
Don't wanna be treated this-a way

Going where the climate suits my clothes
I'm going where the climate suits my clothes
Going where the climate suits my clothes
Don't wanna be treated this-a way

Going down the road feeling bad
Well I'm, going down the road feeling bad
Going down the road feeling bad, hey hey hey, yeah
Don't wanna be treated this-a way

Going where the water tastes like wine
Well I'm, going where the water tastes like wine
Going where the water tastes like wine
I don't wanna be treated this-a way

Going down the road feeling bad
Going down the road feeling bad
Going down the road feeling bad, hey hey hey, yeah
Don't wanna be treated this-a way

Going down the road feeling bad
Going down the road feeling bad
Going down the road feeling bad, hey hey hey, yeah
Don't wanna be treated this-a way

Well I'm, going down the road feeling bad
Going down the road feeling bad
Going down the road feeling bad, hey hey hey, yeah
Don't wanna be treated this-a way



As I was walking round Grosvenor Square
Not a chill to the winter
But a nip to the air
From the other direction
She was calling my eye
It could be an illusion
But I might as well try
Might as well try

She had rings on her fingers and
Bells on her shoes
And I knew without asking she was
Into the blues
She wore scarlet begonias
Tucked into her curls
I knew right away
She was not like other girls
Other girls

In the thick of the evening
When the dealing got rough
She was too pat to open
And too cool to bluff
As I picked up my matches and
Was closing the door
I had one of those flashes:
I'd been there before
Been there before

I ain't often right
But I've never been wrong
It seldom turns out the way
It does in the song
Once in a while
You get shown the light
In the strangest of places
If you look at it right

Well, there ain't nothing wrong
With the way she moves
Or scarlet begonias or a
Touch of the blues
And there's nothing wrong with
The look that's in her eye
I had to learn the hard way
To let her pass by
Let her pass by

The wind in the willows played tea for two
The sky was yellow and the sun was blue
Strangers stopping strangers
Just to shake their hand
Everybody's playing
In the Heart of Gold Band
Heart of Gold Band



[Verse 1]
You tell me this town ain't got no heart
(Well, well, well, you can never tell)
The sunny side of the street is dark
(Well, well, well, you can never tell)
Maybe that's because it's midnight
In the dark of the moon besides

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Maybe the dark is from your eyes
(Maybe the dark is from your eyes) [x3]
You know you got such dark eyes!

[Chorus]
Nothing shaking on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just got to poke around

[Verse 2]
You think you've seen this town clear through
(Well, well, well, you can never tell)
Nothing here that could interest you
(Well, well, well, you can never tell)
It's not because you missed out
On the thing that we had to start

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Maybe you had too much too fast
(Maybe you had too much too fast) [x3]
Or just over played your part

[Chorus]
Nothing shaking on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just got to poke around

[Verse 3]
Since I'm passing your way today
(Well, well, well, you can never tell)
I just stopped in because I want to say
(Well, well, well, you can never tell)
I recall your darkness
When it crackled like a thundercloud

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
(Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart) [x3]
When I can hear it beat out loud!

[Repeat Chorus until fade]



Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming, heads all empty, and I don't care.
Saw my baby down by the river; knew she'd have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on. Under the willow, we can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

She's got everything delightful. She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double. Pays my ticket when I speed

She comes skimmin' through rays of violet. She can wade in a drop of dew
She don't come, and I don't follow. Waits backstage while I sing to you

Well, she can dance a Cajun rhythm. Jump like a willys in four wheel drive
She's a summer love for spring, fall, and winter. She can make happy any man alive

Sugar magnolia ringing that bluebell, caught up in sunlight, come on out singing;
I'll walk you in the sunshine. Come on honey. Come along with me

She's got everything delightful. She's got everything I need:
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight. Lazing in the sunshine? Yes, indeed

Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying, when the moon is half way down...
Sometimes when the night is dying, I take me out, and I wander around. I wander 'round

Sunshine daydream walking in the tall trees, going where the wind goes
Blooming like a red rose, breathing more freely
Ride our singin'; I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, Sunshine daydream walking in the sunshine



[Verse 1]
Must be getting early
Clocks are running late
Paint by number morning sky looks so phony
Dawn is breaking everywhere
Light a candle, curse the glare
Draw the curtains I don't care cause it's alright

[Chorus]
I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive

[Verse 2]
I see you've got your fists out, say your piece and get out
Guess I get the gist of it but it's alright
Sorry that you feel that way
The only thing there is to say
Every silver lining's got a touch of grey

[Chorus]
I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive

[Bridge]
It's a lesson to me
The Deltas and the East and the Freeze
The ABC's we all think of
To try to give a little love

[Verse 3]
I know the rent is in arrears, the dog has not been fed in years
It's even worse than it appears but it's alright
Cow is given kerosene
Kid can't read at seventeen
The words he knows are all obscene but it's alright

[Chorus]
I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive

[Verse 4]
The shoe is on the hand it fits
There's all there really nothing much to it
Whistle through your teeth and spit because it's alright
Oh, well, a touch of gray, kind of suits you anyway
That's was all I had to say but it's alright

[Chorus]
I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive

[Chorus 2]
We will get by
We will get by
We will get by
We will survive



Truckin', got my chips cashed in
Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

Dallas, got a soft machine;
Houston, too close to New Orleans;
New York's got the ways and means
But just won't let you be, oh no

Most of the cats that you meet on the streets speak of true love
Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they better get goin'
Out of the door and down on the streets all alone

Truckin', like the do-dah man
Once told me "You've got to play your hand"
Sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay'em down

Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, vitamin C, and cocaine
All a friend can say is "Ain't it a shame"

Truckin', up to Buffalo
Been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
Takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowlin' pin
Knocked down, it get's to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be, oh no

You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and light out and look all around

Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me;
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

Truckin', I'm a goin' home
Whoa whoa baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
Hey now get back truckin' home



[Verse 1]
Without a warning you broke my heart
Taking it baby, tore it apart
And you left me standing in a dark clime
Said your love for me was dyin'
So come on baby, baby please
I'm begging you baby, I'm on my knees

[Chorus]
Turn on your light, let it shine on me
Turn on your love light, let it shine on me
Let it shine on me let shine, let it shine, let it shine

When I get a little lonely in the middle of
The night
And I need you darling to make things all right
So come on baby, baby please
And I'm begging you baby, 'cause I'm on my knees
Turn on your lights let it shine on me
Turn on your love light let it shine on me
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine

[Verse 2]
Without a warning, you broke my heart
Taken it baby, torn it apart
And you left me standing, in a dark clime
Said your love for me was dyin'
So come on baby, I'm on my knees

(Post-chorus)
Well I get a little lonely in the middle of the night



[Verse 1]
Red and white, blue suede shoes
I'm Uncle Sam, how do you do?
Give me five, I'm still alive
Ain't no luck, I learned to duck
Check my pulse, it don't change
Stay seventy-two come shine or rain
Wave the flag, pop the bag
Rock the boat, skin the goat

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Verse 2]
I'm Uncle Sam, that's who I am
Been hiding out in a rock and roll band
Shake the hand that shook the hand of P.T. Barnum and Charlie Chan
Shine your shoes, light your fuse
Can you use them old U.S. Blues?
I'll drink your health, share your wealth
Run your life, steal your wife

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Bridge]
Back to back chicken shack
Son of a gun, better change your act
We're all confused, what's to lose?
You can call this song the United States Blues

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my
My my my oh my my my my
Summertime done, come and gone, my



Well the first days are the hardest days
Don't you worry anymore
Cause when life looks like Easy Street
There is danger at your door

Think this through with me
Let me know your mind
Woah-ho what I want to know
Is are you kind?

It's a buck dancer's choice my friend
Better take my advice
You know all the rules by now
And the fire from the ice

Will you come with me
Won't you come with me
Woah-ho what I want to know
Will you come with me?

God damn, well, I declare
Have you seen the like
Their walls are built of cannon balls
Their motto is don't tread on me

Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come with me or go alone
He's come to take his children home

It's the same story the crow told me
It's the only one he know
Like the morning sun you come
And like the wind you go

Ain't no time to hate
Barely time to wait
Woah-ho what I want to know
Where does the time go?

I live in a silver mine
And I call it "Beggar's Tomb"
I got me a violin
And I beg you call the tune

Anybody's choice
I can hear your voice
Whoa-ho what I want to know
How does the song go?

Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide

Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home

Whoa-ho what I want to know
How does the song go?

Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide

Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home

Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh (to fade)

Songwriters:  Jerry Garcia and Robert Hunter



That girl is just a cool good looker
That baby's sweeter than raw brown sugar
Never mind 'cause the fancy took her
She says she wants to have the small head rock her

What a smile, don't it drive you insane, my baby
Drive a mile, just to ride back again, baby, won't you rock it tonight?

And when she's in the mood
When she needs that loving groove
When she wants it rude
She grooves with mista bone
If she's in the mood
If she hits that loving groove
When she's getting rude
She grooves with mista bone

Just take it like a sweet injection
Just a token of my affection
Another night we'll take another direction
I'm going to play you like a rhythm section

What style, let me see that again, my baby
Drive a mile, just to ride you again, baby, won't you rock it tonight?

And when she's in the groove
When she needs that loving mood
When she wants it rude
She grooves with mista bone
When she's in the mood
When she hits that loving groove
When she's getting rude
She grooves with mista bone

When she's in the mood
When she needs that loving groove
When she wants it rude
She grooves with mista bone
When she's in the mood
When she hits that loving groove
When she's getting rude
She grooves with mista bone



[Hook](x2)
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I made mistakes but I'm just man enough to say
There's no turning back now
There's no turning back now

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Tequila glasses, shots to the head cuz some memories they need assassins
Got a quarter pound of purp an eigth of gin and half my friends
Gone, Gone
Man fuck it though, not too good with fractions
Tried to do it all on my own, not too good with asking
Cuz when people give you a hand they want an audience back
But they not clapping and standing, they clapping at me let's panic
Pop pop that AK take candids
I aim for the sky, never landed
And yup
I look up up up in the mirror, I see a nigga gettin' rich off me
Hmm, and look at all these mother fuckers trynna get rich off me
But they wasn't there not when times got heavy man when things got deadly
Before my cash flow broke that levy man we ain't have no heat in that broke ass Chevy
Coming from a city where dreams get shredded, I'm goin off credit, these niggas need debit
Made mistakes but they made me what I am and I am what I am and I don't regret it
And I found the girl that I'd marry, the only curse
Is that I keep running into the girls that I'd fuck first

[Bridge]
But that's the, lifestyle of the big big dogs
For everything you love and want, would you trade it all?
Would you trade it all? For everything you love and more, would you trade it all?
I mean a, big house, life you never saw, for everything you want and love, would you trade it all?
Would you trade it all?
For everything you know, are you down to let it go?

Fuck nah
Trynna make it out a city where niggas don't make it out
And if you do they want the blueprint so they can try and trace it out
They got that work, and thank God for yay
Signed to G.O.O.D, thank God for Ye
Before it's all said and done the one thing that I gotta say is

[Hook](x2)

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Man I miss my grandma, she ain't passed away or nothin I'm just busy on camera
I love her, I love her, I should call her up and tell her
Give her some flowers, while she can still smell em
While she can still smell em, If you love somebody please tell em
I swear if you had 24 hours tell me who or what you'd do
Would you spend it all with your fam or would you get high with your crew?
Would you go back to your old girl and let her know that it's true?
Would you go back to your old boss and piss all over his shoes?
Would you, try and make the news? Would you get paid? Would you try to pay your dues?
Would you step it up or would you try and change shoes? Do you believe in karma or living for tomorrow?
Would you, hit the bar and go binging? Would you, steal a car, Mercedez Benz? and
Would you die alone, would you die independent? Or would have your friends right there in attendance
When it's all finished
Guess that depends on how you live
Just pray that all of your wrongs don't overshadow all that you did

[Bridge]
But that's the, lifestyle of the big big dogs
For everything you love and want, would you trade it all?
Would you trade it all? For everything you love and more, would you trade it all?
I mean a, big house, life you never saw, for everything you want and love, would you trade it all?
Would you trade it all?
For everything you know, are you down to let it go?

[Hook]x2



[Verse 1]
Sweet little baby, you don't have to go
Little baby, tell me you won't go
We'd be so good together if we had the time
Being alone is a nowhere state of mind

[Verse 2]
Loving ain't no crime, oh no
I see your man ain't here, he don't care
The way of the night has gone and we'll move on
Got to find a way to face another day

[Verse 3]
I search the world for someone I'll never find
Someone who ain't the hurting kind
If you stay the night, oh yeah
We'll make the wrong seem right

[Verse 2: Video Version]
Oooh I know this loves' no crime, oh no
I will find the time to change your mind
Oooh and if you stay the night, hold me tight
We'll make the wrong seem right


[Chorus]
So come on now
Rock me, rock me, roll me through the night
Rock me, rock me, roll me through the night
Rock me, rock me, roll me through the night
We'll burn in love tonight

[Verse 3]
Sweet little baby, oh don't you go
You ain't so innocent, I know
I know your heart's like mine, oh yeah
And I will find the time to make you mine
And if your love goes bad, if it makes you sad
But I'll be back for more at your door

[Chorus]
Rock me, rock me, roll me through the night
Rock me, rock me, roll me through the night
Rock me, rock me, roll me through the night
Before the morning light, we'll burn with love tonight
Burn with love tonight

[Instrumental]

[End Chorus]
And when your man don't care, I will be there
Still be loving real good love, so baby now
Rock me, rock me, roll me through the night
Rock me, come on, rock me, roll me through the night
Rock me, rock me, roll me through the night
There's no wrong or right we'll burn with love
Rock me, rock me, roll me through the night
Rock me, come on, rock me, roll me through the night
Rock me, rock me, roll me through the night
There's nothing left to do but make sweet love to you
Come on and rock me



Sipping down shouting about yeah we used to shake it out
Those days now I remember when anything was all right
Someone had my video blasting through the radio
Neighbours screaming out, "What the hell's going on here?"

We were already gone with a whole lot to go
When the police showed I told them, "Kiss my arse"
So young living to die and I was on my own
Two wrongs making a right I was rolling stoned

Rich is building houses Gary's doing hard time
Jamie's in the desert and Brently's bought a gun
I saw an old photograph all that I could do was laugh
And scratch my head in wonder where did all the days go?

We were already gone with nowhere to go oh no
I was singing my songs with a heart and soul
So young I was living to die I was rolling stoned
Two wrongs making a right I was rolling stoned

It's a wonder I'm alive can't believe I ever made it through that ride
Rocking all over the night I was rolling stoned
So young I was living to die I was rolling stoned
Two wrongs making a right I was rolling stoned
Damn good to be alive wonder how I ever managed to survive
Rocking all over the night I was rolling stoned
Stoned stoned stoned

Sipping down shouting about yeah we used to shake it out
Rich is building houses Gary's doing hard time
Brently bought a gun where did all the days go?
Rolling stoned I was rolling stoned



[Verse 1]
I wake in the night
To find you on my mind
Deep in a dream you'll always be
Till the end of time

[Verse 2]
I look in your eyes they touch my soul
My love is hard to hide
I'm never alone when we're apart
I feel you by my side

[Pre-Chorus]
And here in my heart
Where no one else will ever be
I know who you are
So lock the door and throw away the key

[Chorus]
Save all your love
Save your love for me
When I'm alone at night
You're all I see

[Verse 3]
I wake from a dream
And see you by my side
How could I belong to someone else
When holding you feels so right?

[Pre-Chorus]
And here in my heart
Where no one else will ever be
We've made it so far
So lock the door and throw away the key

[Chorus]
Save all your love
Save your love for me
When I'm alone at night
You're all I see

Save all your love
Save your love for me
Don't turn your back on me
You're all I see

I know who you are
We've come so far
So baby stay with me

Save all your love
Save your love for me
Don't turn your back on me
You're all I need

Save your love
Save your love
Save all your love
Save all your love
Save your love
Baby save all your love
Save all your love



[Verse 1]
Do you have the time to listen to me whine?
About nothing and everything all at once
I am one of those melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone, no doubt about it

[Hook]
Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up, I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid or am I just stoned?

[Verse 2]
I went to a shrink to analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down
I went to a whore, he said my life's a bore
Just quit my whining, ‘cause it's bringing her down

[Hook]
Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up, I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid or am I just dumb?

[Bridge]
Grasping to control, so I better hold on

[Hook]
Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up, I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid or am I just stoned?



[Verse 1]
I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me, and I walk alone
I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

[Hook]
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

[Verse 2]
I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the border line
Of the edge and where I walk alone
Read between the lines
What's fucked up, and everything's all right
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

[Hook]
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk a-

[Hook]
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

[Acoustic Intro]

[Verse 1]
Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test, and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time

[Hook]
It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

[Verse 2]
So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth it was worth all the while

[Hook]
It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

[Violin Break]

[Hook]
It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life
It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I sit around and watch the tube, but nothin's on
I change the channels for an hour or two
Twiddle my thumbs just for a bit
I'm sick of all the same old shit
In a house with unlocked doors
And I'm fuckin' lazy

[Hook]
Bite my lip and close my eyes, take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored, I'm going blind and I smell like shit

[Verse 2]
Peel me off this Velcro seat and get me moving
I sure as hell can't do it by myself
I'm feeling like a dog in heat
Barred indoors from the summer street
I locked the door to my own cell
And I lost the key

[Hook]
Bite my lip and close my eyes, take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored, I'm going blind and I smell like shit

[Bridge]
I got no motivation, where is my motivation?
No time for motivation, smoking my inspiration

[Verse 3]
I sit around and watch the phone, but no one's calling
Call me pathetic, call me what you will
My mother says to get a job, but she don't like the one she's got
When masturbation's lost its fun, you're fucking lonely

[Hook - Variation]
Bite my lip and close my eyes, take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored, I'm going blind
And loneliness has to suffice

Bite my lip and close my eyes, I'm trippin' away to paradise
Some say quit or I'll go blind, but that's just a myth



[Verse 1]
I heard you crying loud
All the way across town
You've been searching for that someone
And it's me out on the prowl
As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself
Well, don't get lonely now
And dry your whining eyes
I'm just roamin' for the moment
Sleazin' my back yard, so don't get so uptight
You been thinking about ditching me

[Chorus]
No time to search the world around
‘Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

[Verse 2]
I heard it all before
So don't knock down my door
I'm a loser and a user
So I don't need no accuser
To try and slag me down
Because I know you're right
So go do what you like
Make sure you do it wise
You may find out that your self-doubt
Means nothing was ever there
You can't go forcing something
If it's just not right

[Chorus]
No time to search the world around
‘Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

[Outro]
No time to search the world around
‘Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around
When I come around
When I come around
When I come around



We had broken up for good just an hour before
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah
And now I'm staring at the bodies as they're dancing 'cross the floor
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah
And then the band slowed the tempo and the music took me down
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah
It was the same old song, with a melancholy sound
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah

They don't write 'em like that anymore
They just don't write 'em like that anymore

We'd been living together for a million years
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah
But now it feels so strange out in the atmospheres
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah
And then the jukebox plays a song I used to know
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah
And now I'm staring at the bodies as they're dancing so slow
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah

They don't write 'em like that anymore
They don't write 'em like that anymore
Oh

Hey
Now I wind up staring at an empty glass
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah
'Cause it's so easy to say that you'll forget your past
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah

They don't write 'em like that anymore, no
They just don't write 'em like that anymore
They don't write 'em like that anymore
They just don't write 'em like that anymore
They just don't, no, they don't
No, no, uh-uh



No, I'm no angel
No, I'm no stranger to the streets
I've got my label
So I won't crumble at your feet

And I know, baby
So I got scars upon my cheek
And I'm not crazy
Come on and love me, baby

So you found me hard to handle
Well, I'm easier to hold
So you like my spurs that jingle
And never leave you cold
So I might steal your diamonds
I'll bring you back some gold
I'm no angel, mmm

No, I'm no angel
No, I'm no stranger to the dark
Let me rock your cradle
Let me start a fire with your spark

Oh, come on, baby
Come and let me show you my tattoo
Let me drive you crazy
Come on and love me, baby

So you don't give a darn about me
I'll never treat you bad
I won't ever lift a hand to hurt you
And I'll always leave you glad
So I might steal your diamonds
I'll bring you back some gold
I'm no angel

No, I'm no angel
No, I'm no stranger to the dark
Let me rock your cradle
Let me start a fire in your heart

Oh, come on, baby
Come and let me show you my tattoo
Let me drive you crazy
Come on and love me, baby

Come on, baby
Drive me crazy
Drive me crazy
Come on, baby

Come on, baby
Oh, come on, baby



[Chorus 1]
American woman, stay away from me
American woman, mama let me be

[Verse 1]
Don't come hanging around my door
I don't want to see your face no more
I got more important things to do
Than spend my time growing old with you

[Chorus 2]
Now woman, stay away
American woman, listen what I say

[Chorus 3]
American woman, get away from me
American woman, mama let me be

[Verse 2]
Don't come knocking around my door
I don't wanna see your shadow no more
Colored lights can hypnotize
Sparkle someone else's eyes

[Chorus 4]
Now woman, get away
American woman, listen what I say

[Chorus 5]
American woman, said get away from me
American woman, listen what I say

[Verse 3]
Don't come hanging around my door
Don't wanna see your face no more
I don't need your war machines
I don't need your ghetto scenes
Colored lights can hypnotize
Sparkle someone else's eyes

[Chorus 4]
Now woman, get away
American woman, listen what I say

[Chorus 1]
American woman, stay away from me
American woman, mama let me be

[Bridge]
I gotta go, I gotta get away
Baby, I gotta go, I wanna fly away
I'm gonna leave you, woman
I'm gonna leave you, woman
I'm gonna leave you, woman
I'm gonna leave you, woman
A-bye-bye, a-bye-bye
Bye-bye, bye-bye

[Outro]
(American woman) You're no good for me and I'm no good for you
(American woman) I look you right straight in the eye and tell you what I'm gonna do
(American woman) I'm going to leave you woman, you know I got to go
(American woman) I'm going to leave you woman, I got to go
(American woman) I got to go
I gotta go, American woman, yeah



[Verse]
Friends of mine don't have the time for food or wine
Just money is on their minds
Life is sweet on a one-way street
They're indiscreet and funny, they'll never meet
B-bay, b-bay, b-bay, b-bay, bay, baby
I got to get a two-ton truck [x4]
I got to do it to a duck on a two-ton truck
And fade away like Ron Rene
Alright, alright
You got the magical mystery tour [x4]
And Kurt is the Walrus
And Kurt is the Walrus
And the Walrus does funny things to the veins in his left arm
Alright
And Michael is now a father, alright
And Michael is now a proud father, alright
And my good friend Michael is now a proud father
And Michael is now a father, alright
And that means Michael's wife is a mother, alright
Up the thirteen steps of the gallows
Walked the condemned man
And time passes very quickly when death is near
After having completed the first step
The condemned man knew there were but twelve left
Before he would meet death and his soul would leave his body
And after having completed the thirteen steps
The condemned man was met by a giant cloaked figure
And with a quick flick of the wrist, the man was dead
And his soul left his body and went down, down, down
To a place we laughingly refer to as hell
But none of us will ever go there
Because we're all far too groovy
The man's body was left to rot on the gallows
And a great multitude of black birds came
And picked the man's corpse apart
Piece by piece, limb by limb
Until nothing remained
And his blood melted into the ground below
The gallows was made from a tree created by God
The man's blood dripped into the ground
Which was created by God
Even the giant cloaked figure which was the man's own end
Was created by God
Even the man's soul which went down was created by God
Even the black birds which picked the man's corpse apart
Were created by God
And where was God?
In Flanders Fields, the poppies grow
Between the crosses row on row
To mark the dead
To Flanders Fields, the hippies go
To smoke the poppies there below
And feed their heads
And they're all friends of mine
Each and every one of them
No better or no worse
And we'll probably end up down there together when it's all over
And that's why we say
B-bay, b-bay, b-bay, b-bay, b-baby
It's all over and it's all right



Lonely feeling deep inside
Find a corner where I can hide
Silent footsteps crowding me
Sudden darkness but I can see

No sugar tonight in my coffee
No sugar tonight in my tea
No sugar to stand beside me
No sugar to run with me

Dat'n-doo-dow dow-dat'n-doo-dow
Dat'n-doo-dow dow-dow-dow
Dat'n-doo-dow dow-dat'n-doo-dow
Dat'n-doo-dow dow

In the silence of her mind
Quiet movements where I can find
Grabbing for me with her eyes
Now I'm falling from her skies

No sugar tonight in my coffee
No sugar tonight in my tea
No sugar to stand beside me
No sugar to run with me

Dat'n-doo-dow dow-dat'n-doo-dow
Dat'n-doo-dow dow-dow-dow
Dat'n-doo-dow dow-dat'n-doo-dow
Dat'n-doo-dow dow

Jocko says "Yes" and I believe him
When we talk about the things I say
She hasn't got the faith or the guts to leave him
When they're standing in each other's way
You're tripping back now to places you've been to
You wonder what you're gonna find
You know you've been wrong but it won't be long
Before you leave 'em all far behind

Cause it's the new mother nature taking over
It's the new splendid lady come to call
It's the new mother nature taking over
She's gettin' us all
She's gettin' us all

Jocko said "No" when I came back last time
It's looking like I lost a friend
No use callin' cause the sky is fallin'
And I'm getting pretty near the end
A smoke-filled room in a corner basement
The situation must be right
A bag of goodies and a bottle of wine
We're gonna get it on right tonight

Cause it's the new mother nature taking over
It's the new splendid lady come to call
It's the new mother nature taking over
She's gettin' us all
She's gettin' us all

(Lonely feeling) Jocko says "Yes" and I believe him
(Deep inside) When we talk about the things I say
(Find a corner) She hasn't got the faith or the guts to leave him
(Where I can hide) When they're standing in each other's way
(Silent footsteps) You're tripping back now to places you've been to
(Crowding me) You wonder what you're gonna find
(Sudden darkness) You know you've been wrong and it won't be long
(But I can see) Before you leave 'em all far behind

Cause it's the new mother nature taking over
It's the new splendid lady come to call
It's the new mother nature taking over
She's gettin' us all
She's gettin' us all

Dat'n-doo-dow dow-dat'n-doo-dow
Dat'n-doo-dow dow-dow-dow
Dat'n-doo-dow dow-dat'n-doo-dow
Dat'n-doo-dow dow

Dat'n-doo-dow dow-dat'n-doo-dow
Dat'n-doo-dow dow-dow-dow
Dat'n-doo-dow dow-dat'n-doo-dow
Dat'n-doo-dow dow



No time left for you
On my way to better things
No time left for you
I'll find myself some wings
No time left for you
Distant roads are calling me
No time left for you
Mm-da, mm-da, mm-da, mm-da, mm-da

No time for a summer friend
No time for the love you send
Seasons change and so did I
You need not wonder why
You need not wonder why
There's no time left for you
No time left for you

No time left for you
On my way to better things
No time left for you
I found myself some wings
No time left for you
Distant roads are calling me
No time left for you
Mm-day, mm-gay, mm-day, mm-gay, mm-day

No time for a gentle rain
No time for my watch and chain
No time for revolving doors
No time for the killing floor
No time for the killing floor
There's no time left for you
No time left for you

No time for a summer friend
No time for the love you send
Seasons change and so did I
You need not wonder why
You need not wonder why
There's no time left for you
No time left for you

No time, no time, no time, no time
No time, no time, no time, no time

I got, got, got, got no time
I got, got, got, got no time
I got, got, got, got no time
No, no, no, no, no, no, no time

Got no time, got no time



{Intro}

These eyes, cry every night for you
These arms, long to hold you again

The hurting's on me, yeah
I will never be free, no, my baby, no no
You gave a promise to me, yeah
You broke it, and you broke it, oh no

{Hook}

These eyes, watched you bring my world to an end
This heart could not accept and pretend

The hurting's on me, yeah
I will never be free, no, no, no
You took the vow with me, yeah
And you spoke it, and you spoke it, babe

These eyes, are crying
These eyes have seen a lot of loves
But they're never gonna see another one like I had with you
These eyes, are crying
These eyes have seen a lot of loves
But they're never gonna see another one like I had with you
These eyes, are crying
These eyes have seen a lot of loves
But they're never gonna see another one like I had with you

These eyes, cry every night for you
These arms, these arms long to hold you, hold you again

These eyes, are crying
These eyes have seen a lot of loves
But their never gonna see another one like I had with you
These eyes, are crying
These eyes have seen a lot of loves
But their never gonna see another one like I had with you
These eyes, are crying

But their never gonna see another one like I had with you
These eyes, are crying

But their never gonna see another one like I had with you

Baby, baby, baby, baby

"What we've got here is failure to communicate
Some men, you just can't reach
So, you get what we had here, last week
Which is the way he wants it
Well, he gets it
And I don't like it any more than you men"

[Intro]
Look at your young men fighting
Look at your women crying
Look at your young men dying
The way they've always done before

Look at the hate we're breeding
Look at the fear we're feeding
Look at the lives we're leading
The way we've always done before

[Verse 1]
My hands are tied
The billions shift from side to side
And the wars go on with brainwashed pride
For the love of god and our human rights
And all these things are swept aside
By bloody hands time can't deny
And are washed away by your genocide
And history hides the lies of our civil wars

[Bridge 1]
D'you wear a black armband when they shot the man
Who said peace could last forever?
And in my first memories, they shot Kennedy
I went numb when I learned to see
So I never fell for Vietnam
We got the wall in D.C. to remind us all
That you can't trust freedom when it's not in your hands
When everybody's fightin' for their promised land

[Chorus]
And I don't need your civil war
It feeds the rich, while it buries the poor
Your power hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store
(Ain't that fresh?)
I don't need your civil war

[Intro Reprise]
Look at the shoes you're filling
Look at the blood we're spilling
Look at the world we're killing
The way we've always done before

Look in the doubt we've wallowed
Look at the leaders we've followed
Look at the lies we've swallowed
And I don't want to hear no more

[Verse 2]
My hands are tied
For, all I've seen has changed my mind
But still the wars go on, as the years go by
With no love of God or human rights
And all these dreams are swept aside
By bloody hands of the hypnotized
Who carry the cross of homicide
And history bears the scars of our civil wars

[Bridge 2]
We practice selective annihilation
Of mayors and government officials
For example, to create a vacuum
Then we fill that vacuum
As popular war advances
Peace is closer

[Chorus]
I don't need your civil war
It feeds the rich, while it buries the poor
Your power hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store
(Ain't that fresh?)
I don't need your civil war

[Outro]
I don't need your civil war
I don't need your civil war
Your power hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store
(Ain't that fresh?)
I don't need your civil war

I don't need one more war
I don't need one more war

What's so civil about war anyway?



[Verse 1]
Talk to me softly
There's something in your eyes
Don't hang your head in sorrow
And please don't cry
I know how you feel inside, I've
I've been there before
Something is changing inside you
And don't you know?

[Chorus]
Don't you cry tonight
I still love you, baby
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
There's a heaven above you, baby
And don't you cry tonight

[Verse 2]
Give me a whisper
And give me a sigh
Give me a kiss before you tell me goodbye
Don't you take it so hard now
And please don't take it so bad
I'll still be thinking of you
And the times we had, baby

[Chorus]
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
There's a heaven above you, baby
And don't you cry tonight

[Verse 3]
And please remember
That I never lied
And please remember
How I felt inside now, honey
You got to make it your own way
But you'll be alright now, sugar
You'll feel better tomorrow
Come the morning light, now, baby

[Chorus]
And don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
There's a heaven above you, baby
And don't you cry
Don't you ever cry
Don't you cry tonight
Baby, maybe someday
Don't you cry
Don't you ever cry
Don't you cry tonight



[Verse 1]
When you were young and your heart was an open book
You used to say live and let live
(You know you did, you know you did, you know you did)
But if this ever changing world in which we're living
Makes you give in and cry

[Chorus]
Say live and let die
(Live and let die)
Live and let die
(Live and let die)

[Verse 2]
What does it matter to you?
When you got a job to do
You got to do it well
You got to give the other fellow hell

[Verse 1]
You used to say live and let live
(You know you did, you know you did, you know you did)
But if this ever changing world in which we're living
Makes you give in and cry

[Chorus]
Say live and let die
(Live and let die)
Live and let die
(Live and let die)



[Verse 1]
I get up around seven
Get out of bed around nine
And I don't worry about nothing, no
Because worrying's a waste of my... time

The show usually starts around seven
We go on stage around nine
Get on the bus about eleven
Sipping a drink and feeling fine

[Chorus]
We've been dancing with Mr. Brownstone
He's been knocking
He won't leave me alone
No, no, no, he won't leave me alone

I used to do a little but a little wouldn't do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep trying to get a little better
Said the little better than before
I used to do a little but a little wouldn't do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep trying to get a little better
Said the little better than before

[Chorus]
We've been dancing with Mr. Brownstone
He's been knocking
He won't leave me alone
No, no, no, he won't leave me alone

[Verse 2]
Now I get up around whenever
I used to get up on time
But that old man he's a real motherfucker
Gonna kick him on down the line

[Chorus]
We've been dancing with Mr. Brownstone
He's been knocking
He won't leave me alone
No, no, no, he won't leave me alone

[Verse 3]
Stuck it in the middle and I shot it in the middle
And it, it drove outta my mind
I should've known better, said I wish I never met her Said I
I leave it all behind Yowsa!



[Verse 1]
Your daddy works in porno
Now that mommy's not around
She used to love her heroin
But now she's underground
So you stay out late at night
And you do your coke for free
Drivin your friends crazy
With your life's insanity

[Chorus]
Well, well, well
You just can't tell
Well, well, well
My Michelle

[Verse 2]
Sowin all your wild oats
In another's luxuries
Yesterday was Tuesday
Maybe Thursday
You can sleep
But school starts
Much too early
And this hotel wasn't free
So party till your
Connection call
Honey I'll return the key

[Chorus]
Well, well, well
You just can't tell
Well, well, well m
My Michelle
Well, well, well
You never can tell
Well, well, well
My Michelle

[Verse 3]
Everyone needs love
You know that it's true
Someday you'll find someone
That'll fall in love with you
But oh the time it takes
When you're all alone
Someday you'll find someone
That you can call your own
But till then ya better

[Solo]

[Verse 4]
Now you're clean
And so discreet
I won't say a word
But most of all
This song is true
Case you haven't heard
So c'mon and
Stop your cryin
Cause we both
Know money burns
Honey don't stop tryin
An you'll get
What you deserve

[Chorus]
Well, well, well
You just can't tell
Well, well, well m
My Michelle
Well, well, well
You never can tell
Well, well, well
My Michelle
My my my Michele[x3]
Michelle



[Verse 1]
When I look into your eyes, I can see a love restrained
But darlin', when I hold you, don't you know I feel the same?

[Chorus]
'Cause nothing lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
And it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain

[Verse 2]
We've been through this such a long, long time
Just trying to kill the pain
But lovers always come and lovers always go
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today
Walking away
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
I could rest my head, just knowin' that you were mine
All mine

[Chorus]
So, if you want to love me
Then darlin', don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walking
In the cold November rain

[Refrain]
Do you need some time on your own?
Do you need some time, all alone?
Everybody needs some time on their own
Don't you know you need some time, all alone?

[Bridge]
I know it's hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you

[Solo 1]

[Refrain]
Sometimes, I need some time on my own
Sometimes, I need some time, all alone
Everybody needs some time on their own
Don't you know you need some time, all alone?

[Verse 3]
And when your fears subside, and shadows still remain
I know that you can love me, when there's no one left to blame

[Chorus]
So, never mind the darkness
We still can find a way
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
Even cold November rain

[Solo 2]

[Outro]
Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one
You're not the only one

Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one
You're not the only one

Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one
You're not the only one

Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one
You're not the only one



[Chorus] (x2)
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
(Take me home) Oh, won't you please take me home?

[Verse 1]
Just an urchin living under the street
I'm a hard case that's tough to beat
I'm your charity case, so buy me something to eat
I'll pay you at another time
Take it to the end of the line

Rags and riches, or so they say
You gotta keep pushing for the fortune and fame
You know it's, it's all a gamble, when it's just a game
You treat it like a capital crime
Everybody's doing the time

[Chorus]
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home?
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home

[Verse 2]
Strapped in the chair of the city's gas chamber
Why I'm here, I can't quite remember
The Surgeon General say's it's hazardous to breathe
I'd have another cigarette
But I can't see
Tell me who you're gonna believe

[Chorus]
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home, yeah-yeah
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home

[Solo]

[Bridge] (x4)
So far away

[Verse 3]
Captain America's been torn apart
Now, he's a court jester with a broken heart
He said, "Turn me around and take me back to the start
I must be losing my mind
Are you blind?!
I've seen it all a million times

[Outro]
I wanna go
I wanna know
Oh, won't you please take me home?
I wanna see
How good it can be
Oh, won't you please take me home?

Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
(Take me home) Oh, won't you please take me home?
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home?

Take me down (ooh yeah)
Spin me 'round
Oh, won't you please take me home?
I wanna see
How good it can be
Oh, won't you please take me home?

I wanna see
How good it can be
Oh, won't you please take me home?

Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home?
I wanna go
I wanna know
Oh, won't you please take me home?

Baby



One, two, one, two, three, four
[Verse 1]
Shed a tear cause I'm missing you
I'm still alright to smile
Girl I think bout you every day now
Was a time when I wasn't sure but you
Set my mind at ease
There is no doubt you're in my heart now

[Chorus]
Said woman take it slow and it'll work itself out fine
All we need is just a little patience
Said sugar make it slow and we'll come together fine
All we need is just a little patience
Patience

[Verse 2]
I sit here on the stairs cause I'd rather be alone
If I can't have you right now I'll wait dear
Sometimes I get so tense but I can't speed up the time
But you know love there's one more thing to consider

[Chorus]
Said woman take it slow and things will be just fine
You and I'll just use a little patience
Said sugar take the time cause the lights are shining bright
You and I've got what it takes to make it
We won't fake it, I'll never break it, cause I can't take it

[Bridge]
Little patience, yeah
Need a little patience, yeah
Just a little patience, yeah
Some more patience, yeah
Could use some patience yeah
Gotta have some
Patience yeah
All it takes is patience
Just a little patience
Is all you need

[Verse 3]
I've been walking the streets at night
Just trying to get it right
It's hard to see with so many around
You know I don't like being stuck in the crowd
And the streets don't change but maybe the names
I ain't got time for the game cause I need you
Yeah yeah yeah
Cause I need you
Ooo I need you, whoa I need you
Ooh all this time



[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I'd stare too long, I'd probably break down and cry

[Chorus]
Sweet child o' mine
Sweet love of mine

[Verse 2]
She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain
To quietly pass me by

[Chorus]
Sweet child o' mine
Sweet love of mine

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Sweet child o' mine
Sweet love of mine

[Chorus]
Sweet child o' mine
Sweet love of mine

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Sweet child
Where do we go now?
Aj, aj, aj aj, aj...
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Sweet child
Sweet child o' mine



[Chorus]
I used to love her
But I had to kill her
I used to love her
But I had to kill her
I had to put her
Six feet under
And I can still hear her complain

[Verse 1]
I used to love her
But I had to kill her
I used to love her
But I had to kill her
I knew I would miss her
So I had to keep her
She's buried right
In my backyard

[Verse 2]
I used to love her
But I had to kill her
I used to love her
But I had to kill her
She bitched so much
She drove me nuts
And now I am happier this way
Oh oh yeah
Take it for
What it is

[Chorus]
I used to love her
But I had to kill her
I used to love her
But I had to kill her
I had to put her
Six feet under
And I can still hear her complain



[Verse 1]
Welcome to the jungle, we got fun and games
We got everything you want, honey, we know the names
We are the people that can find whatever you may need
If you got the money, honey, we got your disease

[Chorus]
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your shun n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n knees, knees
I wanna watch you bleed

[Verse 2]
Welcome to the jungle, we take it day by day
If you want it you're going to bleed, but it's the price you pay
And you're a very sexy girl, very hard to please
You can taste the bright lights, but you won't get there for free
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Feel my, my, my serpentine, I want to hear you scream

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Welcome to the jungle, it gets worse here everyday
You learn to live like an animal in the jungle where we play
If you got a hunger for what you see, you'll take it eventually
You can have anything you want, but you better not take it from me

[Chorus]
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your shun n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n knees, knees
I wanna watch you bleed

[Bridge]
And when you're high you never
Ever want to come down
So down, so down, so down yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
You know where you are? You're in the jungle, baby
You're going to die, in the jungle

[Chorus]
Welcome to the jungle, watch it bring you to your knees, knees
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Feel my, my, my serpentine
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your knees, knees
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your, it's going to bring you down



[Verse 1]
I'm a cold heartbreaker, fit to burn
And I'll rip your heart in two
And I'll leave you lying on the bed
I'll be out the door before you wake
It's nothing new to you
'Cause I think we've seen that movie, too

[Chorus]
'Cause you could be mine
But you're way out of line
With your bitch slap rapping and your cocaine tongue
You get nothing done
I said, you could be mine

[Verse 2]
Now, holidays come, and then they go
It's nothing new, today
Collect another memory
When I come home, late at night
Don't ask me where I've been
Just count your stars I'm home again

[Chorus]
'Cause you could be mine
But you're way out of line
With your bitch slap rapping and your cocaine tongue
You get nothing done
I said, you could be mine

You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine, mine, mine ,mine

[Bridge]
You've gone sketching too many times
Why don't you give it a rest?
Why must you find another reason to cry?

[Solo]

[Bridge 2]
Well, you're breaking down my back and I've been racking out my brain
It don't matter how we make it, 'cause it always ends the same
You can push it for more mileage, but your flaps are wearing thin
And I could sleep on it until morning, but this nightmare never ends
Don't forget to call my lawyers with ridiculous demands
An' you can take the pity so far, but it's more than I can stand
Cause this couch-trip's getting older
Tell me how long has it been?
'Cause 5 years is forever, and you haven't grown up yet

[Chorus]
You could be mine
But you're way out of line
With your bitch slap rappin' and your cocaine tongue
You get nothing done
I said, you could be mine
You should be
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
Yeah



[Verse 1]
My child arrived just the other day
He came to the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
And he was talkin' 'fore I knew it, and as he grew
He'd say "I'm gonna be like you, Dad
You know I'm gonna be like you"

[Chorus]
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
When you comin' home, Dad
I don't know when, but we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then

[Verse 2]
My son turned ten just the other day
He said, "Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on let's play
Can you teach me to throw", I said "Not today
I got a lot to do", he said, "That's ok
And he walked away but his smile never dimmed
And said, "I'm gonna be like him, yeah
You know I'm gonna be like him"

[Chorus]
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
When you comin' home, Dad
I don't know when, but we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then

[Verse 3]
Well, he came from college just the other day
So much like a man I just had to say
"Son, I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while"
He shook his head and said with a smile
"What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys
See you later, can I have them please"

[Chorus]
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
When you comin' home son
I don't know when, but we'll get together then, Dad
You know we'll have a good time then

[Verse 4]
I've long since retired, my son's moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said, "I'd like to see you if you don't mind"
He said, "I'd love to, Dad, if I can find the time
You see my new job's a hassle and kids have the flu
But it's sure nice talking to you, Dad
It's been sure nice talking to you"
And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He'd grown up just like me
My boy was just like me

[Chorus]
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
When you comin' home son
I don't know when, but we'll get together then, Dad
We're gonna have a good time then

You can climb a mountain
You can swim the sea
You can jump into the fire
But you'll never be free

You can shake me up
Or I can break you down
Whoa-o-o-o-, whoa-o-o-o-

We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy

We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy

We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy

We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy

You can jump into the fire
You can jump into the fire
You can jump into the fire
You can jump into the fire



Did you see any action?
Did you make any friends?
Would you like some affection
Before I leave again?

I've been walking behind you
Since you've been able to see
There's never been any reason
For you to think about me

Did you have any bad dreams?
Did you break any glass?
Would you be my companion?
Is there even a chance?

You've been talking in circles
Since I've been able to cry
There's never been any reason
For ever telling me why, yeah, yeah

Save my life, I'm going down for the last time
Woman with the sweet lovin', better than a white line
Bring a good feeling ain't had in such a long time
Save my life, I'm going down for the last time

Have you ever been lonely? Do you have any fun?
Do you ever think of me? I'm just no one, yeah
You never give me no answer, you never tell me the truth
There's never been any reason
For me to think about you
There's never been any reason
There's never been any reason, yeah
There's never been any reason

Save my life, I'm going down for the last time
Woman with the sweet lovin', better than a white line
Don't you know she could bring a good feeling
Ain't had in such a long time?
Save my life, I'm going down for the last time
Whoa
Save my life, I'm going down for the last time
Save my life, I'm going down for the last time
Save my life, I'm going down for the last time
Save my life, I'm going down for the last time
Save my life, I'm going down for the last time



It was a rainy night
When he came into sight
Standing by the road
With no umbrella, no coat

So I pulled up along side
And I offered him a ride
He accepted with a smile
So we drove for a while

I didn't ask him his name
This lonely boy in the rain
Fate, tell me it's right
Is this love at first sight?
Please don't make it wrong
Just stay for a night

All I wanna do is make love to you
Say you will, you want me too
All I wanna do is make love to you
I got loving arms to hold onto

So we found this hotel
It was a place I knew well
We made magic that night
Oh, he did everything right

He brought the woman out of me
So many times, easily
And in the morning, when he woke
All I left him was a note

I told him I am the flower
You are the seed
We walked in the garden
We planted a tree

Don't try to find me
Please don't you dare
Just live in my memory
You'll always be there

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
I got loving arms to hold onto

Whoa, oh, we made love
Love like strangers
All night long
We made love

Then it happened one day
We came 'round the same way
You can imagine his surprise
When he saw his own eyes

I said, "Please, please understand
I'm in love with another man
And what he couldn't give me, oh, whoa
Was the one little thing that you can"

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
Come on, say you will, you want me too

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
Say you will, baby, want me too

All night long, all night long
All night long, all night long

All I wanna do, all I wanna do
All I wanna do, all I wanna do

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew



[Verse 1]
I hear the ticking of the clock
I'm lying here the room's pitch dark
I wonder where you are tonight
No answer on the telephone
And the night goes by so very slow
Oh, I hope that it won't end though
Alone

[Chorus]
Till now I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?

[Verse 2]
You don't know how long I have wanted
To touch your lips and hold you tight, oh
You don't know how long I have waited
And I was gonna tell you tonight
But the secret is still my own
And my love for you is still unknown
Alone

[Chorus]
Till now I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?

[Outro]
How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?
Alone, alone



[Intro]

[Verse 1]
So this ain't the end, I saw you again today
I had to turn my heart away
You smiled like the Sun, kisses for everyone
And tales, it never fails!

[Chorus]
You lying so low in the weeds
Bet you gonna ambush me
You'd have me down, down, down, down to my knees
Now wouldn't you, Barracuda?

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Back over time when we were all trying for free
You met the porpoise and me
No right no wrong you're selling a song, a name
Whisper game

[Chorus]
And if the real thing don't do the trick
You better make up something quick
You gonna burn, burn, burn, burn burn to the wick
Ooh, Barracuda?

[Bridge]
"Sell me sell you" the porpoise said
Dive down deep to save my head
You, I think you got the blues too

All that night and all the next
Swam without looking back
Made for the western pools, silly, silly fools!

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
If the real thing don't do the trick, no
You better make up something quick
You gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn it to the wick

Bara-Barracuda

[Outro]



Got to be you reading my letter
Not your hired hand
I don't know how to say it no better
I love you and the band
Never heard rockin' like you could
Or Howlin' like you can
It gets me thinking of 'Johnny B. Goode'
But you know you ain't no man

When I heard you play I knew your
Name should be changed
We're all dog panicked and you are to blame
Everybody ought to call you
Bebe Le Strange
You look so insane
We gave you a name
Bebe Le Strange

I wish I knew what you're really like
A touch so shy and fine
But the way you move with that guitar
Just gives me other signs
Here's my number give me a sign
Call me back if this gets through
I said Bebe, Bebe, Bebe, Bebe
I'd never say no to you

When I heard your song I knew your
Name should be changed
Everybody ought to call you
Bebe Le Strange
Under my skin you've got my mind rearranged
You're so insane, Bebe's so strange
Bebe Le Strange



[Verse 1]
If we still have time, we might still get by
Every time I think about it, I wanna cry
With bombs and the devil, and the kids keep comin'
No way to breathe easy, no time to be young

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But I tell myself that I was doin' all right
There's nothin' left to do at night

[Chorus]
But to go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you

[Verse 2]
My love is the evenin' breeze touchin' your skin
The gentle, sweet singin' of leaves in the wind
The whisper that calls after you in the night
And kisses your ear in the early moonlight

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And you don't need to wonder, you're doing fine
My love, the pleasure's mine

[Chorus]
Let me go crazy on ya
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you

[Bridge]
Wild man's world is cryin' in pain
What you gonna do when everybody's insane
So afraid of one who's so afraid of you
What you gonna do?
Ah-ah-ah-ah

[Chorus]
Crazy on ya
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you

[Verse 3]
I was a willow last night in my dream
I bent down over a clear running stream
I sang you the song that I heard up above
And you kept me alive with your sweet flowing love

[Chorus]
Crazy
Yeah, crazy on ya
Let me go crazy, crazy on you
Oh yeah
Crazy on ya
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you

[Guitar Solo]

[Build]
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)

[Chorus]
Crazy
Yeah, crazy on ya
Let me go crazy, crazy on you

Mozart - Symphony No. 40 in G Minor, Eine Kleine Nachtmusik (The Israeel Philharmonic Orchestra)
Mozart - Sinfonia Concertante (The Czech Philharmonic Orchestra



Heading out this morning, into the sun
Riding on the diamond waves, little darlin' one
Warm wind caress her, her lover it seems
Oh Annie, dreamboat Annie, little ship of dreams
Oh Annie, dreamboat Annie, little ship of dreams

Going down the city sidewalk, alone in the crowd
No one knows the lonely one whose head's in the clouds
Sad faces painted over with those magazine smiles
Heading out to somewhere, won't be back for a while



I'm the one who can please you
Ain't that what you said
You seemed so alone
I guess I was easily led

I showed you my love
But I guess that it went to your head
When you were hungry
I brought you your breakfast in bed

Even it up, even it up, even it up
Even it up, even it up, even it up
A good man pays his debt
But you ain't paid yours yet
Even it
Even it up

I took you down over the tracks when
You wanted some sin
I brought you satin and herbs from
The places I been
Now something tells me you're
Going to use me again
You think you can lay down the how and
The where and the when

Even it up, even it up, even it up
Even it up, even it up, even it up
I don't want to bum it all
But this axe she got to fall
Even it
Even it up



The doctor said come back again next week, I think that you need me
All she did was cry
She wanted to die
Doctor when can you see me?
There's a guy out there! seems like he's everywhere!
It just ain't fair!

Heartless-heartless! never never out of control
Heartless-heartless! you keep on sinin' in the name of rock and roll
Heartless-heartless! he thinks it's so cool to be cold
Never realize the way love dies when you crucify it's soul

Late night in the penthouse room, the fire is burning
Shadows are warm, laying in his arms she answers his yearning
Her eyes are filled with sand

Heartless-heartless! never out of control
Heartless-heartless! sin in the name of rock and roll
Heartless-heartless! he thinks it's so cool to be cold
Never realize the way love dies when you crucify it's soul



Wake me up with laughter
Wrap me in your arms
This ain't no morning after
Never been so warm
It didn't take so long
For us to feel this way
Can a good thing last
Longer than a day?

Where do we take it now
Now that we caught fire?
Will something greater grow
Out of this desire?
Should I drop my guard
At the risk of being used?
But the way you do those things to me
How can I refuse?

I could get addicted
To your energy
The way you take me over
Pulling on me
Our hearts beat together
Our timing is the same
Can I trust my feelings
Save myself the pain?

Where do we take it now
Now that we caught fire?
Will something greater grow
Out of this desire?
Should I drop my guard
At the risk of being used?
But the way you do those things to me
How can I refuse?

We could share they mystery
Spare ourselves the misery
Discover it again every day
We could take love all the way

Where do we take it now
Now that we caught fire?
Will something greater grow
Out of this desire?
Should I drop my guard
At the risk of being used?
But the way you do those things to me
How can I refuse?



Caught you in the act, can't put up with that
Messing where you shouldn't be
I wanna hear you say you're sorry
'Cuz nobody takes advantage of me
You're missing the mark, shooting in the dark
I'm pulling the wool from my eyes
Baby, don't push me further
It's gonna hurt you if it happens twice

If looks could kill
You'd be lying on the floor
You'd be begging me, please, please
Baby don't hurt me no more
If looks could kill
You'd be reeling from the pain
And you'd never lie again
If looks could kill

Living on the edge, hanging by a thread
I'm watching every move you make
You don't want to see my anger
So don't you make another mistake
Love is on the line, I ain't about to be kind
That's a promise and a threat
If I was you, I'd really cool it
Or risk a night you will never forget

If looks could kill
You'd be lying on the floor
You'd be begging me, please, please
Baby don't hurt me no more
If looks could kill
You'd be reeling from the pain
And you'd never lie again
If looks could kill

I was a fool to believe in you
A sucker for every line
I'm a little less blind than I was before
I can see right through your design

If looks could kill
You'd be lying on the floor
You'd be begging me, please, please
Baby don't hurt me no more
If looks could kill
You'd be reeling from the pain
And you'd never lie again
If looks could kill

You'd be lying on the floor
You'd be begging me, please, please
Baby don't hurt me no more
If looks could kill
You'd be reeling from the pain
And you'd never lie again
If looks could kill
If looks could kill



Out of the street - get on home
Tail shaking filly running on her own
They say she got loose on the night she was born
Cranking it up in a school zone

'Kick it out - kick it out!' she said
'Kick out your motor and drive
While you're still alive - kick it out!'

Sitting in a bar in a seaside town
Sweet little love getting high getting down
Sailors see her running along the beach
Laugh and jump out of reach

Wild music blowing in her mane
She needs a bareback rider won't give her no pain
A hard racy game of give and take
Leaves them dazed- half crazed - in her wake

'Kick it out - kick it out!' she said
'Kick out your motor and drive
While you're still alive - kick it out!'



You'd rather have wine than gin
And only the finest by your skin
Always running after time
Catching your fancy with rhymes
Shining on the front page again

Now you're hot on the presses today
Little queen
Making your passion play
Little queen
Nobody knows your melancholy mind
Little queen

Away from the sellers, the papers said
Your crown was tight and heavy on your head
But still you danced and you sang
All night the telephone rang
And music kept on playing from your pen

Now you're hot on the presses today
Little queen
Making your passion play
Little queen
Nobody knows your melancholy mind
Little queen, yeah
Little queen, yeah
Little queen, yeah
Little queen, ooh

You better shine, you better shine, you know
You better shine, shine shine tonight, oh
(Raining) He knows your soul ain't free
(Raining) Oh, and he feels you, little queen, yeah

(Raining) Oh, I know
(Raining) I see you, I see you raining
(Raining) He knows you're raining
(Raining) Oh, yeah

Now you're slipping away with your gypsy band
And you're hot on your music and playing a winning hand
You were standing in the line
Thinking how you moved his mind
And feeling like he held you in his hand

And you're hot on the presses today
Little queen
Making your passion play
Little queen
Nobody knows your melancholy mind
Little queen, yeah
Little queen, yeah
Little queen, yeah
Little queen

Magazine
Little queen, yeah
Ooh, oh, no, no, no, little queen
Oh, ooh, no, no, no, little queen



The sky was dark this morning
When I raised my head
I stood at the window- darkness was my bane

Suddenly a sunbeam arch
Thrilled me to my weary heart
It was the prettiest thing I'd ever seen

I knew I had to keep my love
Keep my love alive
Keep my love- keep my love alive

Baby I want you to roll me
Hold me in your love
No more habits, promises and jive

Ever since I was a baby girl
Wanted one thing most in this world
It was to keep my love- keep my love alive

Yeah, got to keep my love- keep my love alive
Keep my love- keep my love alive

[Instrumental]

You're up there under the spotlight
Your silver trophy shines
With all you got, my lord! you must get high
You need a whole lot more than money
You need more than to survive
You gotta keep your love
Keep your love alive!

Oo, you got to keep your love, keep your love alive
Keep your love now, keep it alive



Cold, late night so long ago
When I was not so strong you know
A pretty man came to me
Never seen eyes so blue
You know, I could not run away it seemed
We'd seen each other in a dream
Seemed like he knew me....he looked right through me....yeah

"Come on home, girl" he said with a smile
"you don't have to love me yet, let's get high awhile
But try to understand...try to understand
Try, try, try to understand....I'm a magic man"

Winter nights we sang in tune
Played inside the months of moon
"Never think of never..let this spell last forever"
Well, summer lover passed to fall
Tried to realize it all
Mama says she's worried..growing up in a hurry

"Come on home, girl" Mama cried on the phone
"Too soon to lose my baby yet, my girl should be at home"
But try to understand....try to understand
Try, try, try to understand..he's a magic man, Mama...ah...he's a magic man

"Come on home, girl" he said with a smile
"I cast my spell of love on you, a woman from a child"
But try to understand...try to understand..
Oh...oh....try, try to understand
Try, try, try to understand....
He's a magic man....oh....he's got the magic hands

(solos) OoooOooo's over top

"Come on home, girl" he said with a smile
"You don't have to love me yet, let's get high awhile"
But try to understand....try to understand
Try, try, try to understand...he's a magic man.....yeah...oh......



No wind when I took the watch
My ship was still and waiting
I lay on that mirrored sky
A restless sailor waiting
I closed my eyes said the
Words of will for the gentle
Breathing that moves the seas
Make my sails fill

Whisper waves cloud the glass
Awake at last like a lover
It rushed around me talking sweet
Roll over, roll over, roll over
And in my ear he blew his name
It sound so strange but I heard it plain
Mistral, mistral wind

I have always held the wheel but
I let the wind steal my power
Spin me 'round lose my course
Nights run by like hours
Well, it would show me the way
To the deepest mountains
Too high and beautiful to be
Mistral, mistral wind

All the hours on the watch
I wait for that breeze to move me
And blow me back to that place
Magic space all through me
And I sigh your name
Across the empty water
You made a crazy dreamer out of me
Mistral, mistral, mistral, mistral
Mistral, mistral



Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa

Hey baby, I'm talkin' to you
Stop yourself and listen
Some things you can never, never choose
Even if you try, yeah

You're banging your head again
Cause somebody won't let you in
One chance, one love
Your chance to let me know

We can't go on
Just running away
If we stay any longer
We will surely never get away

Whoa, oh, anything you want we can make it happen
Stand up and turn around
Never let them shoot us down
Never, never, never
Never run away

Hey baby you know it's true
Why you bother lying
When you know that you want it to
Don't you dare deny me

Walk those legs right over here
Give me what I'm dying for
One chance, one love
Hold me down, let me go

We can't go on
Just running away
If we wait any longer
We will surely never get away

Whoa, oh, anything you want we can make it happen
Stand up and turn around
Never let them shoot us down

Never, never (no), never
Never run away

Never, no never, never
Never run away

Hey baby, I'm talkin' to you
Stop yourself and listen
Some things you can never choose
Even if you try, yeah

You're banging your head again
Cause somebody won't let you in
One chance, one love
Your chance to let me know

We can't go on just running away
If we stay any longer
We will surely never get away

Whoa, never
Whoa, never

We can't go on, never
We can't go on, never

Whoa, never
Whoa, never

We can't go on, never
We can't go on, never

Whoa, never
Whoa, never



I would walk home every evening
Through the pyramids of light
I would feed myself from silence
Wash it down with empty nights

Then your innocent distractions
Hit me so hard
My emotional reaction
Caught me off guard

It was nothin' at all (nothin' at all)
Like anything I had felt before
And it was nothin' at all (nothin' at all)
Like I thought, no, it's so much more

No one else
Has ever made me feel this way
When I asked you how you did it
You just say
It was nothin' at all

Now, I walk home every evening
And my feet are quick to move
'Cause I know my destination
Is a warm and waiting you

From our first communication
It was clear
Any thought of moderation
Would soon disappear

It was nothin' at all (nothin' at all)
Like anything I had felt before
And it was nothin' at all (nothin' at all)
Like I thought, no, it's so much more

No one else
Has ever made me feel this way
When I asked you how you did it
You just say
It was nothin' at all

Then your innocent distractions
Hit me so hard
My emotional reaction
Caught me off guard

It was nothin' at all (nothin' at all)
Like anything I had felt before
And it was nothin' at all (nothin' at all)
Like I thought, no, it's so much more

No one else
Has ever made me feel this way
When I asked you how you did it
You just say
It was nothin' at all

It was nothin' at all (nothin' at all)
Like anything I had felt before
It was nothin' at all (nothin' at all)
No, it was nothin' at all (nothin' at all)
Nothin' at all (nothin' at all)



All right!

I couldn't stop moving when it first took hold
It was a warm spring night at the old town hall
There was a group called The Jokers, they were layin' it down
'Cha know I'm never gonna lose that funky sound

Rock and roll, hoochie koo (Rock and roll, hoochie koo)
Lordy mama, light my fuse (Light my fuse)
Rock and roll, hoochie koo (Rock and roll, hoochie koo)
Truck on out and spread the news

The skeeters started buzzin' 'bout this time a year
I'm going 'round back, said she'd meet me there
We were rollin' in the grass that grows behind the barn
When my ears started ringin' like a fire alarm

Rock and roll, hoochie koo (Rock and roll, hoochie koo)
Lordy mama, light my fuse (Light my fuse)
Rock and roll, hoochie koo (Rock and roll, hoochie koo)
Truck on out and spread the news

Yeah, did somebody say keep on rockin'?
Ow!

That's right
Woo!

I hope you all know what I'm talkin' about
The way they wiggle that thing really knocks me out
I'm gettin' high all the time, hope you all are too
C'mon little closer, gonna do it to you

Rock and roll, hoochie koo (Rock and roll, hoochie koo)
Lordy mama, light my fuse (Light my fuse)
Rock and roll, hoochie koo (Rock and roll, hoochie koo)
Truck on out and spread the news

Woo!
Rock and roll, hoochie koo (Rock and roll, hoochie koo)
Lordy mama, light my fuse (Rock and roll, hoochie koo)
Rock and roll, hoochie koo (Rock and roll, hoochie koo)
Truck on out and spread the news, yeah (Rock and roll, hoochie koo)
That I'm tired of payin' dues (Rock and roll, hoochie koo)
I done said goodbye to all my blues (Rock and roll, hoochie koo)
Lordy mama, light my fuse
Ow!

Quite some time, I been sittin' it out
Didn't take no chances, I was a prisoner of doubt
I knocked down the wailin' wall, ain't no sin
Got the feel of fortune, deal me in

Comin' straight on for you
You made my mind
Now I'm stronger, now I'm comin' through
Straight on, straight on for you
Straight on for you

Now I know I got to play my hand
What the winner don't know, a gambler understands

I'll take my chances on you again and again, again

Comin' straight on for you
You made my mind
Now I'm stronger, now I'm comin' through
Straight on, straight on for you

And now I'm stronger, now I'm comin' through
Straight on, straight on for you
Straight on, straight on
Straight on for you

You made my mind
Now I'm stronger, now I'm comin' through
Straight on, straight on for you
Straight on, straight on

Straight on for you



If you want something to play with
Go and find yourself a toy
Baby my time is too expensive
And I'm not your little boy

If you are serious
Don't play with my heart it makes me furious
But if you want me to love you
Then baby I will, girl you know I will

Tell it like it is
Don't be ashamed, let your conscience be your guide
But ooh now deep down inside me, i believe you love me
Forget your foolish pride

Life is too short to have sorrow
You may be here today and gone tomorrow
You might as well get what you want
So go on and live, baby go on and live

Tell it like it is
Have nothing to play with go find yourself a toy
But ooh, deep down deep inside me I belive you love me
Forget your foolish pride

If you are serious
Don't play, don't play with my heart it makes me furious
But if you want me to love you then baby i will, you know i will

Tell it like it is
My time is too expensive
And I'm not your little boy anymore

Tell it like it is
Don't be ashamed let you conscience be your guide



I've been lonely
I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending and that's all I can do
The love I'm sending
Ain't making it through to your heart
You've been hiding, never letting it show
Always trying to keep it under control
You got it down and you're well
On the way to the top
But there's something that you forgot

What about love
Don't you want someone to care about you
What about love
Don't let it slip away
What about love
I only want to share it with you
You might need it someday

I can't tell you what you're feeling inside
I can't sell you what you don't want to buy
Something's missing and you got to
Look back on your life
You know something here just ain't right

What about love
Don't you want someone to care about you
What about love
Don't let it slip away
What about love
I only want to share it with you
What about love
Don't you want someone to care about you
What about love
Don't let it slip away
What about love
I only want to share it with you



You're not sure what you want to do
With your life
But you sure don't want me in it
Yeah you're sure the life you're
Living with me
Can't go on one single minute
And there's a new one waiting
Outside this door
And now's the time to begin it

You found a new world and
You want to taste it
But that world can turn cold and
You better face it

Who will you run to when it all falls down
Who's gonna pick you world up off the ground
Who's gonna take away the tears you cry
Who's gonna love you baby as good as I

You won't know what it's like to live
On your own
You've always had me there beside you
You think it's easy finding
Someone out there
Who's gonna care as much as I do
What's gonna happen baby
When you find out
That there's no one there to cry to

You can tell the whole world how you're
Gonna make it
You can follow you heart but what ya do
When someone breaks it

Who will you run to when it all falls down
Who's gonna pick you world up off the ground
Who's gonna take away the tears you cry
Who's goona love you baby as good as I

You found a new world and
You want to taste it
But that world can turn cold and
You better face it

Who will you run to when it all falls down
Who's gonna pick you world up off the ground
Who's gonna take away the tears you cry
Who's gonna love you baby as good as I

Who will you run to when it all falls down
Who's gonna pick your world up off the ground
Who's gonna take away the tears you cry
Who's gonna love you baby as good as I



        Emma's very good opinion of Frank Churchill was a little shaken the following day, by hearing that he was gone off to London, merely to have his hair cut. A sudden freak seemed to have seized him at breakfast, and he had sent for a chaise and set off, intending to return to dinner, but with no more important view that appeared than having his hair cut. There was certainly no harm in his travelling sixteen miles twice over on such an errand; but there was an air of foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve. It did not accord with the rationality of plan, the moderation in expense, or even the unselfish warmth of heart, which she had believed herself to discern in him yesterday. Vanity, extravagance, love of change, restlessness of temper, which must be doing something, good or bad; heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and Mrs. Weston, indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general; he became liable to all these charges. His father only called him a coxcomb, and thought it a very good story; but that Mrs. Weston did not like it, was clear enough, by her passing it over as quickly as possible, and making no other comment than that "all young people would have their little whims."

        With the exception of this little blot, Emma found that his visit hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him. Mrs. Weston was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made himself—how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether. He appeared to have a very open temper—certainly a very cheerful and lively one; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions, a great deal decidedly right; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard, was fond of talking of him—said he would be the best man in the world if he were left to himself; and though there was no being attached to the aunt, he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude, and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect. This was all very promising; and, but for such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut, there was nothing to denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him; the honour, if not of being really in love with her, of being at least very near it, and saved only by her own indifference—(for still her resolution held of never marrying)—the honour, in short, of being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance.

        Mr. Weston, on his side, added a virtue to the account which must have some weight. He gave her to understand that Frank admired her extremely—thought her very beautiful and very charming; and with so much to be said for him altogether, she found she must not judge him harshly. As Mrs. Weston observed, "all young people would have their little whims."

        There was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry, not so leniently disposed. In general he was judged, throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury, with great candour; liberal allowances were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man—one who smiled so often and bowed so well; but there was one spirit among them not to be softened, from its power of censure, by bows or smiles—Mr. Knightley. The circumstance was told him at Hartfield; for the moment, he was silent; but Emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself, over a newspaper he held in his hand, "Hum! just the trifling, silly fellow I took him for." She had half a mind to resent; but an instant's observation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings, and not meant to provoke; and therefore she let it pass.

        Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings, Mr. and Mrs. Weston's visit this morning was in another respect particularly opportune. Something occurred while they were at Hartfield, to make Emma want their advice; and, which was still more lucky, she wanted exactly the advice they gave.

        This was the occurrence:—The Coles had been settled some years in Highbury, and were very good sort of people—friendly, liberal, and unpretending; but, on the other hand, they were of low origin, in trade, and only moderately genteel. On their first coming into the country, they had lived in proportion to their income, quietly, keeping little company, and that little unexpensively; but the last year or two had brought them a considerable increase of means—the house in town had yielded greater profits, and fortune in general had smiled on them. With their wealth, their views increased; their want of a larger house, their inclination for more company. They added to their house, to their number of servants, to their expenses of every sort; and by this time were, in fortune and style of living, second only to the family at Hartfield. Their love of society, and their new dining-room, prepared every body for their keeping dinner-company; and a few parties, chiefly among the single men, had already taken place. The regular and best families Emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite—neither Donwell, nor Hartfield, nor Randalls. Nothing should tempt her to go, if they did; and she regretted that her father's known habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than she could wish. The Coles were very respectable in their way, but they ought to be taught that it was not for them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would visit them. This lesson, she very much feared, they would receive only from herself; she had little hope of Mr. Knightley, none of Mr. Weston.

        But she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks before it appeared, that when the insult came at last, it found her very differently affected. Donwell and Randalls had received their invitation, and none had come for her father and herself; and Mrs. Weston's accounting for it with "I suppose they will not take the liberty with you; they know you do not dine out," was not quite sufficient. She felt that she should like to have had the power of refusal; and afterwards, as the idea of the party to be assembled there, consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her, occurred again and again, she did not know that she might not have been tempted to accept. Harriet was to be there in the evening, and the Bateses. They had been speaking of it as they walked about Highbury the day before, and Frank Churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence. Might not the evening end in a dance? had been a question of his. The bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits; and her being left in solitary grandeur, even supposing the omission to be intended as a compliment, was but poor comfort.

        It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were at Hartfield, which made their presence so acceptable; for though her first remark, on reading it, was that "of course it must be declined," she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do, that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful.

        She owned that, considering every thing, she was not absolutely without inclination for the party. The Coles expressed themselves so properly—there was so much real attention in the manner of it—so much consideration for her father. "They would have solicited the honour earlier, but had been waiting the arrival of a folding-screen from London, which they hoped might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any draught of air, and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour of his company." Upon the whole, she was very persuadable; and it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be done without neglecting his comfort—how certainly Mrs. Goddard, if not Mrs. Bates, might be depended on for bearing him company—Mr. Woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his daughter's going out to dinner on a day now near at hand, and spending the whole evening away from him. As for his going, Emma did not wish him to think it possible, the hours would be too late, and the party too numerous. He was soon pretty well resigned.

        "I am not fond of dinner-visiting," said he—"I never was. No more is Emma. Late hours do not agree with us. I am sorry Mr. and Mrs. Cole should have done it. I think it would be much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer, and take their tea with us—take us in their afternoon walk; which they might do, as our hours are so reasonable, and yet get home without being out in the damp of the evening. The dews of a summer evening are what I would not expose any body to. However, as they are so very desirous to have dear Emma dine with them, and as you will both be there, and Mr. Knightley too, to take care of her, I cannot wish to prevent it, provided the weather be what it ought, neither damp, nor cold, nor windy." Then turning to Mrs. Weston, with a look of gentle reproach—"Ah! Miss Taylor, if you had not married, you would have staid at home with me."

        "Well, sir," cried Mr. Weston, "as I took Miss Taylor away, it is incumbent on me to supply her place, if I can; and I will step to Mrs. Goddard in a moment, if you wish it."

        But the idea of any thing to be done in a moment, was increasing, not lessening, Mr. Woodhouse's agitation. The ladies knew better how to allay it. Mr. Weston must be quiet, and every thing deliberately arranged.

        With this treatment, Mr. Woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking as usual. "He should be happy to see Mrs. Goddard. He had a great regard for Mrs. Goddard; and Emma should write a line, and invite her. James could take the note. But first of all, there must be an answer written to Mrs. Cole."

        "You will make my excuses, my dear, as civilly as possible. You will say that I am quite an invalid, and go no where, and therefore must decline their obliging invitation; beginning with my compliments, of course. But you will do every thing right. I need not tell you what is to be done. We must remember to let James know that the carriage will be wanted on Tuesday. I shall have no fears for you with him. We have never been there above once since the new approach was made; but still I have no doubt that James will take you very safely. And when you get there, you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you again; and you had better name an early hour. You will not like staying late. You will get very tired when tea is over."

        "But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired, papa?"

        "Oh! no, my love; but you will soon be tired. There will be a great many people talking at once. You will not like the noise."

        "But, my dear sir," cried Mr. Weston, "if Emma comes away early, it will be breaking up the party."

        "And no great harm if it does," said Mr. Woodhouse. "The sooner every party breaks up, the better."

        "But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles. Emma's going away directly after tea might be giving offence. They are good-natured people, and think little of their own claims; but still they must feel that any body's hurrying away is no great compliment; and Miss Woodhouse's doing it would be more thought of than any other person's in the room. You would not wish to disappoint and mortify the Coles, I am sure, sir; friendly, good sort of people as ever lived, and who have been your neighbours these ten years."

        "No, upon no account in the world, Mr. Weston; I am much obliged to you for reminding me. I should be extremely sorry to be giving them any pain. I know what worthy people they are. Perry tells me that Mr. Cole never touches malt liquor. You would not think it to look at him, but he is bilious—Mr. Cole is very bilious. No, I would not be the means of giving them any pain. My dear Emma, we must consider this. I am sure, rather than run the risk of hurting Mr. and Mrs. Cole, you would stay a little longer than you might wish. You will not regard being tired. You will be perfectly safe, you know, among your friends."

        "Oh yes, papa. I have no fears at all for myself; and I should have no scruples of staying as late as Mrs. Weston, but on your account. I am only afraid of your sitting up for me. I am not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with Mrs. Goddard. She loves piquet, you know; but when she is gone home, I am afraid you will be sitting up by yourself, instead of going to bed at your usual time—and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort. You must promise me not to sit up."

        He did, on the condition of some promises on her side: such as that, if she came home cold, she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly; if hungry, that she would take something to eat; that her own maid should sit up for her; and that Serle and the butler should see that every thing were safe in the house, as usual.

        

        



Sangre por sangre, blood for blood
Sangre por sangre, blood for blood
Sangre por sangre, blood for blood
Sangre por sangre, blood for blood

Betraying a trust is a must in your mind
The agenda's just business as usual
Remember the imbecile the fire's they light
Cities smolder with the innocent victims
Democracy is hypocrisy, dictatorship is what we need
Because really what's the fucking difference?
So come on in and take a seat, and listen to the lies they love to preach
Because the truth would just be fucking senseless

Eye for an eye and
Blood for blood
You better get your gun (blood for blood!)
For every action reaction
And death is business
Eye for an eye and
Blood for blood
You better grab your gun (blood for blood!)
Can't take it back
What's done is done I want blood for blood

Ashes to ashes and dust to the death of
What we were to what we've become
I'll put my faith into our heroes that fight for our lives
Until the war is won
Dishonesty is given to me, anxiety is my disease
But, the privileged they've got it made
So raise a glass to the one percent that have it all
Keep me in the shit and send me in the screaming fits of fucking rage!

Eye for an eye and
Blood for blood
You better get your gun (blood for blood!)
For every action reaction
And death is business
Eye for an eye and
Blood for blood
You better grab your gun (blood for blood!)
Can't take it back
What's done is done I want
Blood for blood

Quarter oppressors, it's too late for surrender
Time to pay your penance all together, forever
This spinning web of deception, lies begin to constrict
The walls of fate have a gate that's sealed around you
Brick by brick

Eye for an eye and
Blood for blood
You better get your gun (blood for blood!)
For every action reaction
And death is business
Eye for an eye and
Blood for blood
You better grab your gun (blood for blood!)
Can't take it back
What's done is done I want
Blood for blood

Sangre por sangre!
Blood for blood!
Sangre por sangre!
Blood for blood!



As the autumn wind whispers through the tall and lonely pines
And the hour of fate is drawing close at hand
Freebird falling from the sky
Brings a bitter end to another southern man
But there's a grey ghost runnin' through the night
An echo of the sadness and the pain
Grey ghost runnin' through the night
The man is gone but his spirit will remain

Fast like them, the music is just a thin disguise
For the heartache and the fear of growin' old
Without the one that means the most it makes you realise
That you're the one that's left out in the cold
There's a grey ghost runnin' through the night
An echo of the sadness and the pain
Grey ghost runnin' through the night
The man is gone but his spirit will remain

Dealer of death has dealt the losing hand
And it's a cold fact the cards don't ever lie
Through the fire dream of things to come is such a ??? pain
When the memories are all that's left behind
There's a grey ghost runnin' through the night
An echo of the sadness and the pain
Grey ghost runnin' through the night
The man is gone but his spirit will remain



Saturday night I was downtown
Working for the FBI
Sitting in a nest of bad men
Whiskey bottles piling high

Bootlegging boozer on the west side
Full of people who are doing wrong
Just about to call up the DA man
When I heard this woman singing a song

A pair of 45's made me open my eyes
My temperature started to rise
She was a long cool woman in a black dress
Just a 5'9" beautiful tall
With just one look I was a bad mess
'Cause that long cool woman had it all

Woo!

I saw her head up to the table
With a tall walking big black cat
Well, Charlie said "I hope that you're able, boy
'Cause I'm telling you she knows where it's at"
When suddenly we heard the sirens
And everybody started to run
I jumped down and across the table
When I heard somebody shooting a gun

Well, the DA was pumping my left hand
And then she was a-holding my right
Well, I told her "Don't get scared
'Cause you're gonna be spared"

Well I've gotta be forgiven
If I wanna spend my living
With a long cool woman in a black dress
Just a 5'9" beautiful tall
Well, with just one look I was a bad mess
'Cause that long cool woman had it all
Had it all, had it all
Had it all, had it all
Had it all, had it all



Hot summer night
Storm clouds in the air
My eyes' lids so heavy
I'm feeling in the past tense
I'm hardly aware

I don't want you on the phone
Don't you play good girl with me
Why must I always say it again?

I've got a new girl now
I've got a new girl now
I've got a new girl now
And she's a lot like you

I tried to wash my face
But my head fell too low
I tried to bear with myself
But my mind wouldn't stay at home

I don't care if you're sitting at home
Somebody has broken into me
Why must I always say it again?

I got a new girl now
I got a new girl now
I got a new girl now
And she's a lot like you

I don't want you on the phone
Don't you play good girl with me
Why must I always say it again?

I've got a new girl now
I've got a new girl now
I've got a new girl now
And she's a lot like you

I've got a new girl now
I've got a new girl now
I've got a new girl now
And she's a lot like you
Lot like you
Lot like you
Just like you



Holy Moses met the Pharaoh
Yeah, he tried to set him straight
Looked him in the eye
“Let my people go”

Holy Moses on the mountain
High above the golden calf
Went to get the Ten Commandments
He’s just gonna break ‘em in half

All you zombies hide your faces
All you people in the street
All you sittin’ in high places
The pieces gonna fall on you

No one ever spoke to Noah
They all laughed at him instead
Working on his ark
Workin’ all by himself

Only Noah saw it coming
Forty days and forty nights
Took his sons and daughters with him
They were the Israelites

All you zombies hide your faces
All you people in the street
All you sittin’ in high places
The rain’s gonna fall on you

Holy Father, what’s the matter
Where have all your children gone
Sittin’ in the dark
Livin’ all by themselves
You don’t have to hide anymore



She was a be-bop baby on a hard day's night
She was hangin' on Johnny, he was holdin' on tight
I could feel her coming from a mile away
There was no use talking, there was nothing to say
When the band began to play and play

And we danced like a wave on the ocean, romanced
We were liars in love and we danced
Swept away for a moment by chance
And we danced and danced and danced

I met my be-bop baby at the Union Hall
She could dance all night and shake the paint off the wall
But when I saw her smile across a crowded room
Well I knew we'd have to leave the party soon
As the band began to play out of tune

And we danced like a wave on the ocean, romanced
We were liars in love and we danced
Swept away for a moment by chance
And we danced and danced and danced

The endless beat, she's walkin' my way
Hear the music fade when she says
Are we getting too close, do we dare to get closer
The room is spinning, she whispers my name

And we danced like a wave on the ocean, romanced
We were liars in love and we danced
Swept away for a moment by chance
And we danced and danced

And we danced like a wave on the ocean, romanced
We were liars in love and we danced
Swept away for a moment by chance
And we danced and danced and danced
And danced and danced and danced
And danced and danced and danced

And we danced
And we danced
And we danced

And we danced and danced and danced
And danced and danced and danced
And danced and danced and danced



Yeah-eah!

I want a new drug
One that won't make me sick
One that won't make me crash my car
Or make me feel three feet thick

I want a new drug
One that won't hurt my head
One that won't make my mouth too dry
Or make my eyes too red

One that won't make me nervous
Wondering what to do
One that makes me feel like
I feel when I'm with you
When I'm alone with you

I want a new drug
One that won't spill
One that don't cost too much
Or come in a pill

I want a new drug
One that won't go away
One that won't keep me up all night
One that won't make me sleep all day

One that won't make me nervous
Wondering what to do
One that makes me feel like
I feel when I'm with you
When I'm alone with you
I'm alone with you, baby

I want a new drug
One that does what it should
One that won't make me feel too bad
One that won't make me feel too good

I want a new drug
One with no doubt
One that won't make me talk too much
Or make my face break out

One that won't make me nervous
Wondering what to do
One that makes me feel like
I feel when I'm with you
When I'm alone with you
I'm alone with you

You take the urban noise with some durban poison
It's gonna lessen your load

Black Nepalese, it got you weak in your knees
Only seeds and dust that you got bust on
You know it's so hard to please

You know you're jailhouse-bound

Oh, yeah, radioactive
Don't you stand, stand too close
You might catch it



[Verse 1]
Here comes the woman, with the look in her eye
Raised on leather, with flesh on her mind
Words as weapons, sharper than knives
Makes you wonder, how the other half die? Other half die
Makes you wonder, wonder, wonder

Here come the man, with the look in his eye
Fed on nothing, but full of pride
Look at them go, look at them kick
Makes you wonder, how the other half live

[Hook]
The devil inside, the devil inside
Every single one of us the devil inside
The devil inside, the devil inside
Every single one of us the devil inside

[Verse 2]
Here come the world, with the look in its eye
Future uncertain, but certainly slight
Look at the faces, listen to the bells
It's hard to believe we need a place called hell, place called hell

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Here comes the woman, with the look in her eye
Raised on leather, with flesh on her mind
Words as weapons sharper than knives
Makes you wonder, how the other half die

[Hook x2]

[Outro]
The devil inside, yeah, yeah, yeah
The devil inside, yeah, yeah, yeah

Please take my hand

Huh, huh
All right, uh, hey, ha!



As the sun breaks above the ground
An old man stands on the hill
As the ground warms to the first rays of light
A birdsong shatters the still

His eyes are ablaze
See the madman in his gaze

Fly on your way, like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly and touch the sun

Now the crowd breaks and a young boy appears
Looks the old man in the eye
As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd
"In the name of God, my father, I fly"

His eyes seem so glazed
As he flies on the wings of a dream
Now he knows his father betrayed
Now his wings turn to ashes, to ashes his grave

Fly on your way, like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly and touch the sun

Fly, on your way, like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly, touch the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly

Fly as high as the sun



White man came across the sea
He brought us pain and misery
He killed our tribes, killed our creed
He took our game for his own need
We fought him hard, we fought him well
Out on the plains we gave him hell
But many came too much for Cree
Oh will we ever be set free?

Riding through dust clouds and barren wastes
Galloping hard on the plains
Chasing the redskins back to their holes
Fighting them at their own game
Murder for freedom the stab in the back
Women and children are cowards attack

Run to the hills, run for your lives
Run to the hills, run for your lives

Soldier blue in the barren wastes
Hunting and killing their game
Raping the women and wasting the men
The only good Indians are tame
Selling them whiskey and taking their gold
Enslaving the young and destroying the old

Run to the hills, run for your lives
Run to the hills, run for your lives

[Guitar Solo]

Run to the hills, run for your lives
Run to the hills, run for your lives
Run to the hills, run for your lives
Run to the hills, run for your lives



[Spoken intro: Barry Clayton]
Woe to you, Oh Earth and Sea
For the Devil sends the beast with wrath
Because he knows the time is short
Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast
For it is a human number
Its number is Six hundred and sixty six

[Verse 1: Bruce Dickinson]
I left alone, my mind was blank
I needed time to think to get the memories from my mind
What did I see? Can I believe that what I saw
That night was real and not just fantasy?
Just what I saw, in my old dreams, were they
Reflections of my warped mind staring back at me?
Cause in my dream, it's always there
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair

YEAH!

[Verse 2]
The night was black, was no use holding back
Cause I just had to see, was someone watching me?
In the mist, dark figures move and twist
Was this all for real or just some kind of hell?

[Chorus 1]
666 the number of the beast
Hell and fire was spawned to be released

[Verse 3]
Torches blazed and sacred chants were praised
As they start to cry, hands held to the sky
In the night, the fires burning bright
The ritual has begun, Satan's work is done

[Chorus 2]
666 the number of the beast
Sacrifice is going on tonight

[Guitar solo: Dave Murray]
[Guitar solo: Adrian Smith]

[Verse 4]
This can't go on, I must inform the law
Can this still be real, or just some crazy dream?
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
They seem to mesmerize, can't avoid their eyes

[Chorus 3]
666 the number of the beast
666 the one for you and me

[Verse 5]
I'm coming back, I will return
And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn
I have the fire, I have the force
I have the power to make my evil take its course



[Verse 1]
You'll take my life but I'll take yours too
You'll fire your musket but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand there's no turning back
The bugle sounds the charge begins
But on this battlefield no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horse's breath
As I plunge on into certain death

[Refrain]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
The horse he sweats with fear we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall
We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day

[Refrain]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
We get so close, near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds takes my horse below
And as I lay there gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear I draw my parting groan

[Refrain]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh



[Verse 1]
From the coast of gold
Across the seven seas
I'm travellin' on
Far and wide
But now it seems
I'm just a stranger to myself
And all the things I sometimes do
It isn't me but someone else
I close my eyes, and think of home
Another city goes by in the night
Ain't it funny how it is
You never miss it 'til it's gone away
And my heart is lying there
And will be 'til my dying day

[Chorus]
So understand
Don't waste your time always searching for
Those wasted years
Face up... make your stand
And realize you're living in the golden years

[Verse 2]
Too much time on my hands
I got you on my mind
Can't ease this pain, so easily
When you can't find the words to say
It's hard to make it through another day
And it makes me wanna cry
And throw my hands up to the sky

[Chorus]
So understand
Don't waste your time always searching for
Those wasted years
Face up... make your stand
And realize you're living in the golden years
So understand
Don't waste your time always searching for
Those wasted years
Face up... make your stand
And realize you're living in the golden years
So understand
Don't waste your time always searching for
Those wasted years
Face up... make your stand
And realize you're living in the golden years



{Intro}

Does she walk? Does she talk?
Does she come complete?
My homeroom homeroom angel
Always pulled me from my seat

She was pure like snowflakes
No one could ever stain
The memory of my angel
Could never cause me pain

Years go by I'm lookin' through a girly magazine
And there's my homeroom angel on the pages in-between

[Chorus]

My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
Angel is the centerfold

My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
Angel is the centerfold

Slipped me notes under the desk
While I was thinkin' about her dress
I was shy I turned away
Before she caught my eye

I was shakin' in my shoes
Whenever she flashed those baby-blues
Something had a hold on me
When angel passed close by

Those soft and fuzzy sweaters
Too magical to touch
Too see her in that negligee
Is really just too much

My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
Angel is the centerfold

My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
Angel is the centerfold

Nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

It's okay I understand
This ain't no never-never land
I hope that when this issue's gone
I'll see you when your clothes are on

Take you car, Yes we will
We'll take your car and drive it
We'll take it to a motel room
And take 'em off in private

A part of me has just been ripped
The pages from my mind are stripped
Oh no, I can't deny it
Oh yea, I guess I gotta buy it!

My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
Angel is the centerfold

My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
Angel is the centerfold

Nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

{Outro}
My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
Angel is the centerfold



I could see it was a rough-cut Tuesday
Slow-motion weekdays stare me down
Her lipstick reflex got me wound
There were no defects to be found
Snapshot image froze without a sound

Thursday morning was a hot flash-factor
Her face still focused in my mind
Test-strip proof-sheet love is hard to find
Friday night we'll dance the spotlight grind
Stop-time heart for me if she's not mine

CHORUS:
Freeze-Frame! (Freeze-Frame!) (REPEAT TWICE)
Freeze-Frame! Now Freeze!
Now I'm lookin' at a flashback Sunday
Zoom lens feelings just won't disappear
Close-up darkroom sweet-talk in my ear
Her hot-spot love for me is strong
This freeze-frame moment can't be wrong
CHORUS (repeat once)
Freeze frame...

FADE



Yeah, now don't touch the knobs
'Cause I think we're gonna
Have some with this one here

Oh, yeah
You got to give it to me
You got to give it to me
You got to give it to me
You got to give it to me

You're so slick, honey
Know every trick now
You know I want it
I want it so bad
You know I need it
I can't believe it
So come on baby
Please relieve it

Got to give it to me
You got to give it to me
Got to give it to me
You got to give it to me

You've been bugging me
Every night now
You say you want it
You want it right now
I can't get through it
And I can't get to it
So come on, baby, please

Got to get it up (get it up)
Come on, you got to
Get it up (get it up)
You got to get it up (get it up)
Babe, you got to give it to me
(Give it to me)
You got to give it to me
(Give it to me)
You got to give it to me
(Give it to me)
You got to give it to me
(Give it to me)

Why keep me cold
When it's so warm inside
Come on, baby, your love
Is too good to hide
Woah, yeah



Yeah

They're dancing on the ceiling, they're dancing on the floor
People everywhere coming through the door
They know there's a party going on
Through the dance and romance all night long

I know it's cold outside
Come on baby, I'll keep you satisfied
All you got to do is move
Every time you steal that groove

It ain't nothing but a party
It ain't nothing but a party
It ain't nothing but a party, baby
It ain't nothing but a house party

Come on baby dig that crazy soul
I know you're gonna lose control
You can do the boogaloo
Anything that you want to

I know it's cold outside
Come on baby, I'll keep you satisfied
All you got to do is move
Every time you steal that groove

It ain't nothing but a party
It ain't nothing but a party
It ain't nothing but a party, baby
It ain't nothing but a house party
Yeah c'mon, yeah
I know baby

I know it's cold outside
Come on baby, I'll keep you satisfied
All you got to do is move
Every time you steal that groove

It ain't nothing but a party
It ain't nothing but a party
It ain't nothing but a party, baby
It ain't nothing but a house party

I said move it, groove it
Baby, don't you lose it
I said, roll is, stroll it
Baby, don't control it

It ain't nothing but a party baby
It ain't nothing but a party baby
It ain't nothing but a party baby
It ain't nothing but a house party

It ain't nothing but a party
It ain't nothing but a party
It ain't nothing but a party
It ain't nothing but a party

It ain't nothing but a party
It ain't nothing but a party
It ain't nothing but a party
Comes in the body

It ain't nothing but a party
It ain't nothing but a party
Comes in the body
...

(Spoken)
Hold on this song has a little introduction to it
It's ain't supposed to be sad though you might feel it that way
It's a song about desperation
Every now and then we do get desperate

This is a song about L-O-V-E
And if you abuse it you're gonna lose it
And if you lose it you're gonna abuse and
If you abuse it you ain't gonna be able to choose it
Cuz you ain't gonna have it further on down the line
Things ain't gonna be so fine
You're gonna to be sitting there on your little machine
Tryin' to look and keep it clean
You're going to be home playing bingo all night all alone
That's why your sittin there by the telephone
And you know that she ain't goin' to call you!

So you put on the TV and you're watchin' Johnny Carson
Segwayin right into the Tomorrow show
But that don't got the go so you turn it off ya turn on the radio
The radio don't seem to get the click so you say
"Hey Man, I can't lickety split"
You start to open up a little book
And there's somethin there you got to overlook
And you say "BABY, you know there's somethin on my mind!
"You say "Baby there's somethin' on my mind -
I know that you're home and I know you ain't all alone! "

So you start walking over to her house
And you get over to her house
And you walk over to her door
You start poundin on her door, you say
"Open up the door bitch!
This is wooba gooba with the green teeth, let me in!!"

Well, she opens up the door
And then you just kinda walk up to her and say
"Baby", you look up way up at her green mascara
And you say "Oh my darling
You know her and me was at the party as friends
Do not believe what they say
That's only gossip that they tellin ya
A wise cracker line!"
You say Darlin'!!!

Take your big curls and just squeeze them down Ratumba
What's the name of the chick with the long hair?
(Rapunzel!) ya say hey Rapunzel! heh heh heh
Hey Reputah! Reputa the Beautah!
Hey Reputa the Beautah flip me down your hair
And let me climb up to the ladder of your love!!
Because this is what woofa goofa's sayin to ya
"Love comes once and when it comes
You've got to grab it fast cuz sometimes the love
You grab ain't gonna last and
I believe I musta
You know I think I musta
You know baby I think I musta
You know I think I musta
I musta got lost!!!!!!!

1 2 3

(Sung)
Never thought about tomorrow
Seemed like a long time to come
How could I be so blind, baby
Not to see you were the one

I let ya slip on from me baby
I let you walk on by
Shoulda loved, you had told me
I refused to love, I let it die

I musta got lost, musta got lost, I musta got lost
Somewhere down the line
Musta got lost, musta got lost
Give away the days you were mine

Don't know why I let you leave me
Honey, I don't know
Say its hard to see lovers comin' babe
Honey I've a way to see them go

Musta got lost, musta got lost, musta got lost
Somewhere down the line
Musta got lost, I got lost
Give away the days you were mine

Love can be a sweet thing
Girl I just don't understand
Made a game outta lovin' you
Now I hold the losin' hand

Oh, I musta got lost, musta got lost, musta got lost
Somewhere down the line
Musta got lost, I got lost, girl
Give away the days you were mine

I just don't understand it
I just don't understand it
I just don't understand it

And I musta got lost, musta got lost, musta got lost
Somewhere down the line, hey
Musta got lost, baby, I got lost girl
Give away them days you were mine

Musta got lost, I got lost, musta got lost
Somewhere down the line
Musta got lost, oh I got lost girl
Give away them days you were mine

C'mon
Oh, I got lost, babe, double-crossed
Your lovin, give it to me all night long

(Instrumental Break)

I said your love got me higher
Than I ever been lifted before

I said your love has got me higher
Than I ever been lifted before!!!

Somewhere!!!!!



Get up in the morning kick the covers from my bed
The sunlight in my eyes is playing tricks with my head
I work like a dog on the job every day
I'm tryin make some money so I can go and play

In the night time
That's the right time
In the night time
That's the right time
I wanna be with you in the night time

I come home from work you know I'm tired and I'm beat
I run in the kitchen get me something to eat
I jump in the shower wash the world off my back
I'm gonna get you baby that's a natural fact!

In the night time
That's the right time
In the night time
That's the right time
I wanna be with you in the night time

- Break - Guitar and Harmonica -

A hundred million people they got nothing to say
They're running around in circles they just live for today
Stick with me baby I'll show you how to fly
We'll make such pretty music watch the world go by

In the night time
That's the right time
In the night time
That's the right time
I wanna be with you in the night time

- Break - Guitar and Harmonica -

Get up in the morning kick the covers from my bed
The sunlight in my eyes is playing tricks with my head
I work like a dog on the job every day
I'm tryin make some money so I can go and play

In the night time
That's the right time
In the night time
That's the right time
Here we go
I wanna be with you in the night time
In the night time
In the night time
That's the right time
Back in the night time
Mmmmm that's the right time
Yes that's the right time
That's a nice time
That's my time
Mmmmm night time



[Instrumental]



Down on the boulevard they take it hard
They look at life with such disregard
They say it can't be won
The way the game is run
But if you choose to stay
You end up playing anyway
It's okay-

The kids in shock up and down the block
The folks are home playing beat the clock
Down at the golden cup
They set the young ones up
Under the neon light
Selling day for night
It's alright-

Nobody rides for free
Nobody gets it like they want it to be
Nobody hand you any guarantee
Nobody

The hearts are hard and the times are tough
Down on the boulevard the night's enough
And time passes slow
Between the store front shadows and the street lights glow

Everybody walks right by like they're safe or something
They don't know-

Nobody knows you
Nobody owes you nothin
Nobody shows you what they're thinking
Nobody baby

Hey, hey, baby
You got to watch the street, keep your feet
And be on guard
Make it pay baby
It's only time on the boulevard



Doctor, my eyes have seen the years
And the slow parade of fears without crying
Now I want to understand

I have done all that I could
To see the evil and the good without hiding
You must help me if you can

Doctor, my eyes
Tell me what is wrong
Was I unwise to leave them open for so long?

Cause I have wandered through this world
And as each moment has unfurled
I've been waiting to awaken from these dreams
People go just where they will
I never noticed them until I got this feeling
That it's later than it seems

Doctor, my eyes
Tell me what you see
I hear their cries
Just say if it's too late for me

Doctor, my eyes
Cannot see the sky
Is this the prize for having learned how not to cry?



Now the seats are all empty
Let the roadies take the stage
Pack it up and tear it down
They're the first to come and last to leave
Working for that minimum wage
They'll set it up in another town
Tonight the people were so fine
They waited there in line
And when they got up on their feet they made the show
And that was sweet ...
But I can hear the sound
Of slamming doors and folding chairs
And that's a sound they'll never know

Now roll them cases out and lift them amps
Haul them trusses down and get'em up them ramps
Cause when it comes to moving me
You guys are the champs
But when that last guitar's been packed away
You know that I still want to play
So just make sure you got it all set to go
Before you come for my piano

{instrumental}

But the band's on the bus
And they're waiting to go
We've got to drive all night and do a show in Chicago
Or Detroit, I don't know
We do so many shows in a row
And these towns all look the same
We just pass the time in our hotel rooms
And wander 'round backstage
Till those lights come up and we hear that crowd
And we remember why we came

Now we got country and western on the bus, R&B
We got disco on eight tracks and cassettes in stereo
We got rural scenes and magazines
And we got truckers on CB
And we got Richard Pryor on the video

We got time to think of the ones we love
While the miles roll away
But the only time that seems too short
Is the time that we get to play

People you've got the power over what we do
You can sit there and wait
Or you can pull us through
Come along, sing the song
You know you can't go wrong
Cause when that morning sun comes beating down
You're going to wake up in your town
But we'll be scheduled to appear
A thousand miles away from here

People stay just a little bit longer
We want to play -- just a little bit longer
Now the promoter don't mind
And the union don't mind
If we take a little time
And we leave it all behind and sing
One more song--
Oh, won't you stay just a little bit longer
Please, please, please, say you will
Say you will

Oh won’t you stay
Just a little bit longer
Oh won’t you stay
Just a little bit longer

And the promoter don’t mind
And the roadies don’t mind
If we take a little time
And we leave it all behind and sing
One more song



Pretty little one
How has it all begun?
They're teaching you how to walk
But you're already on the run
Little one--
What you gonna do?
Little one--
Honey, it's all up to you

Now your daddy's in the den shootin' up the evening news
Mama's with a friend, lately she's been so confused
Little one--
Come on and take my hand
I may not have the answer but I believe I got a plan

Honey you shake and I'll rattle and we'll roll on down the line
And see if we can't get in touch with a very close friend of mine
But let me clue you in, it ain't like him
To argue or pretend--
Honey let me introduce you to my redneck friend

Well they've got a little list of all those things of which they don't approve
They've got to keep their eyes on you or you might make your move
Little one--
I really wish you would
Little one--
I think the damage would do you good

Honey you shake and I'll rattle and we'll roll on down the line
We're going to forget all about the battle
It's gonna feel so fine
'Cause he's the missing link, the kitchen sink--
Eleven on a scale of ten
Honey let me introduce you to my redneck friend

Honey you shake and I'll rattle and we'll roll on down the line
I'm going to try to swing you up into my saddle
And then we'll run but you'll think we're flyin'
Now honey don't just stand there
Lookin' like this dream will never end
Honey let me introduce you to my redneck friend



[Intro]
Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels
Looking back at the years gone by like so many summer fields
In sixty-five I was seventeen and running up one-on-one
I don't know where I'm running now, I'm just running on

Running on, running on empty
Running on, running blind
Running on, running into the sun
But I'm running behind

Gotta do what you can just to keep your love alive
Trying not to confuse it with what you do to survive
In sixty-nine I was twenty-one and I called the road my own
I don't know when that road turned, into the road I'm on

Running on, running on empty
Running on, running blind
Running on, running into the sun
But I'm running behind

[Bridge]
Everyone I know, everywhere I go
People need some reason to believe
I don't know about anyone but me
If it takes all night, that'll be all right
If I can get you to smile before I leave

Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels
I don't know how to tell you all just how crazy this life feels
Look around for the friends that I used to turn to to pull me through
Looking into their eyes I see them running too

Running on, running on empty
Running on, running blind
Running on, running into the sun
But I'm running behind

Honey you really tempt me
You know the way you look so kind
I'd love to stick around but I'm running behind
(Running on)
You know I don't even know what I'm hoping to find
(Running blind)
Running into the sun but I'm running behind

[Outro]
Thank you!



Well, just look at that girl
With the lights comin' up in her eyes
She's got to be somebody's baby
She must be somebody's baby

All the guys on the corner stand back
And let her walk on by
She's got to be somebody's baby
She must be somebody's baby
She's got to be somebody's baby
She's so fine

She's probably somebody's only light
Gonna shine tonight
Yeah, she's probably somebody's baby, all right

I heard her talkin' with her friend
When she thought nobody else was around
She said she's got to be somebody's baby
She must be somebody's baby

Cause when the cars and the signs and the streetlights
Light up the town
She's got to be somebody's baby
She must be somebody's baby
She's got to be somebody's baby
She's so

She's gonna be somebody's only light
Gonna shine tonight
Yeah, she's gonna be somebody's baby tonight

I try to shut my eyes
But I can't get her outta my sight
I know I'm gonna know her
But I gotta get over my fright
Well, I'm just gonna walk up to her
I'm gonna talk to her tonight

Ah

Yeah, she's gonna be somebody's only light
Gonna shine tonight
Yeah, she's gonna be somebody's baby tonight

She's gonna be somebody's only light
Gonna shine tonight
Yeah, she's gonna be somebody's baby tonight

Gonna shine tonight, make her mine tonight
Gonna shine tonight, make her mine tonight
Gonna shine tonight, make her mine tonight
Ah
Gonna shine tonight, make her mine tonight
Gonna shine tonight, make her mine tonight
Gonna shine tonight, make her mine tonight

When we come to the place where the road and the sky collide
Throw me over the edge and let my spirit glide
They told me I was going to have to work for a living
But all I want to do is ride
I don't care where we're going from here
Honey, you decide

Well I spend my time at the bottom of a wishing well
And I can hear my dreams singing clear as a bell
I used to know where they ended and the world began
But now it's getting hard to tell
I could be just around the corner from heaven or a mile from hell

I'm just rolling away from yesterday
Behind the wheel of a stolen Chevrolet
I'm going to get a little higher
And see if I can hot-wire reality

Now can you see those dark clouds gathering up ahead?
They're going to wash this planet clean like the Bible said
Now you can hold on steady and try to be ready
But everybody's going to get wet
Don't think it won't happen just because it hasn't happened yet

I'm just rolling away from yesterday
Behind the wheel of a stolen Chevrolet
I'm going to get a little higher
And see if I can hot-wire reality



BLACK SCREEN

A desert wind moans sadly.  From somewhere within the wind
comes the tinkly, syrupy-sweet sounds of the Lennon Sisters
singing "My Favorite Things." A series of sepia images of
anti-war protests from the mid-sixties appear one after
another on the screen.

In the violently scrawled style of Ralph Steadman, the title
FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS splashes onto the screen.  A beat, and then it runs down and off revealing:

TITLE: "He who makes a beast of himself Gets rid of the pain
Of being a man."
Dr. Johnson

The VOICE OF HUNTER S. THOMPSON -- a.k.a. RAOUL DUKE:

DUKE (V/O)
We were somewhere around Barstow on
the edge of the desert when the
drugs began to take hold.

AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!

A red Chevy convertible -- THE RED SHARK -- wipes the black
screen.

EXT. ON THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY

AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!

THE RED SHARK races down the desert highway at a hundred
miles an hour.  THE STONES' "Sympathy For the Devil" blares.

AT THE WHEEL

STRANGELY STILL AND TENSE, RAOUL DUKE DRIVES -- SKELETAL,
BEER IN HAND -- STARES STRAIGHT AHEAD.

BESIDE HIM, FACE TURNED TO THE SUN, EYES CLOSED BEHIND
WRAPAROUND SPANISH SUNGLASSES, IS HIS SWARTHY AND UNNERVINGLY
UNPREDICTABLE ATTORNEY, DR. GONZO.

The music pounds DUKE stares straight ahead.  GONZO froths
up a can of beer - uses it as shaving foam.

DUKE (V/O)
I remember saying something like:
"I feel a bit lightheaded.  Maybe
you should drive..."

GONZO starts shaving.

2.


DUKE (V/O)
Suddenly there was a terrible roar
all around us and the sky was full
of what looked like huge bats, all
swooping and screeching and diving
around the car...

Close on DUKE -- shadows flutter across his face.  The
reflections of bats swirl within his eyes.  We push in close
to one eye ball -- SCREECHING SWIRLING BAT-LIKE SHAPES!

AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!

DUKE (V/O)
... and a voice was screaming: Holy
Jesus!  What are these goddamn
animals?

CUT TO WIDE SHOT OF CAR -

DUKE, eyes rigid, flails at the air.  No bats anywhere.
GONZO casually looks over...

GONZO
What are you yelling about?

DUCK SCREECHES to the side of the road.  The sudden wrench
makes GONZO nick his face with his razor.

DUKE
Never mind.  It's your turn to drive.

DUKE (V/O)
No point mentioning these bats.  I
thought.  The poor bastard will see
them soon enough.

DUKE hops out of the car, keeping an eye out for bats,
frantically opens the trunk to reveal what looks like A
MOBILE POLICE NARCOTICS LAB.  DUKE desperately rifles
through the impressive stash.

DUKE (V/O)
We had two bags of grass, seventy-
five pellets of mescaline, five
sheets of high powered blotter
acid, a salt shaker half full of
cocaine, a whole galaxy of multi-
colored uppers, downers, screamers,
laughers... Also a quart of tequila,
a quart of rum, a case of beer, a
pint of raw ether and two dozen
amyls.

3.


DUKE, eyes darting madly as he hears what sounds like the
SHRIEKS OF BATS returning, grabs an assortment along with
another six-pack of beer - slams the trunk shut and dives
back into the car.

DUKE (V/O)
Not that we needed all that for the
trip, but once you get locked into
a serious drug collection, the
tendency is to push it as far as
you can.

THE RED SHARK RACES INTO THE DISTANCE... on the ground,
weakly flapping is a SEMI-SQUASHED, SLOWLY DYING ANIMAL... A
BAT?

EXT. FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY

IN THE RED SHARK

GONZO grips the wheel - stares maniacally down the road - a
lousy driver.

DUKE (V/O)
The only thing that really worried
me was the ether.  There is nothing
in the world more helpless and
irresponsible and depraved than a
man in the depths of an ether binge.
And I knew we'd get into that
rotten stuff pretty soon.

The radio news wars with "SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL" on a tape
recorder.

RADIO NEWS
An overdose of heroin was listed as
the official cause of death for
pretty 19 year old Diane Hanby
whose body was found stuffed in a
refrigerator last week...

GONZO changes the station - "ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE, SWEET
JESUS, ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE" vies with "SYMPATHY"... He
sings along - washes a couple of pills back with a new beer.
The RED SHARK fishtails.

GONZO
"One toke over the line, sweet
Jesus."

4.


DUKE
(muttering to himself)
One toke.  You poor fool.  Wait
till you see those goddamn bats.

UP AHEAD - AT THE SIDE OF THE DESERTED ROAD

A LONE HITCHHIKER spots them, jumps up and sticks out a
thumb.  The RED SHARK roars past.  Then, fifty yards down
the road...

GONZO
Let's give that boy a lift.

GONZO wrenches the wheel - THE RED SHARK swerves to the side
of the road.

DUKE
We can't stop here - this is bat
country!

GONZO JAMS THE CAR INTO REVERSE AND ROCKETS BACKWARDS.  The
HITCHHIKER races to the car.  A poor OKIE KID with a big grin.

HITCHHIKER
Hot damn!  I never rode in a
convertible before!

Then the big grin freezes on the OKIE KID's face at the
sight of: DUKE and GONZO looking out at him with HYPER-
NORMAL, shit-eating SMILES.

DUKE
Is that right?  Well, I guess
you're about ready, eh?

The HITCHHIKER hesitates.

GONZO
We're your friends.  We're not like
the others.

DUKE
(hissing sharply)
No more of that talk or I'll put
the leeches on you.

DUKE turns back to the HITCHHIKER - smiles reassuringly.

EXT. EVEN FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY

The HITCHHIKER sits nervously in the back seat as the RED
SHARK screams down the road.

5.


GONZO sings along to the tape player.

The HITCHHIKER's eyes go to the door - considers jumping out
and taking his chances.

DUKE, sweating bullets, STARES AT THE HITCHHIKER in the rear
view mirror.

DUKE (V/O)
How long could we maintain, I
wondered.  How long before one of
us starts raving and jabbering at
this boy?  What will he think then?
This same lonely desert was the
last known home of the Manson family.

The HITCHHIKER's eyes notice a thin line of blood trickling
down GONZO's neck.

DUKE (V/O)
Would he make that grim connection
when my attorney starts screaming
about bats and huge manta rays
coming down on the car?

DUKE's mouth moves intermittently - sometimes in sync with
the words, sometimes not.

DUKE (V/O)
If so - well, we'll just have to
cut his head off and bury him
somewhere.  Because it goes without
saying that we can't turn him loose.
He'd report us at once to some kind
of outback Nazi law enforcement
agency, and they'll run us down
like dogs...

DUKE
(out loud to himself)
Jesus!  Did I say that?

DUKE (V/O)
Or just think it?  Was I talking?
Did they hear me?

GONZO
(reassuringly to HITCHHIKER)
It's okay.  He's admiring the shape
of your skull.

DUKE gives the HITCHHIKER a FINE BIG GRIN and the HITCHHIKER
giggles nervously.

6.


DUKE (V/O)
Maybe I better have a chat with
this boy I thought.  Perhaps if I
explain things, he'll rest easy...

DUKE
(roaring over the
road noise)
THERE'S ONE THING YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY UNDERSTAND --

The HITCHHIKER stares at him, not blinking.

DUKE
(yells)
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

The HITCHHIKER nods -- giggles -- terrified.  DUKE climbs
into the back seat.

DUKE
That's good.  Because I want you to
have all the background.  This is a
very ominous assignment -- with
overtones of extreme personal
danger.  I'm a Doctor of Journalism!
This is important, goddamnit!  This
is a true story!...
(WHACKS the BACK OF
THE DRIVER'S SEAT
with his fist)


The CAR SWERVES SICKENINGLY, then straightens out.

GONZO
(screams)
Keep your hands off my fucking neck!

The HITCHHIKER makes a sudden lunge for freedom.  DUKE GRABS
HIM BACK DOWN.

DUKE (V/O)
Our vibrations were getting nasty --
but why?  Was there no communication
in this car?  Had we deteriorated
to the level of dumb beasts?

The HITCHHIKER STRUGGLES IN PANIC.

7.


DUKE
(to HITCHHIKER)
I want you to understand that this
man at the wheel is my attorney!
He's not just some dingbat I found
on the Strip.  He's a foreigner.  I
think he's probably Samoan.  But it
doesn't matter, does it?  Are you
prejudiced?

HITCHHIKER
Hell, no!

DUKE
I didn't think so.  Because in
spite of his race, this man is
extremely valuable to me.  Hell, I
forgot all about this beer.  You
want one?
(HITCHHIKER shakes
his head)
How about some ether?

HITCHHIKER
What?

DUKE
Never mind.  Let's get right to the
heart of this thing.  Twenty-four
hours ago we were sitting in the
Pogo Lounge of the Beverly Wills
Hotel...

INT. THE BEVERLY WILLS HOTEL POGO LOUNGE 1971 - DAY

A uniformed DWARF, carries a shockingly PINK TELEPHONE
through the glittering, tranquil POGO LOUNGE CROWD.  They
are the ELOI.  HENDRIX AFROS and DROOPING MUSTACHES and BELL
BOTTOMS and LOVE BEADS and BELLS.  ACTRESSES sip Singapore
Slings and PROMOTERS sip ACTRESSES in this MONIED, SANITISED
VERSION OF THE GREAT REVOLUTION YEARS.

DUKE (V/O)
... in the patio section, of
course, drinking Singapore Slings
with mescal on the side, hiding
from the brutish realities of this
foul year of Our Lord, 1971.

The DWARF reaches DUKE -- T-shirt, levis, sneakers and
shades.  GONZO -- white rayon bellbottoms and a khaki tank
top undershirt.  They are in the middle of a serious
conversation.

8.


DUKE
I'm telling you, the Salazar story
is getting too complicated.  The
weasels have started closing in.

The DWARF sneers.

DWARF
Perhaps this is the call you've
been waiting for all this time,
sir...

DUKE lifts the receiver -- listens...

DUKE
Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Uh-huh...

DUKE hangs up the PHONE with the DEAD-PAN EXPRESSION OF A
MOVIE SPY.

DWARF
That was headquarters.  They want
me to go to Las Vegas at once and
make contact with a Portuguese
photographer named Lacerda.  He'll
have the details.  All I have to do
is check into my sound proof suite
and he'll seek me out.

GONZO, says nothing for a moment, then POUNDS the table!

GONZO
God hell!  I think I see the
pattern!  This one sounds like real
trouble!  You're going to need
plenty of legal advice before this
thing is over.  As your attorney I
must advise you that you'll need a
very fast car with no top and after
that, the cocaine.  And then the
tape recorder, for special music,
and some Acapulco shirts...
(GONZO tucks his
khaki undershirt into
his white
bellbottoms -- he
means business!)
This blows my weekend, because
naturally I'll have to go with
you -- and we'll have to arm
ourselves.

9.


DUKE
Why not?  If a thing's worth doing,
it's worth doing right.

DUKE and GONZO are up and off.  The DWARF chases after them
with the (very large) check in his hand.

They sweep out through the Lounge door, unaware of it
swinging back into the face of the pursuing DWARF.

DUKE
I tell you, my man.  This is the
American Dream in action!  We'd be
fools not to ride this strange
torpedo all the way to the end.

GONZO
Indeed.  We must do it.  What kind
of story is this?

EXT. BEVERLY WILLS HOTEL - FRONT ENTRANCE - DAY

DUKE and GONZO emerge.

DUKE
The Mint 400!  The richest off-road
race for motorcycles and dune-
buggies in the history of organized
sport!
(handing parking
ticket to Valet)
-- a fantastic spectacle in honor
of some fatback grossero who owns
the luxurious Mint Hotel in the
heart of downtown Vegas... at least
that's what the press release says.

Their car arrives -- rusted out, smashed door panels.  They
jump in.

DUKE
We're going to have to drum it up
on our own.  Pure Gonzo Journalism.

And they're off in a cloud of black exhaust as the nose-
bleeding DWARF stumbles out with the unpaid bill in his hand.

EXT. SUNSET BLVD - DAY

The PINTO races through shot.

DUKE (V/O)
Getting hold of the drugs and
shirts had been no problem...

10.


EXT. POLYNESIAN BAR - DAY

The PINTO skids to a halt outside Polynesian bar, the back
window full of Hawaiian shirts.

DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
... but the car and tape recorder
were not easy things to round up at
6:30 on a Friday afternoon in
Hollywood.

INT. POLYNESIAN BAR - DAY

TORN YELLOW PAGES with dealer's ads ticked off lie in a pile
as GONZO yells into a PAYPHONE.  DUKE carries over four
Singapore Slings.

GONZO
O.K., O.K., yes.  Hang onto it.
We'll be there in thirty minutes.
(to DUKE -- hand over
the PHONE)
I finally located a car with
adequate horsepower and the proper
coloring.
(into PHONE)
What?!  OF COURSE the gentleman has
a major credit card!  Do you
realize who the fuck you're talking
to?

DUKE
Don't take any guff from these
swine.
(GONZO slams the
phone down)
Now we need a sound store with the
finest equipment.  Nothing dinky.
One of those new Belgian Heliowatts
with a voice-activated shotgun
mike, for picking up conversations
in oncoming cars.

GONZO
We won't make the nut unless we
have unlimited credit.

DUKE
We will.  You Samoans are all the
same.  You have no faith in the
essential decency of the white
man's culture.

11.


EXT. SUNSET BLVD - DUSK

The PINTO races down street.

DUKE (V/O)
The store was closed, but the
salesman said he would wait, if we
hurried...

EXT. SUNSET BLVD - TRAFFIC JAM - DUSK

They're stuck in a traffic jam -- clouds of exhaust.  DUKE
BANGS ON THE HORN IN FURY.

DUKE (V/O)
But we were delayed en route when a
Stingray in front of us killed a
pedestrain.

Directly in front of them: BLOODY CARNAGE -- a covered
corpse is loaded into an ambulance by PARAMEDICS.

EXT. CAR RENTAL AGENCY - NIGHT

DUKE (V/O)
We had trouble, again, at the car
rental agency.

Behind the wheel of the RED SHARK: DUKE grins with
satisfaction -- checking it out.  A nervous AGENT holds out
a clipboard.  DUKE signs without looking at the rental papers.

AGENT
Say... uh... you fellas are going
to be careful with this car, aren't
you?

DUKE
Of course.

DUKE throws the car into reverse -- roars backwards past the
gas pumps to where GONZO is unloading their rusted out car.

AGENT
Well, good god!  You just backed
over that two foot concrete abutment
and you didn't even slow down!
Forty-five in reverse!  And you
barely missed the pump!

DUKE
No harm done.  I always test the
transmission that way.  The rear
end.  For stress factors.

12.


GONZO transfers boxes of new sound equipment and a large box
of rum and ice into the RED SHARK.

AGENT
Say.  Are you fellows drinking?

DUKE
Not me.  We're responsible people.

He JAMS the car into LOW GEAR and lurches into traffic.  The
AGENT runs into the street and helplessly watches them go.

GONZO
There's another worrier.  He's
probably all cranked up on speed.

EXT. RUNDOWN BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT

STRANGE AND MAGICAL.  In the moonlight: the silhouetted
figures of DUKE and GONZO as they pack the RED SHARK.

DUKE (V/O)
We spent the rest of that night
rounding up materials and packing
the car.  Then we ate some mescaline
and went swimming.

The surf crashes in the distance...

EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - NIGHT

DUKE cries out as he dives into the ocean.  He lets himself
float up through the silvery bubbles...

DUKE AND GONZO FLOAT BEATIFICALLY IN THE GLOWING, SHIMMERING
MOONLIT SURF.

DUKE (V/O)
Our trip was different.  It was to
be a classic affirmation of
everything right and true in the
national character; a gross,
physical salute to the fantastic
possibilities of life in this
country.  But only for those with
true grit...

EXT. AND EVEN FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY

DUKE's intense face.

DUKE
...and we're chock full of that!

13.


GONZO
Damn right!

DUKE
My attorney understands this
concept, despite his racial handicap.
But do you?!

The HITCHHIKER nods -- giggles -- petrified.

DUKE (V/O)
He said he understood, but I could
see in his eyes that he didn't.  He
was lying to me.

GONZO
My heart!

GONZO clutches his heart.  The car veers off the road and
screeches to a halt.  He slumps over the wheel.

GONZO (CONT'D)
Where's the medicine?

DUKE
The medicine?  Yes, it's right here.

DUKE spills out 4 AMYL CAPSULES from a tin.

DUKE
Don't worry, this man has a bad
heart... Angina Pectoris.  But we
have a cure for it.

DUKE and GONZO break 2 AMYLS apiece -- INHALE DEEPLY.  GONZO
falls back on the seat, staring straight up at the sun.  The
HITCHHIKER looks petrified.

GONZO
(suddenly flailing
his naked arms at the sky)
Turn up the fucking music!  My
heart feels like an alligator!
Volume!  Clarity!  Bass!  We must
have bass!  What's wrong with us?
Are you goddamn old ladies?

DUKE
(turns up music to
full volume)
You scurvy shyster bastard!  Watch
your language!  You're talking to a
Doctor of Journalism!

14.


GONZO
(laughing uncontrollably)
What the fuck are we doing out here?
Somebody call the police!  We need
help!

DUKE
(to HITCHHIKER)
Pay no attention to this swine.  He
can't handle the medicine.
(he begins laughing)


GONZO
(to the HITCHHIKER)
The truth is we're going to Vegas
to croak a scag baron named Savage
Henry.  I've known him for years
but he ripped us off -- and you
know what that means, right?

GONZO pulls out a .357 Magnum -- waves it around.

GONZO (CONT'D)
Savage Henry has cashed his check!
We're going to rip his lungs out!

DUKE
And eat them!  That bastard won't
get away with this!  What's going
on in this country when a scum
sucker like that can get away with
sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?

GONZO cracks ANOTHER AMYL.

The HITCHHIKER SCRAMBLES OUT OF THE CAR, DOWN THE TRUNK LID,
AND FLEES.

HITCHHIKER
Thanks for the ride.  Thanks a lot.
I like you guys.  Don't worry about
me.

DUKE
(yells)
Wait a minute!  Come back and have
a beer!

The HITCHHIKER RUNS from car.

15.


GONZO
Good riddance.  That boy made me
nervous.  Did you see his eyes?
(laughing)
Jesus, this is good medicine.

DUKE glances back at the running HITCHHIKER.

DUKE
(suddenly clambering
into the front seat)
Move over!!  We have to get out of
California before that kid finds a
cop!

DUKE GUNS THE RED SHARK -- TAKES OFF DOWN THE ROAD...

EXT. UNBELIEVABLY FAR DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY

THE RED SHARK races -- DUKE at the wheel -- straight ahead
driving.

DUKE (V/O)
It was absolutely imperative that
we get to the Mint Hotel before the
deadline for press registration.
Otherwise, we might have to pay for
our suite.

GONZO wrestles with a shaker of COCAINE.  The top comes off
and the powder swirls away on the wind.

GONZO
Oh, Jesus!  Did you see what god
just did to us?

DUKE
God didn't do that!  You did it!
You're a fucking narcotics agent,
that was our cocaine, you pig!

GONZO
(waving his .357
Magnum at Duke)
You better be careful.  Plenty of
vultures out here.  They'll pick
your bones clean before morning.

DUKE
You whore!

GONZO tears up a BLOTTER OF ACID.

16.


GONZO
Here -- chew this.  It's your half
of the acid.

DUKE takes his half -- chews it.

DUKE
How long do I have?

GONZO
Maybe thirty more minutes.  As your
attorney, I advise you to drive at
top speed.  It'll be a goddamn
miracle if we can get there before
you turn into a wild animal.  Are
you ready for that?  Checking into
a Vegas hotel under a phony name
with intent to commit capital fraud
and a head full of acid.

DUKE (V/O)
Thirty minutes.  It was going to be
very close.

The RED SHARK screams along the highway past a billboard:
"DON'T GAMBLE WITH MARIJUANA! \ IN NEVADA: POSSESSION - 20
YEARS; SALE - LIFE!!"

EXT. LAS VEGAS MINT HOTEL - DUSK

The RED SHARK pulls up outside the MINT.  A great banner
spanning the street announces the MINT 400.

DUKE can feel the drug surging up inside him.  Clutching a
buckled beer can, sweat pouring, he stares fixedly at the
TICKET the ATTENDANT gives him.

DUKE
I need this, right?

ATTENDANT
I'll remember your face.

DUKE stares -- losing it...

DUKE (V/O)
There is no way of explaining the
terror I felt.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

DUKE waits in line at the front desk -- RIGID WITH PENT UP
ENERGY.  GONZO's ahead of him -- muscling in -- trying to
queue jump and failing.

17.


DUKE (V/O)
I was pouring sweat.  My blood is
too thick for Nevada.  I've never
been able to properly explain
myself in this climate.

A COUPLE move off and DUKE jerks forward -- stops -- eyes
fixed on the stony FEMALE RESERVATIONS CLERK.

DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
Be quiet, be calm... name, rank,
and press affiliation, nothing
else...

DUKE moves ANOTHER RIGID STEP CLOSER to the desk -- the
tension almost snapping him in two.  GONZO's FLAPPING
AROUND -- absolutely no success.

Something catches DUKE's eye... He REMAINS ROOTED -- his
eyes turning to the VEGETAL PAISLEY PATTERNS ON THE CARPET
WHICH ARE SHIFTING -- UNDULATING.  THE CARPET PATTERNS ARE
INEXORABLY CREEPING UP THE WALLS...

DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
...ignore this terrible drug,
pretend it's not happening...

The LAST PEOPLE leave -- with A FINAL, STIFF MOVE, DUKE
comes face to face with the RESERVATIONS CLERK... AND
EXPLODES!

DUKE
HI THERE.  MY NAME... AH, RAOUL
DUKE... ON... ON THAT LIST, THAT'S
FOR SURE.  FREE LUNCH, FINAL
WISDOM, TOTAL COVERAGE... WHY NOT?
I HAVE MY ATTORNEY WITH ME, AND I
REALIZE OF COURSE...

As DUKE stares at her, BABBLING, her FACE BEGINS TO MORPH.
He tries to stop it happening by TALKING FASTER.

DUKE
... THAT HIS NAME IS NOT ON THE
LIST, BUT WE MUST HAVE THAT SUITE.
YES.  JUST CHECK THE LIST AND
YOU'LL SEE.  DON'T WORRY.  WHAT'S
THE SCORE HERE?  WHAT'S NEXT?

DUKE sags -- grips the desk -- WHITE KNUCKLES.

18.


RESERVATIONS CLERK
(hands him an envelope)
Your suite's not ready yet.  But
there's somebody looking for you.

Her face is CHANGING -- SWELLING -- PULSING...

DUKE
(shouts)
NO!  WHY?  WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING
YET!

The FACE OF THE RESERVATIONS CLERK TURNS GREEN & GROWS FANGS.
DEADLY POISON!  DUKE LUNGES BACK at GONZO, who GRIPS his arm
intensely -- REACHES OUT to take the ENVELOPE.

GONZO
I can handle this.  This man has a
bad heart, but I have plenty of
medicine.  My name is Dr. Gonzo.
Prepare our suite at once.  We'll
be in the bar.

GONZO manoeuvres DUKE away from the desk.  DUKE looks
back -- the RESERVATIONS CLERKS is now a MORAY EEL -- green
jowls and fangs.

INT. NAUTICAL BAR - DAY

The bar -- OILY PEOPLE -- quiet music -- nautical theme.
DUKE and GONZO at the bar, a marlin spike hanging on the
wall behind them.  DUKE has turned to stone...

GONZO
(to the bartender)
Two Cuba Libres with beer and
mescal on the side.
(opens the envelope)
Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us
in a room on the twelfth floor?

DUKE
Lacerda?

DUKE (V/O)
I couldn't remember.  The name rang
a bell, but I couldn't concentrate.
Terrible things were happening all
around us...

DUKE is staring -- RAPT -- TERRIFIED.  BLOOD FLOWS FREELY
onto the floor.  DUKE keeps his voice low.

19.


DUKE
Order some golf shoes.  Otherwise,
we'll never get out of this place
alive.  It's impossible to walk in
this muck -- no footing at all...

DUKE looks up -- GONZO has disappeared.

DUKE looks around him -- the entire room has TRANSFORMED
into a ROOM FILLED WITH REPTILES IN CLOTHES, DRINKING AND
GNAWING AT ONE ANOTHER.

DUKE (V/O)
I was right in the middle of a
fucking reptile zoo.  And somebody
was giving booze to these goddamn
things!  It won't be long before
they tear us to shreds!

GONZO IS SUDDENLY BACK -- AT DUKE'S SHOULDER.

GONZO
If you think we're in trouble now
wait until you see what's happening
in the elevators.

GONZO removes his sunshades and we see he's been crying...
as he speaks he seems to be floating.  Duke struggles to
keep him in his line of vision.

GONZO
I just went upstairs to see this
man Lacerda.  I told him I knew
what he was up to...
(GONZO rallies --
turns fierce)
He says he's a photographer!  But
when I mentioned Savage Henry he
freaked!  He knows we're onto him!

DUKE
But what about our room?  And the
golf shoes?

A GROUP OF REPTILES AT A TABLE ACROSS THE ROOM stares at
them, BLOOD DRIPPING FROM THEIR FANGS.

DUKE (CONT'D)
(grabbing GONZO
trying to hold him still)
Holy shit!  Look at that bunch over
there!  They've spotted us!

20.


Cut to wider shot -- DUKE is holding on to a man standing
next to him at the bar.  The room has returned to normality.
GONZO is sitting in his original position.

GONZO
(downs his drink --
gets up)
That's the press table.  Where you
have to sign in for our credentials.
Shit, let's get it over with.  You
handle that, and I'll check on the
room.

DUKE
No, no.  Don't leave me!

Black screen.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - DUSK

A TELEVISION shows the NIGHTLY NEWS.  A BUDDHIST MONK,
protesting the war, sets himself on fire.  A very nervous
BELL BOY is laying out GONZO's order.  A marlin spike is on
the floor next to DUKE.

BELL BOY
Four club sandwiches, four shrimp
cocktails.

DUKE
There's a big... machine in the
sky... some kind of electric snake...

DUKE is curled by the window -- MESMERIZED by an unseen neon
sign outside the window.  His eyes fill with a million
colored lights.

BELL BOY
... a quart of rum...

DUKE
... coming straight at us.

GONZO
Shoot it.

DUKE
Not yet.  I want to study its habits.

BELL BOY
... and nine fresh grapefruit.

21.


GONZO
Vitamin C.  We'll need all we can
get.

GONZO sees the BELL BOY out the door -- turns and lays into
DUKE.

GONZO
Look, you've got to stop this talk
about snakes and leeches and
lizards and that stuff.  It's
making me sick!

DUKE stares -- hears the drone of B52 BOMBERS...

On TV: The LAOS INVASION -- A SERIES OF HORRIFYING
DISASTERS -- EXPLOSIONS AND TWISTED WRECKAGE.

Newsreel footage of MAI LAI MASSACRE and the LIEUTENANT
CALLEY court-martial.

DUKE
What are you talking about?

GONZO
You bastard!  They'll never let us
back in that place.  I leave you
alone for three minutes and you
start waving that goddamn marlin
spike around -- yelling about
reptiles!  You scared the shit out
of those people!  They were ready
to call the cops.  Hell, the only
reason they gave us press passes
was to get you out of there...

A knock at the door.  DUKE and GONZO break out in a sweat.

DUKE
Oh my God!  Who's that?!

GONZO STICKS HIS GUN IN HIS WAISTBAND -- opens the door to
LACERDA -- BOUNCING WITH PUPPY DOG ENTHUSIASM.  GONZO stares
at a man he instantly hates -- watches him with deep
suspicion.

LACERDA
Duke?  I'm Lacerda your photographer.
Got your press passes?  Good, good.
Too bad you missed the bikes
checking in.  My, what a sight!

DUKE watches the B-52S DROP THEIR BOMB LOADS.

22.


Looking down to the thick, patterned carpet, DUKE sees the
BOMBS EXPLODE like vicious flowers.

DUKE looks up: LACERDA is a war photographer -- bruised,
filthy and blood spattered.  LACERDA approaches him --
talking a foreign language.

LACERDA
Husquavarnas.  Yamahas.  Kawaskis.
Maicos.  Pursang.  Swedish Fireballs.
Couple of Triumphs, here and there
a CZ.  All very fast.  What a race
it's gonna be.

DUKE screws up his eyes -- WILLS NORMALITY BACK.  LACERDA is
now just a keen photographer.L

LACERDA
Well, we start at dawn.  Get a good
night's sleep.  I know I will.

And with a cheerful wave, he's gone.  DUKE is in shock.

DUKE
(weakly)
That's good...

GONZO
I think he's lying to us.  I could
see it in his eyes.

DUKE
(even weaker)
They'll probably have a big net for
us when we show up.

DUKE's attention returns to the devastation on the TV...

GONZO
Turn that shit off!

GONZO kills the TV.

Black screen.

DUKE (V/O)
Never lose sight of the primary
responsibility.  Cover the story.
But what was the story?  Nobody had
bothered to say.

23.


EXT. DESERT - DAWN

Against A BIG ORANGE SUN, on a concrete slab, MEN FIRE
SHOTGUNS into the dawn sky.  Clay pigeons shatter.  The Mint
Gun Club.

Next to them, MOTORCYCLES REV -- preparing for the MINT 400
RACE: A hundred BIKERS, MECHANICS and assorted MOTORSPORT
TYPES milling around in the pit area; taping headlights,
topping off oil in the forks, last minute bolt tightening.

DUKE wanders through.

DUKE (V/O)
The racers were ready at dawn.
Very tense.  But the race didn't
start until nine so we had three
long hours to kill.

A sign by a long trestle table: "KOFFEE & DONUTS." DUKE
walks past -- ignoring the SMILING LADY behind the stall.

DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
Those of us who had been up all
night were in no mood for coffee
and donuts.  We wanted strong drink.
We were, after all, the Absolute
Cream of the National Sporting
Press and we were gathered here, in
Las Vegas, for a very special
assignment.  And when it comes to
things like this you don't fool
around.

INT. RACE BAR TENT - DAY

A real pit of iniquity.  Slot Machines.  Crap tables.  Smoke.
Drunken shouting.  The absolute cream of the NATIONAL
SPORTING PRESS.

DUKE is at the bar, engaged in drunken conversation with a
LIFE REPORTER...showing him his notebook.

DUKE
See..."Kill the body and the head
will die"... the Frazier/Ali fight...

MAGAZINE REPORTER
A proper end to the 60's... Ali
beaten by a human hamburger!

DUKE
And both Kennedy's murdered by
mutants.

24.


A SHOUT goes up from outside.  The sound of engines revving.

REPORTER
That's it!  They're starting!

In a sudden rush the PRESS CROWD make for the door taking
DUKE with them.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

MOTORCYCLES REV -- tension builds...

A flag goes down.  The CROWD cheers.  The MOTORCYCLES ROAR
AWAY.  A great cloud of dust goes up -- obscuring the RACERS
as they disappear into the desert...

A moment...

REPORTER
Well, that's that.  They'll be back
in an hour or so.  Let's go back to
the bar.

The CROWD turns and streams back into the tent.

INT. RACE BAR TENT - DAY

DUKE heads for the bar along with the REST.  It's packed.
Drinks are ordered.

A shout from outside the tent goes up:

VOICE OFF
Group 2!

The CROWD rushes for the door.  DUKE gets swept along.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

MOTORCYCLES REV.  A flag goes down.  The CROWD cheers.  The
MOTORCYCLES ROAR AWAY.  Another great cloud of dust goes up...

The CROWD head back for the bar.

INT. RACE BAR TENT - DAY

The CROWD surge back to the bar.

VOICE OFF
Group 3!

This time DUKE fights his way free of the CROWD.

25.


DUKE (V/O)
There was something like 190 more
bikes waiting to start.  They were
due to go off 10 at a time every 2
minutes.

DUKE hits the bar.

DUKE
Beer!

A middle-aged HOODLUM in a T-shirt booms up to the bar.

HOODLUM
God damn!  What day is this --
Saturday?

DUKE
More like Sunday.

HOODLUM
Hah!  That's a bitch, ain't it?
Last night I was home in Long Beach
and somebody said they were runnin'
the Mint 400 today, so I says to my
old lady, "Man, I'm goin'." So she
gives me a lot of crap about it, so
I start slappin' her around, and
the next thing you know two guys I
never seen before are beating me
stupid.

VOICE OFF
Group 4!

Outside, another batch of motorcycles roar away -- kicking
up more clouds of dust.

HOODLUM
Then they gave me ten bucks, put me
on a bus, and when I woke up here I
was in downtown Vegas, and for a
minute all I could think was, "O
Jesus, who's divorcing me this
time?" But then I remembered, by
God!  I was here for the Mint 400.
And, man, I tell you, it's wonderful
to be here.  Just wonderful to be
here with you people.

A silence.  A MAGAZINE REPORTER lunges across the bar --
grabs the BARTENDER.

26.


MAGAZINE REPORTER
Senzaman wassyneeds!

DUKE
(smacks the bar with
his palm)
Hell yes!  Bring us ten!

VOICE OFF
Group 5!

MAGAZINE REPORTER
(screams)
I'll back it!
(slides off his stool
to the floor)


Outside, motorcycles roar away.  The dust cloud billows into
the tent -- getting denser.

MAGAZINE REPORTER (CONT'D)
(on the floor)
This is a magic moment in sport!
It may never come again!  I once
did the Triple Crown, but it was
nothing like this.

A FROG-EYED WOMAN claws at the MAGAZINE REPORTER, tries to
haul him up.

FROG-EYED WOMAN
Please stand up!  You're a
correspondent for a major national
magazine who's name we can't get
clearance for!  Please!  You'd be a
very handsome man if you'd just
stand up!

MAGAZINE REPORTER
Listen, madam.  I'm damn near
intolerably handsome down here
where I am.  You'd go crazy if I
stood up!

A feverishly eager LACERDA appears out of the dust cloud, 3
cameras slung round his neck.

LACERDA
Club soda, please.

FROG-EYED WOMAN
(to MAGAZINE REPORTER)
Please!  I love Life!

27.


LACERDA
(to DUKE)
Man, it's great out there!

DUKE
Lunatics.

LACERDA grins.

VOICE OFF
Group 6!

LACERDA
Meet you outside!

LACERDA downs his drink -- hurries out through the crowd and
out into the cloud of dust.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Nothing.  Except for a THICK CLOUD OF DUST.

Barely visible, a motorcycle comes speeding into the pits.
The RIDER staggers off his bike.  The PIT CREW gas it up and
sends it back with a FRESH RIDER.

DUKE watches him disappear back into the dust cloud.

DUKE (V/O)
By 10 they were spread out all over
the course.  It was no longer a
race, now it was an Endurance
Contest.  The idea of trying to
"cover this race" in any
conventional press sense was absurd.

A HORN HONKS.  A shiny BLACK BRONCO with DRIVER.  LACERDA
hangs out of the window.

LACERDA
It's great, isn't it?!  Jump in!

DUKE gets into the Bronco and they head into the DUST CLOUD.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

IN THE BRONCO.

DUKE hangs on with his beer.  Nothing all around but the
HUGE IMPENETRABLE CLOUD OF DUST.  LACERDA snaps madly away
at nothing at all!

28.


LACERDA
I'll just keep trying different
combos of film and lenses till I
find one that works in this dust!

The SOUND OF MOTORCYCLES RACING...

We hear music and voices singing:

BATTLE HYMN
"...As we go marching on
When I reach my final campground,
in
that land beyond the sun,
And the Great Commander asks me..."
[What did he ask you, Rusty?]
"Did you fight or did you run?"

A moment later, the Bronco races out of the dust.  DUKE
coughs, chokes, drinks beer.

BATTLE HYMN
(continuing)
[And what did you tell them,
Rusty?]
"We responded to their rifle fire
with everything we had..."

The sound of gun shots...

A DUNE BUGGY races toward them, loaded down with THREE
RETIRED PETTY OFFICERS, DRUNK AS HELL.  The radio blares:
"THE BATTLE HYMN OF LIEUTENANT CALLEY."

The dune buggy is COVERED WITH OMINOUS SYMBOLS: SCREAMING
EAGLES CARRYING AMERICAN FLAGS IN THEIR CLAWS.  A slant-eyed
Snake being chopped to bits by a buzz-saw made of stars and
stripes.  A MACHINE GUN MOUNT on the passenger side.  They
yell over the roaring engines.

DUNE BUGGY DRIVER
Where's the damn race?

DUKE
Beats me.  We're just good patriotic
Americans like yourself.

DUKE gives DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #2 A NICE BIG GRIN.  In
response, the PASSENGER #2 narrows his eyes -- tightens his
grip on an automatic weapon.

DUNE BUGGY DRIVER
(suspiciously)
What outfit you fellas with?

29.


DUKE
The sporting press.  We're
friendlies.  Hired geeks.

The DRIVER and DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #2 exchange looks.

DUKE
If you want a good chase, you
should get after that skunk from
CBS News up ahead in the black jeep.
He's the man responsible for that
book, THE SELLING OF THE PENTAGON.

DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #1
HOT DAMN!

DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #2
A black jeep, you say?

And they ROAR away.

DUKE
Take me back to the pits.

LACERDA
No, no -- we have to go on.  We
need total coverage.

DUKE gets out of the Bronco.

DUKE
You're fired.

After a moment's hesitation, LACERDA and the BRONCO driver
roar away leaving DUKE alone in the cloud of dust.

DUKE (V/O)
It was time.  I felt, for an
Agonizing Reappraisal of the whole
scene.  The race was definitely
under way.  I had witnessed the
start; I was sure of that much.
But what now?

EXT. LAS VEGAS STREETS - NIGHT

MUSIC PUMPS OUT.  CRUISING IN THE RED SHARK IN VEGAS.  THE
SKY SWIRLS WITH MILLIONS OF NEON LIGHTS CHASING EACH OTHER
IN BAROQUE PATTERNS ACROSS GIGANTIC HOTEL SIGNS.  PSYCHEDELIC
LIGHT SHOWS TO LURE AND DERANGE THE INNOCENT.  CITY OF LOST
SOULS.

30.


DUKE
Turn up the radio!  Turn up the
tape machine!  Roll the windows
down.  Let's taste this cool desert
wind!  Aaah, yes!  This is what
it's all about!

DUKE, beer in hand, drives -- a big smile for the world.
GONZO scans The Vegas Visitor.

DUKE (V/O)
Total control now.  Tooling along
the main drag on a Saturday night
in Vegas, two good old boys in a
fire apple red convertible...
stoned, ripped, twisted... Good
people!

GONZO
How about "Nickel Nick's Slot
Arcade?" "Hot Slots," that sounds
heavy.  Twenty-nine cent hotdogs...

DUKE
Look, what are we doing here?  Are
we here to entertain ourselves, or
to do the job?

GONZO
To do the job, of course.  Here we
go... a Crab Louie and quart of
muscatel for twenty dollars!

The Shark hits a bump.

GONZO
As your attorney I advise you to
drive over to the Tropicana and
pick up on Guy Lombardo.  He's in
the Blue Room with his Royal
Canadians.

They hit another bump.

DUKE
Why?

GONZO
Why what?

CUT to wide shot.  They are DRIVING AROUND IN CIRCLES in a
large casino parking lot, bumping over the dividers.

31.


DUKE
Why should I pay out my hard-earned
dollars to watch a fucking corpse.
I don't know about you, but in my
line of business it's important to
be Hep.

EXT. DESERT ROOM HOTEL - NIGHT

TWO BIG SCREAMING FACES.

DOORMAN #1
What the hell are you doing?!

DOORMAN #2
You can't park here!

DUKE
Why not?  Is this not a reasonable
place to park?

Reveal the RED SHARK parked on the sidewalk in front of the
Desert Inn.  TWO DOORMEN loom over the car hood.  The
MARQUEE says: TONIGHT.  DEBBIE REYNOLDS.

GONZO leaps from the car, waving a five-dollar bill at the
DOORMAN.

GONZO
We want this car parked!  We drove
all the way from L.A. for this show.
We're friends of Debbie's.

A pause, then... the DOORMAN pockets the bill, hands them a
parking stub.  DUKE and GONZO hurry into the hotel.

INT. DESERT FROM HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

DUKE and GONZO walk through the lobby.  Black, mirrored,
sleek, classy.

DUKE
Holy shit!  They almost had us
there!  That was quick thinking.

GONZO
What do you expect?  I'm your
attorney.  You owe me five bucks.
I want it now.

DUKE shrugs and hands over the $5.

32.


DUKE (V/O)
This was Bob Hope's turf.  Frank
Sinatra's.  Spiro Agnew's.  It
seemed inappropriate to be haggling
about nickel/dime bribes for the
parking lot attendant.

A WINE-COLORED TUXEDO stops them at the entrance to the
ballroom.

WINE-COLORED TUXEDO
Sorry, full house.

GONZO
Goddamnit, we drove all the way
from L.A.

WINE-COLORED TUXEDO
I said there are no seats left...
at any price.

GONZO
Fuck seats!  We're old friends of
Debbie's.  I used to romp with her.

GONZO and the WINE-COLORED TUXEDO get into an ugly arm-
waving negotiation.

DUKE (V/O)
After a lot of bad noise, he let us
in for nothing provided we would
stand quietly at the back and not
smoke.

As DUKE and GONZO disappear through the door we can hear the
orchestra blasting out a HIGHLY BLANDIZED "SGT. PEPPER'S
LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND."

A beat.

The door flies open and BOUNCERS manhandle DUKE and GONZO
out.  Despite the rough treatment they're both SCREECHING
WITH LAUGHTER.

GONZO
Jesus creeping shit!

DUKE
(tears streaming)
Did the mescaline just kick in?  Or
was that Debbie Reynolds in a
silver Afro wig?!

33.


GONZO
(in hysteria)
We wandered into a fucking time
capsule!

EXT. LAS VEGAS STREETS - NIGHT

DUKE DRIVES FAST into the night.  They're both LAUGHING
HYSTERICALLY.

DUKE
(in hysteria)
We wandered into a fucking time
capsule!

THEN... GONZO finds a TINY TEAR IN HIS JACKET...

GONZO
What's this?...

GONZO is instantly MOROSE.

GONZO
That scum...

GONZO twists round in the car -- SCREAMS back into the night.

GONZO
SCUM!  I know where you live!  I'll
find you and burn down your fucking
house!

EXT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS - NIGHT

A hundred foot high neon clown: BAZOOKO CIRCUS.

The RED SHARK pulls up beneath the sign.

DUKE
This is the place.  They'll never
fuck with us here.

GONZO
Where's the ether?  This mescaline
isn't working.

EXT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS CASINO - NIGHT

Into the GLARING, CHASING LIGHTS of the entrance canopy
steps DUKE in EC/U holding a KLEENEX SOAKED IN ETHER TO HIS
NOSE.

34.


DUKE (V/O)
Ah, devil ether.  It makes you
behave like the village drunkard in
some early Irish novel... total
loss of all basic motor skills;
blurred vision, no balance, numb
tongue --
(throws away kleenex)
The mind recoils in horror, unable
to communicate with the spinal
column.  Which is interesting,
because you can actually watch
yourself behaving in this terrible
way, but you can't control it.

DUKE and GONZO approach the entrance with elaborate care-
taking one step at a time -- trying to keep ahead of the drug.

DUKE (V/O)
You approach the turnstiles and
know that when you get there, you
have to give the man two dollars or
he won't let you inside... but when
you get there, everything goes wrong.

THE ETHER KICKS IN:

DUKE and GONZO BOUNCE off the walls, CRASH into OLD LADIES,
GIGGLE HELPLESSLY as they try to pay -- HANDS FLAPPING
CRAZILY, unable to get money out of their pockets.

DUKE (V/O)
Some angry Rotarian shoves you and
you think: What's happening here?
What's going on?  Then you hear
yourself mumbling.

DUKE
(mumbling)
Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of
mine.  Watch out!... Why money?  My
name is Brinks; I was born... Born?

GONZO
Get sheep over side... women and
children to armored car... orders
from Captain Zeep.

The ATTENDANTS indulgently escort them through the TURNSTILES.

35.


DUKE (V/O)
Ether is the perfect drug for Las
Vegas.  In this town they love a
drunk.  Fresh meat.  So they put us
through the turnstiles and turned
us loose inside.

INT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS CASINO - NIGHT

Flames shoot up from below the casino.  Above, a HIGH WIRE
ACT with FOUR MUZZLED WOLVERINES, SIX NYMPHET SISTERS FROM
SAN DIEGO, TWO SILVER PAINTED POLACK BROTHERS, and THREE
KOREAN KITTENS.

The WOLVERINE chases a NYMPHET through the air.  TWO POLACKS
swing at it from opposite sides and they are instantly
locked in a death battle.

All plummet to the nets suspended over the GAMBLING TABLES
and SLOT MACHINES.  No one looks up.  The GAMBLERS REMAIN
INTENT ON THE SPINNING ROULETTE WHEEL, THE TURN OF THE CARD,
THE ROLL OF A DICE.

DUKE (V/O)
Bazooko Circus is what the whole
hep world would be doing Saturday
night if the Nazis had won the war.
This was the Sixth Reich.

Something causes DUKE to look down.  A dwarf carrying drinks
on a tray is tugging DUKE's pants leg trying to get him to
move out of the way.

DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
A drug person can learn to cope
with things like seeing their dead
grandmother crawling up their leg
with a knife in her teeth but,
nobody should be asked to handle
this trip.

GONZO and DUKE go upstairs walking past funhouse booths.
One of them is manned by an orangutan in costume.  A
FAIRGROUND BARKER grabs DUKE.

FAIRGROUND BARKER
Stand in front of this fantastic
machine, my friend.  For just 99
cents your likeness will appear 200
hundred feet tall on a screen above
downtown Las Vegas.

On a TV monitor a 200 FOOT HIGH DRUNKARD looms over the Las
Vegas skyline screaming OBSCENITIES.

36.


FAIRGROUND BARKER
99 cents more for a voice message.
Say whatever you want, fella.
They'll hear you, don't worry about
that.  Remember, you'll be 200 feet
tall!

ANOTHER BARKER
Step right up!  Shoot the pasties
off the nipples of this ten-foot
bull-dyke and win a cotton candy
goat!

INT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS REVOLVING MERRY-GO-ROUND BAR - NIGHT

DUKE and GONZO sit on the revolving platform.  GONZO
stares -- glassy eyed -- coming apart.

GONZO
I hate to say this, but this place
is getting to me.  I think I'm
getting The Fear.

DUKE
Nonsense.  We came here to find the
American Dream, and now we're right
in the vortex you want to quit.
You must realize that we've found
the Main Nerve.

GONZO
That's what gives me The Fear.

DUKE
Look over there.  Two women fucking
a Polar Bear.

GONZO
Please, don't tell me those things...
Not now.
(signals the waitress
for two Wild Turkeys)
This is my last drink.  How much
money can you lend me?

DUKE
Not much.  Why?

GONZO
I have to go.

DUKE
GO?

37.


GONZO
Yes.  Leave the country.  Tonight.

DUKE
Calm down.  You'll be straight in a
few hours.

GONZO
No.  This is serious.  One more
hour in this town and I'll kill
somebody!

DUKE
OK.  I'll lend you some money.
Let's go outside and see how much
we have left.

GONZO
Can we make it?

DUKE
That depends on how many people we
fuck with between here and the door.

GONZO
I want to leave fast.

DUKE
OK.  Lets pay this bill and get up
very slowly.  It's going to be a
long walk.
(signals waitress who
comes over)


GONZO
(suddenly to waitress)
Do they pay you to screw that bear?

WAITRESS
What?

DUKE
He's just kidding.
(to GONZO)
Come on, Doc -- lets go downstairs
and gamble.

GONZO trembles with fear -- walks to the edge of the
turntable.

GONZO
When does this thing stop?

38.


DUKE
It won't stop.  It's not ever going
to stop.

DUKE carefully steps off the turntable.

GONZO, eyes staring blindly ahead, squiting in fear and
confusion, rooted to the spot, is carried away.

DUKE
Don't move you'll come around.

DUKE reaches out to grab GONZO, who jumps back -- keeps
going around.

The BARTENDER narrows his eyes at them.

DUKE steps onto the merry-go-round -- hurries round the
bar -- approaching GONZO from the blind side and shoves
GONZO from behind.  GONZO goes down with a hellish scream.
DUKE approaches him with his hands in the air.  Smiling.

DUKE
You fell.  Let's go.

GONZO refuses to move and stands tense, fists clenched,
looking for somebody to hit...an old woman perhaps?

DUKE (CONT'D)
OK.  You stay here and go to jail.
I'm leaving.

DUKE walks fast towards the stairs.  GONZO catches up with
him.

GONZO
Did you see that?  Some sonofabitch
kicked me in the back.

DUKE
Probably the bartender.  He wanted
to stomp you for what you said to
the waitress.

GONZO
Good God!  Let's get out of here!
Where's the elevator?

DUKE
(turning him in the
opposite direction)
Don't go near that elevator.
That's just what they want us to
do... trap us in a steel box and
take us down to the basement.

39.


EXT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS CASINO - NIGHT

DUKE and GONZO stumble out of the entrance.

DUKE
Don't run.  They'd like any excuse
to shoot us.

GONZO
(in an extended fall)
You drive!  I think there's
something wrong with me.

INT. MINT HOTEL CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THEIR SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE AND GONZO RUN MADLY DOWN THE CORRIDOR... DUKE TAKING
CARE NOT TO STEP ON THE PATTERNED PART OF THE CARPET.

GONZO STRUGGLES with the key in the lock.

GONZO
Those bastards have changed the
lock on us.  They probably searched
the room.  Jesus, we're finished!

The door SUDDENLY SWINGS OPEN.  DUKE AND GONZO fall inside.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

GONZO
Bolt everything!  Use all chains!

DUKE locks the door.  The suite is crowded with ROOM SERVICE
GOODIES.  DUKE turns to see GONZO staring at two hotel room
keys.  EVERYTHING STOPS.

GONZO
Where did this one come from?

DUKE snatches a key.

DUKE
That's Lacerda's room.

GONZO smiles a slow smile...

GONZO
Yeah... I thought we might need it...

DUKE
What for?

GONZO snatches the key back.

40.


GONZO
Let's go up there and blast him out
of bed with the fire hose.

DUKE
No, we should leave the poor
bastard alone.  I get the feeling
that he's avoiding us for some
reason.

GONZO
Don't kid yourself.  That Portuguese
son of a bitch is dangerous.  He's
watching us like a hawk.

DUKE
He told me he was turning in early...

GONZO utters an anguished cry -- slaps the wall with both
hands.

GONZO
That dirty bastard!  I knew it!
He's got hold of my woman!

DUKE
(laughing)
That little blonde groupie with the
film crew?  You think he sodomized
her?

GONZO
That's right, laugh about it!  You
goddamn honkies are all the same!

GONZO SLASHES A GRAPEFRUIT with a HUGE RAZOR SHARP HUNTING
KNIFE.  DUKE blanches.

DUKE
Where'd you get that knife?

GONZO SLICES THE GRAPEFRUIT -- MANIACAL.

GONZO
Room service sent it up.  I wanted
something to cut the limes.

GONZO SLICES THE GRAPEFRUIT -- INTO EIGHTHS!

DUKE
What limes?

GONZO SLICES -- SIXTEENTHS!

41.


GONZO
They didn't have any.  They don't
grow in the desert.

SLICE!  SLICE!  SLICE!

GONZO
That dirty toad bastard!  I knew I
should have taken him out when I
had the chance.  Now he has her.

SLICE!  SLICE!  SLICE!  GONZO SLASHES INSANELY!

DUKE watches -- straight-faced.

DUKE (V/O)
I remember the girl.  We'd had a
problem with her in the elevator a
few hours earlier: my attention had
made a fool of himself.

INT. ELEVATOR - DAY (FLASHBACK)

An elevator door opens to reveal the SMILING FACES OF
LACERDA, THE BLONDE TV REPORTER AND HER CREW.

DUKE and GONZO stagger in.

LACERDA drops his smile.  He's standing beside the BLONDE TV
REPORTER.  A trembling GONZO moonily turns his eyes onto her.

BLONDE TV REPORTER
(to Gonzo)
You must be a rider.  What class
are you in?

GONZO
Class?  What the fuck do you mean?

BLONDE TV REPORTER
What do you ride?  We're filming
the race for a TV series -- maybe
we can use you.

GONZO
Use me?

DUKE (V/O)
Mother of God, I thought.  Here it
comes.

GONZO is TREMBLING BADLY.  There's a moment of uncomfortable
silence.

42.


GONZO
(suddenly shouting)
I ride the BIG ONES!  The really
BIG fuckers!

GONZO shows his teeth to LACERDA.  DUKE laughs trying to
defuse the scene.

DUKE
The Vincent Black Shadow.  We're
with the Factory Team.

TV CAMERAMAN
Bullshit.

GONZO stills -- becomes dangerous -- zeros in on the TV
CAMERAMAN -- groin to groin...

GONZO
Wait a minute, pardon me lady, but
I think there's some kind of
ignorant chicken-sucker in this car
who needs his face cut open.  You
cheap honky faggots!  Which one of
you wants to get cut?!

DEAD SILENCE.

Ding!  The elevator door opens, but nobody moves.  The door
closes.

Next floor.  Ding!  The door opens again.  A middle-aged
couple start to get in.  Change their minds.  The door closes.

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

DUKE and GONZO run down the corridor.  GONZO LAUGHS WILDLY.

GONZO
Spooked!  They were spooked!  Like
rats in a death cage!

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - DAY

DUKE and GONZO CRASH into their hotel suite -- BOLT THE DOOR.
GONZO stops laughing.

GONZO
Goddamn.  It's serious now.  That
girl understood.  She fell in love
with me.

END FLASHBACK.

43.


INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

SLICE!  SLICE!  SLICE!  GONZO with the BIG HUNTING KNIFE --
sliced grapefruit segments everywhere.

GONZO
Let's go up there and castrate that
fucker!

GONZO pauses -- A MAD THOUGHT -- turns to DUKE.

GONZO
(squinting suspiciously)
Have you made a deal with him?  Did
you put him on to her?

DUKE
(backing slowly
towards the door)
Look you better put that blade away
and get your head straight.  I have
to put the car in the lot.

DUKE (V/O)
One of the things you learn, after
years of dealing with drug people,
is that you can turn your back on a
person, but never turn your back on
a drug.  Especially when it's
waving a razor-sharp hunting knife
in your eyes.

INT. CASINO/LOBBY MINT HOTEL

The MAGAZINE REPORTER is on the telephone.

MAGAZINE REPORTER
Las Vegas at dawn.  The racers are
still asleep, the dust is still on
the desert, fifty thousand dollars
in prize money, slumbers darkly in
the office safe at Del Webb's
fabulous Mint Hotel...

DUKE walks past the REPORTER -- into THE CASINO, THE SAD,
MEAGRE CROWDS AROUND THE CRAP TABLES.  No joy.  DUKE watches.

DUKE (V/O)
Who are these people?  These faces!
Where do they come from?  They look
like caricatures of used car
dealers from Dallas.
(MORE)

44.


DUKE (V/O; CONT'D)
And, sweet Jesus, there are a hell
of a lot of them at four-thirty on
a Monday morning.  Still humping
the American dream, that vision of
the big winner somehow emerging
from the last minute predawn chaos
of a stale Vegas casino.

DUKE stops at the Money Wheel, puts down a two dollar bill
on a number, the wheel turns, he loses.

DUKE
You bastards!

DUKE (V/O)
No.  Calm down.  Learn to ENJOY
losing.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE walks back into the room.  We hear the LOUD STRAINS OF
THREE DOG NIGHT'S "JOY TO THE WORLD."

He walks to the bathroom and opens the door.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE BATHROOM - NIGHT

Submerged in green water, GONZO WALLOWS in the steaming tub.
Soap labels and grapefruit rinds float on the surface.  A
large empty pack of Neutrogena soap lies on the floor.  The
shower is on -- the tub overflowing.  THE TAPE RECORDER
PLAYS, from where it's plugged into the razor socket over
the sink.

DUKE turns off the shower -- notices a HUGE HUNK OF CHEWED
UP WHITE BLOTTER.

DUKE
You ate ALL THIS ACID?

No answer.

DUKE
(turning down the volume)
You evil son of a bitch.  You
better hope there's some Thorazine
in that bag, because if there's
not, you're in bad trouble.

GONZO
Music!  Turn it up.  Put that tape
on.

45.


DUKE
What tape?

GONZO
Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit."
I want a rising sound.

DUKE
You're doomed.  I'm leaving here in
two hours and then they're going to
come up here and beat the mortal
shit out of you with big saps.
Right there in that tub.

GONZO
I dig my own graves.  Green water
and the White Rabbit.  Put it on.

DUKE
OK.  But do me one last favor, will
you.  Can you give me two hours?
That's all I ask -- just two hours
to sleep before tomorrow.  I
suspect it's going to be a very
difficult day.

He switches on the tape. "WHITE RABBIT" begins to build.

GONZO
(coolly)
Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll
give you all the time you need, at
my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but
you'll be wanting a cushion, so,
why don't you just lay one of those
$100 bills down there beside the
radio, and fuck off?

DUKE
How about a check?

GONZO
Whatever's right.

DUKE moves the radio as far from the tub as he can and
leaves, closing the door behind him.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE goes across to the sofa and crashes -- exhausted.
Suddenly a great ripping and crashing noise in the bathroom.

GONZO (V/O)
Help!  You bastard!  I need help!

46.


DUKE JUMPS up -- crosses to the bathroom door, muttering.

DUKE
Shit, he's killing himself!

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

DUKE RUSHES IN.  GONZO flails -- trying to reach the radio
with the shower curtain pole which he has ripped from its
mounts.

GONZO
(snarling)
I want that fucking radio!

DUKE GRABS THE RADIO.

DUKE
Don't touch it!  Get back in that
tub!

GONZO
Back the tape up.  I need it again!
Let it roll!  Just as high as the
fucker can go!  And when it comes
to that fantastic note where the
rabbit bites its own head off, I
want you to THROW THAT FUCKING
RADIO INTO THE TUB WITH ME!

DUKE stares down at GONZO.

DUKE
Not me.  It would blast you through
the wall -- stone dead in ten
seconds and they'd make me explain
it!

GONZO
BULLSHIT!  Don't make me use this.

HIS ARM LASHES OUT OF THE WATER, HOLDING THE KNIFE.

DUKE
Jesus.

GONZO
Do it!  I want to get HIGHER!

DUKE considers this.  He's had enough.

47.


DUKE
Okay.  You're right.  This is
probably the only solution.
(holds the PLUGGED IN
TAPE/RADIO over the tub)
Let me make sure I have it all
lined up.  You want me to throw
this thing into the tub when "WHITE
RABBIT" peaks.  Is that it?

GONZO falls back into the water, smiling gratefully.

GONZO
Fuck yes.  I was beginning to think
I was going to have to go out and
get one of the goddamn maids to do
it.

DUKE
Are you ready?

He switches "WHITE RABBIT" back on.  GONZO HOWLS AND MOANS
AND THRASHES TO THE MUSIC, straining to get over the top.

Meanwhile, DUKE picks up a grapefruit from the sink -- a
good two-pounder, he gets a grip on it... and when "WHITE
RABBIT" peaks... HE HURLS IT INTO THE TUB LIKE A CANNONBALL.

GONZO SCREAMS CRAZILY, THRASHING AND CHURNING -- CAUSING A
TIDAL WAVE.

DUKE JERKS THE RADIO CABLE OUT OF THE SOCKET -- SLAMS OUT OF
THE BATHROOM.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE slumps onto the sofa.

SILENCE.

GONZO RIPS OPEN THE BATHROOM DOOR, his eyes unfocused.  HE
WAVES THE RAZOR SHARP BLADE out in front of him -- LUNGES at
DUKE.  DUKE WHIPS OUT A CAN OF MACE.

DUKE
MACE!  YOU WANT THIS?

GONZO stops -- hisses.

GONZO
You bastard!  You'd do that,
wouldn't you?

48.


DUKE
(laughs)
Why worry?  You'll like it.  Nothing
in the world like a Mace high.
Forty-five minutes on your knees
with the dry heaves...

GONZO
You cheap honky sonofabitch...

DUKE
Why not?  Hell, just a minute ago,
you were asking me to kill you!
And now you want to kill me!  What
I should do, goddamnit, is call the
police!

GONZO
The cops?

DUKE
There's no choice.  I wouldn't dare
go to sleep with you wandering
around with a head full of acid and
wanting to slice me up with that
goddamn knife!

GONZO
(mumbles)
Who said anything about slicing you
up?  I just wanted to carve a
little Z on your forehead.  Nothing
serious.

GONZO shrugs and reaches for a cigarette on top of the TV set.

DUKE
(menaces him with the MACE)
Get back in that tub.  Eat some
reds and try to calm down.  Smoke
some grass, shoot some smack --
shit, do whatever you have to do,
but let me get some rest.

GONZO turns toward the bathroom -- suddenly sad.

GONZO
Hell, yes.  You really need some
sleep.  You have to work.  Goddamn.
What a bummer.  Try to rest.  Don't
let me keep you up.

49.


GONZO shuffles back into the bathroom.  DUKE wedges a chair
up against the bathroom doorknob and puts the mace can next
to the clock.

DUKE turns on the TV.  WHITE NOISE FILLS THE ROOM.  He
collapses onto the sofa and lights up his lightbulb as pipe.

DUKE (V/O)
Ignore the nightmare in the bathroom.
Just another ugly refugee from the
Love Generation.

The WHITE NOISE snow storm on the TV is reflected in his
face.  The camera pulls back revealing THE ENTIRE WALL
BEHIND HIM TO BE SWIRLING WITH THE FIZZING SNOWSTORM PATTERN.

DUKE (V/O)
My attorney had never been able to
accept the notion -- often espoused
by former drug abusers -- that you
can get a lot higher without drugs
than with them.  And neither have
I, for that matter.

The pattern on the wall changes to A 60'S VISCOUS OIL
LIGHTSHOW PATTERN.  With DUKE still sitting in the
foreground, the projected image widens to reveal the interior
of A HAIGHT ASHBURY DANCE HALL full of DANCING PROTO-HIPPIES.

INT. MATRIX CLUB - NIGHT

A slightly YOUNGER DUKE moves through the throng.  All the
action is in a DREAMLIKE SLOW-MOTION.

DUKE (V/O)
I recall one night in the Matrix.
There I was -- a victim of the Drug
Explosion.  A natural street freak,
just eating whatever came by.

A ROAD-PERSON with a big pack on his back is shouting.  The
sound of his voice, like his movements, is in slow-motion.

ROAD-PERSON
Anybody want some L...S...D...?  I
got all the makin's right here.
All I need is a place to cook.

The camera pushes right into the ROAD-PERSON's mouth.

INT. MATRIX MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Still in slow motion, the YOUNGER DUKE is trying to eat a
HUGE SPANSULE OF ACID.  With difficulty.

50.


DUKE (V/O)
I decided to eat only half at first.
Good thinking.  But I spilled the
rest on the sleeve of my red
Pendleton shirt.

DUKE stares at his sleeve, uncertain what to do.  C/U of the
door to the men's room as a MUSICIAN enters speaking in
slow-motion.

MUSICIAN
What's the trouble?

DUKE
(also in slow-motion)
Well, all this white stuff on my
sleeve is LSD.

The MUSICIAN approaches and looks down at DUKE'S arm.  A
long pause.

Cut back to tight shot of door as it opens and a very clean-
cut, PREPPY, STOCKBROKER TYPE enters.  He freezes in horror.
We cut to his POV.  DUKE is standing in the middle of the
men's room with the MUSICIAN hunkered down at his side...
sucking on his sleeve.  A very gross tableau.  The
STOCKBROKER slowly eases out of the room.

DUKE (V/O)
With a bit of luck his life was
ruined -- forever thinking that
just behind some narrow door in all
his favorite bars, men in red
Pendleton shirts are getting
incredible kicks from things he'll
never know.

INT. A BAR - YEARS LATER - NIGHT

The STOCKBROKER LOOKING CONSIDERABLY OLDER sits looking
lost, confused, a nervous wreck.  The image flares out in a
TV white noise snowstorm.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE sits staring at the TV.

51.


DUKE (V/O)
Strange memories on this nervous
night in Las Vegas.
(he gets up, pours
himself a drink)
Has it been five years?  Six?  It
seems like a lifetime -- the kind
of peak that never comes again.
San Francisco in the middle sixties
was a very special time and place
to be a part of.  But no
explanation, no mix of words or
music or memories can touch that
sense of knowing that you were
there and alive in that corner of
time and the world.  Whatever it
meant.

DUKE throws open the curtains.  Light streams in.

EXT. 1965 STOCK FOOTAGE

We are in SAN FRANCISCO.  IMAGES OF THE TIME FLOOD IN.

DUKE (V/O)
THERE WAS MADNESS IN ANY DIRECTION,
AT ANY HOUR... YOU COULD STRIKE
SPARKS ANYWHERE.  THERE WAS A
FANTASTIC UNIVERSAL SENSE THAT
WHATEVER WE WERE DOING WAS RIGHT,
THAT WE WERE WINNING.  AND THAT, I
THINK, WAS THE HANDLE -- THAT SENSE
OF INEVITABLE VICTORY OVER THE
FORCES OF OLD AND EVIL.  NOT IN ANY
MEAN OR MILITARY SENSE; WE DIDN'T
NEED THAT.  OUR ENERGY WOULD SIMPLY
prevail.  We had all the momentum;
we were riding the crest of a high
and beautiful wave...

DUKE'S FACE IS SUFFUSED WITH A SADNESS AND SERENITY WE HAVE
NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

DUKE (V/O)
So now, less than five years later,
you can go up on a steep hill in
Las Vegas and look west, and with
the right kind of eyes you can
almost see the high water mark --
that place where the wave finally
broke and rolled back.

52.


The memories dissolve into the night skyline of Vegas.
Suddenly towering over the casinos is a 200 foot high Nazi
shouting "WOODSTOCK ÜBER ALLES!"

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE closes the curtain.  The room is in darkness again.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - DAWN

A harsh door buzzer.  DUKE jerks awake.  Alone.  Looking
like shit.  Around him is the wreckage of their stay.

DUKE (V/O)
The decision to flee came suddenly.
Or maybe not.

DUKE opens the door to a BELL BOY with a trolley load of
fruit, drinks and flowers... and a smile.

BELL BOY
Room service!

The BELL BOY wheels the trolley across the room -- already
stacked with EVEN MORE BOXES OF GOODIES.

DUKE (V/O)
Maybe I'd planned it all along --
subconsciously waiting for the
right moment.  The bill was a
factor, I think.  Because I had no
money to pay for it.

DUKE slams the door -- starts FRANTICALLY PACKING.

DUKE (V/O)
Our room service tabs had been
running somewhere between $29 and
$36 per hour, for forty-eight
consecutive hours.  Incredible.
How could it happen?

DUKE sees the DISCARDED WRAPPINGS OF EXPENSIVE, HAND TOOLED
LUGGAGE.  A sudden thought.  He rushes to GONZO's room --
empty.  His plastic briefcase remains on the bed...

DUKE (V/O)
But by the time I asked this
question, there was no one around
to answer.

DUKE opens the briefcase -- finds the .357 MAGNUM inside.

53.


DUKE (V/O)
My attorney was gone.  He must have
sensed trouble.

QUICK CUT TO:

EXT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DAY

GONZO WAVES GOODBYE as he boards an airplane with a set of
brand-new fine cowhide luggage.

DUKE (V/O)
Panic.

INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE HOTEL SUITE - DAY

DUKE emerges with his bag and Gonzo's plastic briefcase --
leaves the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door -- checks both
ways, then hurries away down the corridor.

DUKE (V/O)
It crept up my spine like first
rising vibes of an acid frenzy.
All these horrible realities began
to dawn on me.

INT. MINT HOTEL ELEVATOR - DAY

An anxiety ridden DUKE watches the floor numbers as the
elevator descends.  He searches his pockets...

DUKE (V/O)
Here I was, alone in Las Vegas,
with this goddamned incredibly
expensive car, completely twisted
on drugs, no cash, no story for the
magazine.  And on top of everything
else I had a gigantic goddamn hotel
bill to deal with.

DUKE finds a last crumpled $5 bill.

The door opens.  A SECURITY GUARD enters with an OLD LADY IN
HANDCUFFS.

DUKE hides the bill -- crams back into the corner.  Doors
close.

DUKE (V/O)
I didn't even know who had won the
race.  Maybe nobody.

54.


INT. MINT HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

DUKE hurries out of the elevator -- eyes on a hovering
MANAGER.  Past the curious look of the reception CLERK.

DUKE
(muttering to himself)
How would Horatio Alger have
handled this situation?

EXT. MINT HOTEL - DAY

Motoring, DUKE gives his $5 bill to the HOTEL FRONT DOORMAN
with a smile.  The DOORMAN blows a frantic whistle and waves
at the CAR BOY.

DUKE (V/O)
Stay calm.  Stay calm.  I'm a
relatively respectable citizen -- a
multiple felon, perhaps, but
certainly not dangerous.

The CAR BOY pulls up with a screech.  DUKE jumps in.  The
back seat is stacked with bars of Neutrogena, piles of Mint
400 t-shirts, boxes of grapefruit.

DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
Luckily, I had taken the soap and
grapefruit and other luggage out to
the car a few hours earlier.  Now
it was only a matter of slipping
the noose...

DUKE shifts into drive.  Deliverance!

CLERK'S VOICE
MR. DUKE!

DUKE freezes.

CLERK'S VOICE
Mr. Duke!  We've been looking for
you!

DUKE (V/O)
The game was up!  They had me.

DUKE
(to himself)
Well, why not?  Many fine books
have been written in prison.

55.


Resigned, DUKE turns off the ignition.  A young CLERK
arrives breathlessly with a smile and a YELLOW LETTER IN HIS
HAND.

CLERK
Sir?
(thrusts out a TELEGRAM)
This telegram came for you.
Actually, it isn't for you.  It's
for somebody named Thompson, but it
says 'care of Raoul Duke'.  does
that make sense?

DUKE
(barely able to speak)
Yes... It makes sense.

DUKE stuffs the telegram into his top pocket.

The CLERK peers into the car -- sees part of the enormous
stash inside.

CLERK
I checked the register for this man
Thompson.  We don't show him but I
figured he might be part of your
team.

DUKE
He is.  Don't worry, I'll get it to
him.

He fires up the engine -- eases the RED SHARK into low gear.

SECURITY GUARDS are looking across -- sharing a quiet word
or two.

CLERK
What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's
signature on the telegram from Los
Angeles.  When we knew he was right
here in the hotel.

DUKE
You did the right thing.  Never try
to understand a press message.
About half the time we use codes --
especially with Dr. Gonzo.

CLERK
Tell me.  When will the doctor be
awake?

56.


DUKE
(tenses)
Awake?  What do you mean?

DUKE's eyes are on the SECURITY GUARDS -- moving closer.

CLERK
(uncomfortably)
Well... the manager, Mr. Heem,
would like to meet him.  Nothing
unusual.  Mr. Heem likes to meet
all our large accounts... put them
on a personal basis... just a chat
and a handshake, you understand.

DUKE
Of course.  But if I were you, I'd
leave the Doctor alone until after
he's eaten breakfast.  He's a very
crude man.

DUKE edges the car forward, but is stopped by the CLERK.

CLERK
But he will be available?  Perhaps
later this morning?

DUKE
Look.  That telegram was all
scrambled.  It was actually from
Thompson, not to him.  Western
Union must have gotten the names
reversed.  I have to get going.  I
have to get out to the track.

CLERK
There's no hurry!  The race is over!

DUKE
(taking off)
Not for me.

He waves the CLERK off the car -- roars away.

CLERK
Let's have lunch!

DUKE
Righto!

EXT. ROAD OUT OF VEGAS - DAY

DUKE drives the RED SHARK out of Vegas.

57.


A "YOU ARE LEAVING LAS VEGAS" sign flashes past.

Bob Dylan plays: "Memphis Blues Again -- "Aaww, Mama, can
this really by the end...?"

A sign: LOS ANGELES -- 400 miles.

DUKE (V/O)
Jesus, bad waves of paranoia,
madness, fear and loathing --
intolerable vibrations in this
place.  Get out!  The weasels were
closing in.  I could smell the ugly
brutes.  Flee!

DUKE drives fast.

DUKE
Do me one last favor Lord: just
give me five more high-speed hours
before you bring the hammer down;
just let me get rid of this goddamn
car and off of this horrible desert.

A sign flashes "YOU CAN RUN BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE."

A patrol car pulls out behind him, lights flashing.

DUKE (CONT'D)
You evil bastard!  This is your
work!  You'd better take care of
me, Lord... because if you don't
you're going to have me on your
hands.

The patrol car screams after the RED SHARK.

DUKE (V/O)
Few people understand the psychology
of dealing with a Highway Traffic
Cop.  Your normal speeder will
panic and immediately pull over to
the side.  This is wrong.

DUKE floors the gas pedal.

DUKE (V/O)
It arouses contempt in the cop heart.

THE SPEEDOMETER CLIMBS STEADILY.

58.


DUKE (V/O)
Make the bastard chase you.  He
will follow.  But he won't know
what to make of your blinker signal
that says you're about to turn right.

DUKE signals right.  The RED SHARK screams at 120 mph.

DUKE (V/O)
This is to let him know you're
looking for a proper place to pull
off and talk.

AN EXIT OFF RAMP: MAX SPEED 25.

DUKE hits the brakes.  The COP brakes.

DUKE (V/O)
It will take him a moment to
realize that he is about to make
180 degree turn at speed... but you
will be ready for it, braced for
the G's and the fast heel toe work.

The patrol car spins and fishtails crazily out of control.

EXT. SCENIC PICNIC AREA - DAY

The patrol car comes skidding around the corner.  DUKE
stands beside the RED SHARK, completely relaxed and smiling.

The HIGHWAY PATROLMAN gets out of the car, screaming.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Just what the FUCK did you think
you were doing?!

DUKE smiles.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
May I see your license.

DUKE
Of course, officer.

DUKE reaches for it.  And BOTH MEN look down at a beer
can -- which DUKE had, somehow, forgotten was in his hand.

DUKE (V/O)
I knew I was fucked.

The COP relaxes -- actually smiles... He reaches out for
DUKE's wallet, then holds out his other hand for the beer.

59.


HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Could I have that, please?

DUKE
Why not?  It was getting warm anyway.

The HIGHWAY PATROLMAN takes it, pours out the beer --
glances in the back seat of the RED SHARK.  Amongst the bars
of soap... A case of warm beer.  DUKE smiles back at him.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
You realize...

DUKE
Yeah.  I know.  I'm guilty.  I
understand that.  I knew it was a
crime but I did it anyway.  Shit,
why argue?  I'm a fucking criminal.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
That's a strange attitude.

He looks at DUKE thoughtfully.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
You know -- I get the feeling you
could use a nap.  There's a rest
area up ahead.  Why don't you pull
over and sleep a few hours?

DUKE
A nap won't help.  I've been awake
for too long -- three or four
nights.  I can't even remember.  If
I go to sleep now, I'm dead for
twenty hours.

The HIGHWAY PATROLMAN smiles.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Okay.  Here's how it is.  What goes
into my book, as of noon, is that I
apprehended you... for driving too
fast, and advised you to proceed no
further than the next rest area...
your stated destination, right?
Where you plan to take a long nap.
Do I make myself clear?

DUKE
How far is Baker?  I was hoping to
stop there for lunch.

60.


HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Not my jurisdiction.  The city
limits are two point two miles
beyond the rest area.  Can you make
it that far?

DUKE
I'll try.  I've been wanting to go
to Baker for a long time.  I've
heard a lot about it.

The PATROLMAN holds the door for DUKE who gets in.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Excellent seafood.  With a mind
like yours, you'll probably want to
try the land-crab.  Try the Majestic
Diner.

The PATROLMAN slams the door shut.

EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY

DUKE drives away -- teeth gritted.

DUKE (V/O)
I felt raped.  The Pig had done me
on all fronts, and now he was going
off to chuckle about it -- on the
west side of town, waiting for me
to make a run for L.A.

DUKE drives past the rest area to an intersection where he
signals to turn right into Baker.  As he approaches the turn
he sees the HITCHHIKER!  As DUKE slows to make the turn
their eyes meet.  DUKE is about to wave -- but the HITCHHIKER
drops his thumb.

DUKE
Great Jesus, it's him.

DUKE, spooked, SPINS THE RED SHARK round -- ROARS BACK THE
WAY HE CAME.

EXT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY

DUKE on the public phone booth -- screaming.

DUKE
They've nailed me!  I'm trapped in
some stinking desert crossroads
called Baker.  I don't have much
time.  The fuckers are closing in.
They'll hunt me down like a beast!

61.


INT. GONZO'S OFFICE - DAY

GONZO sits surrounded by legal papers and law books.  Mexican
Day of the Dead masks hang from the walls -- flame-red demons.

GONZO
Who?  You sound a little paranoid.

EXT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY

DUKE screams -- sweat pouring.

DUKE
You bastard!  I need a lawyer
immediately!

INT. GONZO'S OFFICE - DAY

GONZO
What are you doing in Baker?
Didn't you get my telegram?

EXT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY

DUKE
What?  Fuck telegrams.  I'm in
trouble.  You worthless bastard.
I'll cripple your ass for this!
All that shit in the car is yours!
You understand that?  When I finish
testifying out here you'll be
disbarred!

INT. GONZO'S OFFICE - DAY

GONZO
You're supposed to be in Vegas.  We
have a suite at the Flamingo.  I
was just about to leave for the
airport.

INT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY

DUKE pulls out the telegram from his top pocket.

GONZO'S VOICE
You brainless scumbag!  You're
supposed to be covering the National
District Attorney's conference!  I
made all the reservations... rented
a white Cadillac convertible... the
whole thing is arranged!  What the
hell are you doing out there in the
middle of the fucking desert?

62.


DUKE stares at the telegram.

DUKE
Never mind.  It's all a big joke.
I'm actually sitting beside the
pool at the Flamingo.  I'm talking
from a portable phone.  Some dwarf
brought it out from the casino.  I
have total credit!  Can you grasp
that?
(shouts)
Don't come anywhere near this place!
Foreigners aren't welcome here!

DUKE, breathing heavily, hangs up phone.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

C/U of .357 Magnum cylinder being spun.

DUKE (V/O)
Well.  This is how the world works.

C/U An IGUANA basks in the sun.

DUKE (V/O)
All energy flows according to the
whims of the Great Magnet.

C/U Barrel of the gun.  It fires.  An explosion of desert
dirt.

DUKE (V/O)
What a fool I was to defy Him.

The IGUANA sits unfazed.

DUKE (V/O)
Never cross the Great Magnet.  I
understood this now...
(another blast from
the gun)
... and with understanding came a
sense of almost terminal relief.

DUKE stands alone in the vast desert firing at nothing, the
thuds of the explosions echo away.

EXT. ROAD INTO VEGAS - DAY

The RED SHARK driving back towards Las Vegas.

63.


DUKE (V/O)
I had to get rid of The Shark.  Too
many people might recognize it...
...especially the Vegas Police.
(tight C/U of DUKE)
Luckily, my credit card was still
technically valid.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

DUKE, now driving a white Cadillac Coupe de Ville -- THE
WHITE WHALE.

DUKE pushes buttons -- lowers the top.

DUKE (V/O)
This was a superior machine -- ten
grand worth of gimmicks and high
price special effects.  The rear
windows leapt up with a touch like
frogs in a dynamited pond.  The
dashboard was full of esoteric
lights and dials and meters that I
would never understand.

EXT. FLAMINGO HOTEL - AFTERNOON

A GIANT SIGN: THE FLAMINGO WELCOMES THE NATIONAL DA'S
CONFERENCE ON NARCOTICS & DANGEROUS DRUGS.

DUKE (V/O)
If the Pigs were gathering in
Vegas, I felt the Drug Culture
should be represented as well...
and there was a certain bent appeal
in the notion of running a savage
burn on one Las Vegas hotel and
then just wheeling across town and
checking into another.

The WHITE WHALE turns into a VIP parking slot, immediately
attended by impressed MINIONS.

DUKE (V/O)
Me and a thousand ranking cops from
all over America.  Why not?  Move
confidently into their midst.

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL LOBBY - AFTERNOON

DUKE enters -- old Levis, grubby sneakers, 10 peso Acapulco
shirt coming apart at the seams, 3 day growth, eyes hidden
behind mirror shades.  He heads for the check-in line.

64.


DUKE (V/O)
My arrival was badly timed.

THE PLACE IS FULL OF COPS.  200 of them, on vacation, all
dressed in cut price Vegas casuals: plaid Bermuda shorts,
Arnie Palmer golf shirts, and rubberized beach sandals.

Ahead of DUKE -- A POLICE CHIEF argues with the DESK CLERK.
The POLICE CHIEF'S AGNEW STYLE WIFE stands to the side,
weeping.  The POLICE CHIEF'S FRIENDS stand uneasily around.

POLICE CHIEF
What do you mean I'm too late to
register?  I'm a police chief.
From Michigan.  Look, fella, I told
you.
(waves a POSTCARD)
I have a postcard here that says I
have reservations in this hotel.

CLERK
(prissily)
I'm sorry, sir.  You're on the
"late list." Your reservations were
transferred to the... ah...
Moonlight Motel, which is out on
Paradise Boulevard...

POLICE CHIEF
I've already paid for my goddamn
room!

CLERK
It's actually a very fine place of
lodging and only sixteen blocks
from here, with its own pool and...

POLICE CHIEF
You dirty little faggot!  Call the
manager!  I'm tired of listening to
this dogshit!

FRIENDS restrain the POLICE CHIEF.

CLERK
(solicitously)
I'm so sorry, sir.  May I call you
a cab?

The POLICE CHIEF's screamed insults fade away...

DUKE (V/O)
Of course, I could hear what the
Clerk was really saying...

65.


CLERK
(IN DUKE'S IMAGINATION)
Listen, you fuzzy little shithead --
I've been fucked around, in my
time, by a fairly good cross-
section of mean-tempered rule-crazy
cops and now it's MY turn. "Fuck
you, officer, I'm in charge here,
and I'm telling you we don't have
room for you."

DUKE steps to the desk, around the raging POLICE CHIEF.

DUKE
Say.  I hate to interrupt, but I
wonder if maybe I could just sort
of slide through and get out of
your way.  Name's Raoul Duke --
Raoul Duke.  My attorney made the
reservation.

DUKE snaps a credit card down onto the counter.  EVERYONE
goes silent.  The POLICE CHIEF GROUP stares at him like he
was some kid of water rat crawling up to the desk.  The
CLERK hits the bell for the BELLBOY.

CLERK
Certainly, Mr. Duke!

DUKE
My bags are out there in that white
Cadillac convertible.  Can you have
someone drive it around to the room?

ALL EYES turn to the gleaming WHITE WHALE.

DUKE
Oh, and could I get a quart of Wild
Turkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and
a night's worth of ice delivered to
my room, please?

CLERK
Don't worry about a thing, sir.
Just enjoy your stay.

DUKE
Well, thank you.

DUKE gives the POLICE CHIEF a polite smile -- crosses to the
elevator -- turns to face the GAWPING COPS -- pops a can of
beer and toasts them.  The doors close.

66.


INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUITE - DAY

DUKE rams the key home -- swings the door open.

DUKE
Ah, home at last!

INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - AFTERNOON

DUKE enters.  The door hits something with a thud.

A 16-year-old GIRL with the aura of an angry Pit Bull.

GONZO stands in the bathroom doorway -- stark naked with a
drug-addled grin on his face.

DUKE
You degenerate pig!

GONZO
It can't be helped.  This is Lucy.
(laughing distractedly)
You know--like "Lucy In The Sky
With Diamonds."

LUCY eyes DUKE venomously.

GONZO
Lucy!  Lucy, be cool, goddamnit!
Remember what happened at the
airport!  No more of that, okay?

LUCY keeps her eyes on DUKE.  GONZO idles over and puts his
arm round her shoulder.

GONZO
Lucy... this is my client.  This is
Mr. Duke, the famous journalist.
He's paying for this suite, Lucy.
He's on our side.

DUKE flops onto the sofa.

GONZO
Mr. Duke is my friend.  He loves
artists.

DUKE notices for the first time that the room is full of
artwork.  Maybe 40 or 50 portraits, some in oil, some in
charcoal, all more or less the same size and same face.

GONZO
Lucy paints portraits of Barbra
Streisand.

67.


LUCY
I drew these from TV.

GONZO
Fantastic.  She came all the way
down here from Montana just to give
these portraits to Barbra.  We're
going over to the Americana Hotel
tonight to meet her backstage...

DUKE's voice rises above GONZO.

DUKE (V/O)
I desperately needed peace, rest,
sanctuary.  I hadn't counted on
this.  Finding my attorney on acid
and locked into some kind of
preternatural courtship.

DUKE
Well, I guess they brought the car
round by now.  LET'S GET THE STUFF
OUT OF THE TRUNK.

DUKE fixes GONZO hard.

GONZO
Absolutely, LET'S GET THE STUFF.
(to LUCY)
Now, we'll be right back.  Don't
answer the phone if it rings.

LUCY
(makes one-fingered
Jesus freak sign)
God bless.

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUITE - DAY

DUKE collars GONZO -- serious.

DUKE
WELL?  What are your plans?

GONZO
Plans?

DUKE
Lucy.

68.


GONZO
(struggling to focus)
Shit.  I met her on the plane and I
had all that acid.
(he shrugs)
You know, those little blue barrels.
I gave her a cap before I realized...
she's a religious freak... Jesus,
she's never even had a drink.

DUKE
Well... It'll probably work out.
We can keep her loaded and peddle
her ass at the drug convention.

GONZO stares uneasily at DUKE.

GONZO
Listen, she's running away from
home for something like the fifth
time in six months.  It's terrible.

DUKE
She's perfect for this gig.  These
cops will go fifty bucks a head to
beat her into submission and then
gang fuck her.  We can set her up
in one of these back street motels,
hang pictures of Jesus all over the
room, then turn these pigs loose on
her... Hell she's strong; she'll
hold her own.

GONZO's face twitches badly.

GONZO
Jesus Christ.  I knew you were sick
but I never expected to hear you
actually say that kind of stuff.

DUKE
It's straight economics.  This girl
is a god-send.  Shit, she can make
us a grand a day.

GONZO
NO!  Stop talking like that.

DUKE
I figure she can do about four at a
time.  Christ, if we keep her full
of acid that's more like two grand
a day.  Maybe three.

69.


GONZO
You filthy bastard.  I should cave
your fucking head in.

DUKE
In a few hours, she'll probably be
sane enough to work herself into a
towering Jesus-based rage at the
hazy recollection of being seduced
by some kind of cruel Samoan who
fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her
to a Vegas hotel room and savagely
penetrated every orifice in her
body with his throbbing,
uncircumcised member.

GONZO starts crying.

GONZO
NO!  I felt sorry for the girl, I
wanted to help her!

DUKE
You'll go straight to the gas
chamber.  And even if you manage to
beat that, they'll send you back to
Nevada for Rape and Consensual
Sodomy.  She's got to go.

Pause.

GONZO
Shit, it doesn't pay to try to help
somebody these days.

A silence.

DUKE (V/O)
The only alternative was to take
her out to the desert and feed her
remains to the lizards.  But, it
seemed a bit heavy for the thing we
were trying to protect: My attorney.

GONZO
We have to cut her loose.  She's
got two hundred dollars.  And we
can always call the cops up there
in Montana, where she lives, and
turn her in.

DUKE
What?... What kind of goddamn
monster are you?

70.


GONZO
It just occurred to me, that she
has no witnesses.  Anything that
she says about us is completely
worthless.

DUKE
Us?

INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - SUNSET

DUKE is speaking into the phone in hushed tones.

DUKE
Hotel Americana?  I need a
reservation.  For my niece.  Listen,
I need her treated very gently.
She's an artist, and might seem a
trifle highstrung...

In the background GONZO helps LUCY and her paintings out the
door.

GONZO
Okay, Lucy, it's time to go meet
Barbra...

DUKE (V/O)
I felt like a Nazi, but it had to
be done.

EXT. ON THE STREETS - A CAB STAND - DUSK

The WHITE WHALE pulls up -- DUKE at the wheel.  GONZO helps
LUCY and her paintings from the car.

DUKE (V/O)
Lucy was a potentially fatal
millstone on both our necks.  There
was absolutely no choice but to cut
her adrift and hope her memory was
fucked.

GONZO unrolls a couple of bills -- pays off a CAB DRIVER --
waves to LUCY in the back with her paintings.  She's starting
to come down...

GONZO gets back in the WHITE WHALE and slaps his hands
together as if washing his hands of the situation.

GONZO
Well that's that.  Take off slowly.
Don't attract attention.

71.


They pull out into traffic.

EXT. LAS VEGAS STREETS - DUSK

GONZO
I gave the cabbie an extra ten
bucks to make sure she gets there
safe.  Also, I told him I'd be
there myself in an hour, and if she
wasn't, I'd come back out here and
rip his lungs out.

DUKE
That's good.  You can't be subtle
in this town.

GONZO
As your attorney, I advise you to
tell me where you put the goddamn
mescaline.

DUKE
Maybe we should take it easy tonight.

GONZO
Right.  Let's find a good seafood
restaurant and eat some red salmon.
I feel a powerful lust for red
salmon...

The electric WHITE WHALE heads off down the Strip.  The
sun's going down behind the scrub hills, a good Kristofferson
tune croaks on the radio in the warm dusk.

INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - BATHROOM - NEXT MORNING

GONZO throws up in the toilet bowl.

In the background, DUKE opens curtains.  Daylight blinds him.

DUKE
Come on, we're going to be late.

GONZO looks up at his sick reflection -- wipes his mouth
with a towel.

GONZO
This goddamn mescaline.  Why the
fuck can't they make it a little
less pure?  Maybe mix it up with
Rolaids or something.

72.


INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - DAY

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
(crackling and
booming over the
lousy sound system)
On behalf of the prosecuting
attorneys of this county, I welcome
you to the Third National DA's
Conference on Narcotics and
Dangerous Drugs.

The EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR -- well groomed, GOP businessman
type -- speaks from the podium.  A banner behind him reads:
NATIONAL DA'S CONVENTION 1971. "If You Don't Know, Come To
Learn... If You Know, Come To Teach."

A BIG MIXED CROWD: TOP LEVEL STRAIGHT COPS, UNDERCOVER NARCS
AND OTHER TWILIGHT TYPES -- beards, mustaches and super-Mod
dress.  Just because you're a cop, doesn't mean you can't be
WITH IT!  However, for every URBAN-HIPSTER there are around
20 REDNECKS.

A dozen big, low-fidelity speakers mounted on steel poles
distort and feed back the EXECUTIVE's voice through the room.

At the back, under a loudspeaker, sits DUKE -- $40 FBI
wingtips, a Pat Boone madras sportcoat, and an official name
tag: RAOUL DUKE, PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR, L.A.

GONZO sits beside him.  His name tag: DR. GONZO.  EXPERT,
CRIMINAL DRUG ANALYSIS.  He's nervous -- close to the edge.

GONZO
(lowers his voice)
I saw these bastards in Easy Rider,
but I didn't believe they were real.
Not like this.  Not hundreds of them!

DUKE
They're actually nice people when
you get to know them.

GONZO
Man, I know these people in my
goddamn blood!

DUKE
Don't mention that word around here.
You'll get them excited.

GONZO
This is a fucking nightmare.

73.


DUKE
Right.  Sure as hell some dope-
dealing bomb freak is going to
recognize you and put the word out
that you're partying with a thousand
cops.

COP IN BACK
SSSSHHH!

DR. BLUMQUIST -- a "drug expert" -- takes the stage.

DR. BLUMQUIST
We must come to terms with the Drug
Culture in the country... country...
country...

The sound systems echoes.

DR. BLUMQUIST (CONT'D)
The reefer butt is called a "roach,"
because it resembles a cockroach...
cockroach... cockroach...

GONZO
(whispers)
What the fuck are these people
talking about?  You'd have to be
crazy on acid to think a joint
looked like a goddamn cockroach!

DUKE (V/O)
It was clear that we had stumbled
into a prehistoric gathering.

DR. BLUMQUIST
Now, there are four states of being
in the cannabis, or marijuana,
society: Cool, Groovy, Hip, and
Square.  The square is seldom if
ever cool.  He is not "with it,"
that is, he doesn't know "what's
happening." But if he manages to
figure it out, he moves up a notch
to "hip."

DUKE and GONZO listen in disbelief.

DR. BLUMQUIST (CONT'D)
And if he can bring himself to
approve of what is happening, he
becomes "groovy." After that, with
much luck and perseverance, he can
rise to the rank of "cool." A cool
guy... cool guy... cool guy...

74.


COP IN BACK
Dr. Bloomquist, do you think the
anthropologist, Margaret Mead's
strange behavior of late might
possibly be explained by a private
marijuana addiction?

DR. BLUMQUIST
I really don't know, but at her
age, if she did smoke grass, she'd
have one hell of a trip!

Roars of laughter.

GONZO
I know a hell of a lot better ways
to waste my time than listening to
this bullshit.

He stands, knocking the ashtray off his chair arm, and
plunges down the aisle to the door.

COP IN BACK
Down in front!

GONZO
Fuck you!  I have to get out!  I
don't belong here!

COP IN BACK
Good riddance!

He stumbles from the room.  DUKE turns his attention back to
the stage.

The lights go down.  A black & white film -- REEFER
MADNESS! -- illustrates his now evangelical talk.

FILM NARRATOR
KNOW YOUR DOPE FIEND!  YOUR LIFE
MAY DEPEND ON IT!  You will not be
able to see his eyes because of
Tea-Shades, but his knuckles will
be white from inner tension...

DUKE turns his attention to a 340 pound TEXAN POLICE CHIEF
who necks with his 290 pound WIFE beside him.

FILM NARRATOR
... and his pants will be crusted
with semen from constantly jacking
off when he can't find a rape
victim...

75.


DUKE gazes at the TEXAN and his WIFE. -- Feigning sickness,
he gets up, hand over mouth.

DUKE
Pardon me, I feel sick.

FILM NARRATOR
He will stagger and babble when
questioned.  He will not respect
your badge.  The Dope Fiend fears
nothing.  He will attack, for no
reason, with every weapon at his
command -- including yours...

DUKE heads for the exit.

DUKE
Sorry, sick... Beg pardon!  Feeling
sick...

FILM NARRATOR
BEWARE.  Any officer apprehending a
suspected marijuana addict should
use all necessary force immediately.
One stitch in time [on him] will
usually save nine on you.

DUKE CRASHES OUT THROUGH THE DOOR.

INT. CASINO BAR - DAY

DUKE sees GONZO at the bar -- talking to a SPORTY LOOKING
COP about 40 whose name tag identifies him as a DISTRICT
ATTORNEY FROM GEORGIA.

DA
I'm a whiskey man myself.  We don't
have much trouble from drugs where
I come from...

GONZO
You will.  One of these nights
you'll wake up and find a junkie
tearing your bedroom apart.

DA
Naw!

GONZO
They'll climb right into your
bedroom and sit on your chest with
big Bowie knives.  They might even
sit on your wife's chest.  Put the
blade right down on her throat.

76.


DA
Not down in my parts.

DUKE joins them.

DUKE
(to WAITRESS)
Rum and ice, please.

DA
(looks at DUKE'S NAME TAG)
You're another one of these
California boys.  Your friend
here's been tellin' us about dope
fiends.

DUKE
They're everywhere.  Nobody's safe.
And sure as hell not in the South.
They like warm weather... You'd
never believe it.  In L.A. it's out
of control.  First it was drugs,
now it's witchcraft.

DA
Witchcraft?  Shit, you can't mean it!

The BARTENDER cleans his glasses, one ear straining for the
conversation.

GONZO
Read the newspapers.

DUKE
Man, you don't know trouble until
you have to face down a bunch of
these addicts gone crazy for human
sacrifice!

DA
Naw!  That's science fiction stuff!

DUKE
Not where we operate.

GONZO
Hell, in Malibu alone, these
goddamn Satan worshippers kill six
or eight people every day.  All
they want is the blood.  They'll
take people right off the street if
they have to.

77.


DUKE
Just the other day we had a case
where they grabbed a girl right out
of a McDonald's hamburger stand.
She was a waitress, about sixteen
years old... with a lot of people
watching, too!

The BARTENDER keeps cleaning the same glass -- more and more
furiously.

DA
What happened?  What did they do to
her?

GONZO
Do?  Jesus Christ, man.  They
chopped her goddamn head off right
there in the parking lot!  Then
they cut all kinds of holes in her
head and sucked out the blood!

DA
(DA ad-libs a
summation of the crime)
And nobody did anything?

DUKE
What could they do?  The guy that
took the head was about six-seven,
and maybe three-hundred pounds.  He
was packing two Lugers, and the
others had M-16s.

GONZO
They just ran back out into Death
Valley -- you know, where Manson
turned up...

DUKE
Like big lizards.

GONZO
... and every one of them stacked
naked...

DA
Naked!?

DUKE
Naked.

78.


GONZO
Yeh, naked!... except for the
weapons.

DUKE
They were all veterans.

DA
Veterans?!!!?

Agog with the horrors of the story, the BARTENDER polishes
the glass -- faster and faster...

GONZO
Yeh.  The big guy used to be a
major in the Marines.

DA
A major!

GONZO
We know where he lives, but we
can't get near the house.

DA
Naw!  Not a major.

GONZO
He wanted the pineal gland.

DA
Really?

GONZO
That's how he got so big.  When he
quit the Marines he was just a
little guy.

DUKE
Usually, it's whole families.
During the night.  Most of them
don't even wake up until they feel
their heads going -- and then, of
course, it's too late.

The glass smashes in the BARTENDER's hand.

DUKE (CONT'D)
Happens every day.

DUKE turns to a WAITRESS with a warm smile.

79.


DUKE (CONT'D)
Three more rums.  Plenty of ice.
Maybe a handful of lime chunks.

WAITRESS
Are you guys with the police
convention upstairs?

DA
We sure are, Miss.

WAITRESS
I thought so.  I never heard that
kind of talk around here before.
Jesus Christ!  How do you guys
stand that kind of work?

GONZO
(grinning)
We like it.  It's groovy.

The WAITRESS stares -- sickened -- at GONZO.

DUKE
What's wrong with you?  Hell,
somebody has to do it.

GONZO
Hurry up with those drinks.  We're
thirsty.  Only two rums.  Make mine
a Bloody Mary.

DA
(whacks his fist on
the bar)
Hell, I really hate to hear this.
Because everything that happens in
California seems to get down our
way, sooner or later.  Mostly
Atlanta.  But that was back when
the goddamn bastards were peaceful.
All we had to do was to keep 'em
under surveillance.  They didn't
roam around much... But now Jesus,
it seems nobody's safe.

GONZO
(with a conspiratorial
nod)
You're going to need to take the
bull by the horns -- go to the mat
with this scum.

80.


DA
What do you mean by that?

GONZO
You know what I mean.  We've done
it before and we can damn well do
it again!

DUKE
Cut their goddamn heads off.  Every
one of them.  That's what we're
doing in California.

DA
(stupefied)
WHAT?

GONZO
Sure.  It's all on the Q.T., but
everybody who matters is with us
all the way down the line.

DUKE
We keep it quiet.  It's not the
kind of thing you'd want to talk
about upstairs.  Not with the press
around.

DA
(recovering slightly)
Hell, no.  We'd never hear the
goddamn end of it.

DUKE
Dobermans don't talk.

DA
What?

GONZO
Sometimes it's easier to just rip
out the backstraps.

DUKE
They'll fight like hell if you try
to take the head without the dogs.

DA
God almighty!
(muttering in a daze)
I don't think I should tell my wife
about this.  She'd never understand.
You know how women are.

81.


DUKE gives the DA a brotherly slap on the back.

DUKE
Just be thankful your heart is
young and strong.

DUKE and GONZO leave the stunned DA -- staring into the
swirling ice in drink.

INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - DAY

DUKE and GONZO fall into the suite in fits of laughter.

GONZO feels the nausea rise suddenly -- heads for the
bathroom.  Immediate sounds of retching.

The phone message light is blinking.  DUKE opens a beer,
picks up the phone.

DUKE
What's the message?  My light is
blinking.

CLERK (V/O)
Ah, yes.  Mr. Duke?  You have one
message: "Call Lucy at the Americana
Hotel, room 1600."

DUKE
Holy shit!

DUKE slams the phone down.  GONZO emerges from the
bathroom -- looking like death.

DUKE
Lucy called.

GONZO sags visibly -- like an animal taking a bullet.

GONZO
What?

The telephone rings.  DUKE answers.

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL - RECEPTION - DAY

A worried CLERK speaks in to the phone.

CLERK
Mr. Duke?  Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm
sorry we were cut off a moment
ago... I thought I should call
again, because I was wondering...

82.


INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - DAY

DUKE
WHAT?
(hand over the PHONE)
What was that crazy bitch said to
him?
(screams)
There's a war on, man!  People are
being killed!

CLERK (V/O)
Killed?

DUKE
IN VIETNAM!  ON THE GODDAMN
TELEVISION!

CLERK (V/O)
Oh... yes... yes... This terrible
war.  When will it end?

DUKE
Tell me.  What do you want?

In the background GONZO is upturning a sofa to retrieve his
stash from the lining.

CLERK (V/O)
The woman who left that message for
you sounded very disturbed.  I
think she was crying...

DUKE
Crying?  Why was she crying?

CLERK (V/O)
Well, uh.  She didn't say Mr. Duke.
But since I know you're here with
the Police Convention...

DUKE
Look, you want to be gentle with
that woman if she ever calls again.
We're watching her very carefully...
this woman has been into laudanum.
It's a controlled experiment, but I
suspect we'll need your cooperation
before this thing is over.

CLERK (V/O)
(hesitantly)
Well, certainly... We're always
happy to cooperate with the police...

83.


DUKE
Don't worry.  You're protected.
Just treat this poor woman like
you'd treat any other human being
in trouble.

CLERK (V/O)
What?  Ah... yes, yes, I see what
you mean... Yes... so, you'll be
responsible then?

DUKE
Of course.  And now I have to get
back to the news.  Send up some ice.

He hangs up.  GONZO zaps TV channels -- commercials.

GONZO
Good work.  They'll treat us like
goddamn lepers after that.

DUKE
(slowly, carefully)
Lucy is looking for you.

GONZO
(laughing)
No, she's looking for you.

DUKE
Me?

GONZO
She really flipped over you.  The
only way I could get rid of her was
by saying you were taking me out to
the desert for a showdown -- that
you wanted me out of the way so you
could have her all to yourself.
(laughing again)
I guess she figures you won.  That
phone message wasn't for me, was it?

A look of stunned realization from DUKE...

INT. FANTASY COURT ROOM - DAY

LUCY is on the witness stand.

LUCY
Yessir, those two men in the dock
are the ones who gave me the LSD
and took me to the hotel.

84.


A doomed DUKE and GONZO await their fate.

LUCY
I don't know for sure what they
done to me, but I remember it was
horrible.

JUDGE
Twenty years... and Double
Castration!

The JUDGE bangs his gavel.

INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - DAY

DUKE is madly stuffing his suitcase.

GONZO
Wait!  You can't leave me alone in
this snake pit.  This room is in my
name.

DUKE KEEPS PACKING.  GONZO is looking worried.

GONZO
OK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call
her.  I'll get her off our backs.
You're right.  She's my problem.

DUKE
It's gone too far.

GONZO
Relax.  Let me handle this.
(dials the PHONE,
snaps angrily at DUKE)
You'd make a piss-poor lawyer.
...Room 1600, please.
(to DUKE)
As your attorney, I advise you not
to worry.
(nods towards bathroom)
Take a hit out of that little brown
bottle in my shaving kit.

DUKE goes in the bathroom.  He finds a little bottle -- a
label: "DRINK ME."

DUKE
What is this?

85.


GONZO
You won't need much.  Just a little
tiny taste, that stuff makes pure
mescaline seem like ginger-beer.
Adrenochrome.

DUKE stares wonderingly at the bottle.

DUKE
Adrenochrome...

GONZO
(into PHONE)
Hi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me.  I got
your message...what?  Hell, no, I
taught the bastard a lesson he'll
never forget... what?  No, not
dead, but he won't be bothering
anybody for a while.  Yeah.  I left
him out there, I stomped him, then
pulled all his teeth out...

DUKE (V/O)
I remember thinking, "Jesus, what a
terrible thing to lay on somebody
with a head full of acid."

DUKE dips a match head into the brown bottle -- studies
it -- TASTES IT -- NOTHING -- TASTES SOME MORE...

GONZO
(to PHONE)
But here's the problem.  That
bastard cashed a bad check
downstairs and gave you as a
reference.  They'll be looking for
both of you.  Yeah, I know, but you
can't judge a book by its cover,
Lucy.  Some people are just
basically rotten... Anyway, the
last thing you want to do is call
this hotel again; they'll trace the
call and put you straight behind
bars... no, I'm moving to the
Tropicana right away.  I have to
go, they've got the phone tapped.
Yeah, I know, it was horrible, but
it's all over now... OH MY GOD!
THEY'RE KICKING THE DOOR DOWN!
(throws the PHONE
down; shouts)
No!  Get away from me!  I'm innocent!
It was Duke!  I swear to God!
(MORE)

86.


GONZO (CONT'D)
(stomps the PHONE; moans)
No, I don't know where she is.
You'll never catch Lucy!  She's
gone!  I swear, I don't know where
she is!  DON'T PUT THAT THING ON ME!
(slams the PHONE down)


GONZO sits back in his chair... watching MISSION IMPOSSIBLE.

GONZO
Well.  That's that.  She's probably
stuffing herself down the
incinerator about now.  That's the
last we should be hearing from Lucy.
(fumbling with the
hash pipe)
Where's the opium?

DUKE stares at the back of GONZO's neck.  SOMETHING VERY
STRANGE IS HAPPENING TO HIM...

DUKE (V/O)
I remember slumping on the bed, his
performance had given me a bad jolt.
For a moment I thought his mind had
snapped -- that he actually believed
he was being attacked by invisible
enemies.  But the room was quiet
again.

DUKE CLUTCHES THE BROWN BOTTLE.

DUKE
Where'd you get this?

GONZO
Never mind, it's absolutely pure.

DUKE
Jesus... what kind of monster
client have you picked up this time?
There's only one source for this
stuff -- the adrenaline gland from
a living human body!

GONZO turns to smile at DUKE.

87.


GONZO
I know, but the guy didn't have any
cash to pay me.  He's one of these
Satanism freaks.  He offered me
human blood -- said it would take
me higher than I've ever been in my
life.
(laughs -- struts
round DUKE -- eyes
bright with expectation)
I thought he was kidding, so I told
him I'd just as soon have an ounce
or so of pure adrenochrome -- or
maybe just a fresh adrenaline gland
to chew on.

DUKE (V/O)
I could already feel the stuff
working on me -- the first wave
felt like a combination of mescaline
and methedrine -- maybe I should
take a swim, I thought...

DUKE sees that GONZO is TOYING WITH HIS HUNTING KNIFE...

GONZO
Yeah, they nailed this guy for
child molesting.  He swore he
didn't do it. "Why should I fuck
with children?" he says. "They're
too small." Christ, werewolf is
entitled to legal counsel.  I
didn't dare turn the creep down.
He might have picked up a letter
opener and gone after my pineal
gland!

GONZO JABS WITH THE RAZOR BRIGHT KNIFE.  DUKE'S BODY IS
GOING RIGID -- HE SPEAKS THROUGH GRITTED TEETH.

DUKE
Why not?  We should get some of
that.  Just eat a big handful and
see what happens.

GONZO
Some of what?

DUKE
(spitting words)
Extract of pineal!

88.


GONZO
(STARING AT DUKE WITH
A STRANGE SMILE)
Sure.  That's a good idea.  One
whiff of that shit would turn you
into something out of a goddamn
medical encyclopedia.

GONZO GROWS HORNS -- HIS FACE BECOMES A MEXICAN DEMON MASK.

GONZO
Man, your head would swell up like
a watermelon, you'd probably gain
about a hundred pounds in two
hours...

A CLOVEN HOOF BURSTS THROUGH GONZO'S SHOE.

DUKE
Right!

GONZO
... grow claws... bleeding warts.

GONZO'S CHEST EXPANDS -- BONY RIBS BURSTING HIS SHIRT.

DUKE
Yes!

GONZO
... then you'd notice about six
huge hairy tits swelling up on your
back...

A TAIL LASHES, HOOFS STRIKE THE FLOOR.  GONZO TOWERS -- A
FLAME RED DEMON!

DUKE
Fantastic!

DUKE is now so wire that his hands are CLAWING UNCONTROLLABLY
at the bedspread, JERKING IT RIGHT OUT FROM UNDER HIM.  His
heels are dug into the mattress with both KNEES LOCKED,
EYEBALLS SWELLING.

GONZO-DEMON LOOMS AGAINST THE CEILING.

GONZO
you'd go blind... your body would
turn to wax... they'd have to put
you in a wheelbarrow and...

GONZO'S VOICE FADES AWAY -- DUKE'S frenzied gaze reveals
GONZO REVERTED TO NORMAL HUMAN SHAPE AND SIZE.

89.


GONZO
Man I'll try about anything; but
I'd never touch a pineal gland.

DUKE
FINISH THE FUCKING STORY!  What
happened?!  What about the glands?

GONZO, a small smile on his lips, backs away warily...
towards the TV -- NOW A HUNDRED FEET AWAY IN THE DISTANCE...

GONZO
Jesus, that stuff got right on top
of you, didn't it.

VEINS stand out on DUKE's forehead.  He is purplish-red.
OVER THE TOP!  Too late, he realizes he is NEAR DEATH!

DUKE
Maybe you could just... shove me
into the pool, or something...

GONZO shakes his head disgustedly.

GONZO
If I put you in the pool right now,
you'd sink like a goddamn stone.
You took too much.  Jesus, look at
your face, you're about to explode.

GONZO sits back down... watching the TV.

GONZO
Don't try and fight it, or you'll
get brain bubbles.  Strokes,
aneurysms.  You'll just wither up
and die.

DUKE FALLS TO THE GROUND, WRITHING, CATATONIC, SINKING INTO
PARALYSIS.

AND THE SOUND, SUDDENLY AND STRANGELY, OF THE VOICE OF
RICHARD NIXON AND HIS DISTORTED FACE ON THE TV SCREEN.

NIXON
Sacrifice... sacrifice...
sacrifice...

DUKE PASSES OUT.

BLACK SCREEN

90.


INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

Darkness.  Insanely, somewhere NILSSON plays -- "Put the
lime in the coconut and mix em all up..."

DUKE (V/O)
What kind of rat-bastard psychotic
would play that song -- right now,
at this moment?

DUKE opens his eyes and the hotel suite rushes in.  He lies,
awkwardly twisted -- unable to move.  He could have been
there days -- months.

DUKE (V/O)
When I came to the general back
alley ambiance of the suite was so
rotten, so incredibly foul.  How
long had I been lying there?  Hours?
Days?  Months?  All these signs of
violence.  What had happened?

DUKE moves his eyes -- taking in his surroundings: Like THE
SIGHT OF SOME DISASTROUS ZOOLOGICAL EXPERIMENT involving
whisky and gorillas.  Blue and red Christmas tree lights
replace lightbulbs, used towels hanging everywhere,
pornographic pictures ripped out of a magazine are plastered
on a shattered mirror.

DUKE (V/O)
There was evidence in this room of
excessive consumption of almost
every type of drug known to
civilized man since 1544 AD.

DUKE manages to move -- stiffly gets to his bare feet --
HOBBLES ROUND THE TRASHED ROOM like a newly risen ape.

DUKE (V/O)
But what kind of addict would need
all these coconut husks and crushed
honeydew rinds?  Would the presence
of junkies account for all these
uneaten french fries?  These
puddles of glazed ketchup on the
bureau?  Maybe so, but then why all
this booze?  And these crude
pornographic photos smeared with
mustard that had dried to a hard
yellow crust...

DUKE peers into Gonzo's room -- HIS BED LIKE A BURNED OUT
RAT'S NEST -- blackened springs and wires.

91.


DUKE (V/O)
These were not the hoof prints of
your normal god-fearing junkie.  It
was too savage, too aggressive.

QUICK FLASHBACK:

GONZO SMASHES THE TEN FOOT MIRROR WITH A HAMMER:

BACK IN THE ROOM:

DUKE stares at the smashed mirror.

DUKE (V/O)
Grim memories and bad flashbacks.

In the bathroom, DUKE'S unlaced boots CRUSH BROKEN GLASS IN
VOMIT AND GRAPEFRUIT RINDS.

DUKE unzips and pisses.  THERE IN THE TOILET BOWL IS THE
MAGNUM .357!

DUKE (V/O)
Something ugly had happened.  I was
sure of it...

DUKE stares at the golden stream SPLASHING ON THE GUN.

The SOUNDS OF VOMITING come from a closet near the front door.

DUKE looks into the room.  He sees GONZO's ass sticking out
of the closet.  He opens his mouth to speak when, IN THE
SMASHED MIRROR HE SEES THE FRAGMENTED REFLECTION OF HIMSELF...
sleeping on the sofa.

The ominous SOUND OF A KEY TURNING in the room lock.

A hellish scream wakes up the SLEEPING DUKE.  He sees GONZO
grappling naked with the maid -- gun to her head.  GONZO is
muffling her screams with an ice bag.

MAID
Please... please... I'm only the
maid.  I didn't mean nothin!...

DUKE
(jumps up from the
bed, flashing his
press badge)
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!

92.


GONZO
(to DUKE)
She must have used a pass key.  I
was polishing my shoes in the
closet when I noticed her sneaking
in-so I took her.

DUKE shakes his head.

DUKE
(barks at the MAID)
What made you do it?  Who paid you
off?

MAID
Nobody.  I'm the maid!

GONZO
You're lying!  You were after the
evidence.  Who put you up to
this -- the manager?

MAID
I don't know what you're talking
about!

GONZO
Bullshit!  You're just as much a
part of it as they are!

MAID
Part of what?

DUKE
The dope ring.  You must know
what's going on in this hotel.  Why
do you think we're here?

MAID
(blubbering)
I know you're cops, but I thought
you were just here for that
convention.  I swear!  All I wanted
to do was clean up the room.  I
don't know anything about dope!

GONZO laughs.

GONZO
Come on, baby don't try to tell us
you never heard of the Grange Gorman.

93.


MAID
No!  No!  I swear to Jesus I never
heard of that stuff!

DUKE
Maybe she's telling the truth.
Maybe she's not part of it.

MAID
No!  I swear I'm not!

GONZO
(long pause)
In that case, maybe she can help.

MAID
Yes!  I'll help you all you need!
I hate dope!

DUKE
So do we, lady.

GONZO
(helping her up)
I think we should put her on the
payroll.  See what she comes up with.

DUKE
Do you think you can handle it?

MAID
What?

GONZO
One phone call every day.  Just
tell us what you've seen.  Don't
worry if it doesn't add up, that's
our problem.

GONZO hustles the MAID to the door.

MAID
You'd pay me for that?

DUKE
You're damn right.  But the first
time you say anything about this,
to anybody -- you'll go straight to
prison for the rest of your life.
What's your name?

MAID
Alice.  Just ring Linen Service and
ask for Alice.

94.


GONZO
Alright, Alice... you'll be
contacted by Inspector Rock.
Arthur Rock.  He'll be posing as a
politician.

DUKE
Inspector Rock will pay you.  In
cash.  A thousand dollars on the
ninth of every month.

MAID
Oh Lord!  I'd do just about anything
for that!

GONZO
You and a lot of other people.

DUKE
The password is: "One Hand Washes
The Other." The minute you hear
that, you say "I fear nothing."

MAID
I fear nothing.

She repeats the password several times while they listen to
make sure she has it right.

GONZO
Oh, and don't bother to make up the
room.  That way we won't have to
risk another of these little
incidents, will we?

MAID
Whatever you say, gentlemen.  I
can't tell you how sorry I am about
what happened...

GONZO
Don't worry, it's all over now.
Thank God for the decent people.

She smiles, repeating to herself "One Hand Washes The Other"
as GONZO hangs the DO NOT DISTURB sign and shuts the door.

CUT BACK TO THE PRESENT.

A grimy tape runs through a grunged-up portable tape recorder.

GONZO ON TAPE
... Thank God for the decent people.

95.


DUKE sits in the middle of the wrecked suite with his
mangled tape recorder in front of him.

DUKE (V/O)
Memories of that night are extremely
hazy...

DUKE fast forwards through the tape -- SEARCHING: "Awwww,
mama... can this really...be the end...?"

EXT. SAFEWAY SUPERMARKET - DAY

The WHITE WHALE waits -- gleaming -- beautiful.

DUKE (V/O)
There is a definite obligation,
when you boom around Vegas in a
white Coupe de Ville, to maintain a
certain style.

DUKE and GONZO burst out of the supermarket riding a shopping
basket loaded with COCONUTS, GRAPEFRUIT and TEQUILA.  They
send DEFEATED SHOPPERS sprawling.

The trolley collides into the WHITE WHALE.  SHOPPERS gather
at the supermarket entrance to watch -- baskets loaded with
junk, SCREAMING KIDS and EMPTY WALLETS.

DUKE switches on the music: JUMPING JACK FLASH.  He selects
a coconut -- ceremonially balances it on the hood.  GONZO
pulls out a silver claw-hammer.  A sly look at the gathering
CROWD... then he smashes the hammer down on the coconut!

A GASP from the surly SHOPPERS.

DUKE places another coconut.  SMASH!  Milk and white meat
flies everywhere.

SHOPPER #1
Hey!  Is that your car?

DUKE
Sure is.

SMASH!  Coconut fragments fly.

DUKE
Any of you folks want the milk?
We're after the meat.  This is
honest coconut essence.  Real meat.

SMASH!

96.


SHOPPER #2
Meat, hell!  Look what you're doing
to that car!

GONZO
Fuck the car.  They should make
these things with a goddamn FM radio.

SMASH!

DUKE
Yeh... This foreign made crap -- is
sucking our dollar balance dry!

SHOPPER #3
Someone should stop them!

SMASH!

DUKE
You poor fools don't understand, do
you?  This car is the property of
the World Bank!  That money goes to
ITALY!

SHOPPER #3
Somebody should call the police!

GONZO
Police?  Are you people crazy?

GONZO confronts the CROWD, hammer in one hand, a coconut in
the other.

GONZO (CONT'D)
You folks every heard of ole
Patrick Henry?  Know what he said?!

Silence -- the CROWD uncomprehending of this STONE DEGENERATE.

GONZO (CONT'D)
(ROARS)
GIVE ME LIBERTY OR GIVE ME DEATH!

GONZO brings the hammer down on the hood.  CLANG!

A gasp from the CROWD.  Getting ugly.

GONZO (CONT'D)
In Samoa we LOVE THE CONSTITUTION!

SHOPPER #3
Bullshit.

97.


The CROWD move in.

SHOPPER #1
Call the goddamn police!

GONZO SWINGS THE HAMMER.  CLANG!

SHOPPER #4
Look what they've done to that
beautiful car!

DUKE jumps in behind the wheel.

DUKE
This crowd is not rational.  They
can't relate to us.  Let's go!

A final CLANG!  GONZO jumps in.

DUKE floors the accelerator -- screams at the CROWD.

DUKE
You people voted for Hubert Humphrey!
You killed Jesus!

They swerve round and through the CROWD.

DUKE (V/O)
The crowd broke ranks.  Nobody
wants to be run over by a Coupe de
Ville.

INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE FAST-FORWARDS... PLAYS THE TAPE...

VOICE ON TAPE
You found the American Dream?  In
this town?

DUKE ON TAPE
We're sitting on the main nerve
right now...

INT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS REVOLVING MERRY-GO-ROUND BAR - NIGHT

DUKE and GONZO (wearing a single black glove) talk
conspiratorially to a 3RD MAN.  A PLACID ORANGUTAN in a bow
tie sits next to him.  THE BAR IS REVOLVING FASTER THAN
NORMAL.  DUKE IS INSANELY TALKATIVE -- WIRED!

98.


DUKE
The manager told me a story about
the owner of this place...about how
he always wanted to run away and
join the circus when he was a kid.
Well, now the bastard has his own
circus, and a license to steal, too.

3RD MAN
You're right -- he's the model.

DUKE
Absolutely!  Pure Horatio Alger...
Say...

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE playing the tape.

DUKE ON TAPE
... how much do you think he'd take
for the ape?

DUKE fast-forwards again -- searching... TRAFFIC NOISES.
SCREECH OF BRAKES.

VOICE ON TAPE
Holy God!...

A TERRIBLE GRINDING NOISE.

EXT. CAR RENTAL AGENCY - NIGHT

RENTAL AGENT
Holy God!, how did this happen?

DUKE
They beat the shit out of it.

RENTAL AGENT
The top's completely jammed!

The CAR RENTAL AGENT wrestles with the trashed car.

DUKE
Yeah, something's wrong with the
motor...

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE ON TAPE
... The generator light's been on
red ever since I drove the thing
into Lake Mead on a water test...

99.


A HUGE SPLASH...

The tape's gone too far.

DUKE
No, no.  Shit...

DUKE races the tape BACKWARDS... Then, SIRENS HOWL.

DUKE ON TAPE
Where's the ape?  I'm ready to
write a check.

INT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS BAR - NIGHT

DUKE is standing in the middle of A SEMI-DESTROYED BAZOOKO
CIRCUS REVOLVING BAR.  Mirrors are broken.  People are
recovering from some kind of battle.  THE BAR SPINS MADLY.
DUKE IS INSANELY WIRED.

3RD MAN
Forget it, he just attacked an old
man... he took a bite out of the
bartender's head!  The cops took
the ape away.

DUKE
Goddamnit!  What's the bail?  I
want that ape!  I've already
reserved two first-class seats on
the plane.

DUKE (V/O)
There was every reason to believe
that we had been heading for
trouble, that we'd pushed our luck
a bit far...

INT. WHITE WHALE ON THE STREETS OF LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

GONZO SCREAMS ABUSE out of the window at a Ford alongside
the VOMIT STREAKED WHITE WHALE.  DUKE MAKES A SUPERHUMAN
EFFORT TO STAY ON THE ROAD.

GONZO
Hey there!  You folks want to buy
some heroin?

In the Ford: TWO COUPLES -- MIDDLE-AGED AMERICAN FACES
FROZEN IN SHOCK -- stare straight ahead.  GONZO leans out --
close to them.

100.


GONZO
Hey, honkies!  Goddamnit, I'm
serious.  I want to sell you some
pure fucking smack!

No reaction.

GONZO
Cheap heroin!  This is the real
stuff!  You won't get hooked.  I
just got back from Vietnam!  This
is scag, folks.  Pure scag!

The lights change.  The Ford bolts.  DUKE keeps pace with
them.

GONZO
Shoot!  Fuck!  Scag!  Blood!
Heroin!  Rape!  Cheap!  Communist!
Jab it right in your fucking
eyeballs!

The MAN IN THE BACK SEAT suddenly loses control -- enraged,
lunges against the glass, trying to get at GONZO.

MAN IN CAR
You dirty bastards!  Pull over and
I'll kill you!  God damn you!  You
bastards!

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

BACK IN THE SUITE:

The tapes runs:

MAN IN CAR ON TAPE
You dirty bastards!

An ugly squeal of brakes.

GONZO ON TAPE
Shit, he was trying to bite me!  I
shoulda maced the fucker!

DUKE fast forwards the tape.  The TAPE MANGLES -- the sounds
ski to a halt...

DUKE grabs the nearest tool -- uses it to hook out the tape,
then realizes... IT'S GONZO'S RAZOR-SHARP FOLDING KNIFE... A
CHILLING MOMENT...

DUKE turns the knife over... THERE'S A DRIED CRIMSON SPOT ON
THE BLADE... OR IS IT DRIED MASHED POTATOES?

101.


READ ON TO FIND OUT!

DUKE
(remembering)
Back door beauty!

DUKE (V/O)
The mentality of Las Vegas is so
grossly atavistic that a really
massive crime often slips by
unrecognized.

DUKE SCRAPS A LITTLE OF THE CRUST -- TASTES IT...

DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
The possibility of physical and
mental collapse is very real... No
sympathy for the devil; keep that
in mind.  Buy the ticket, take the
ride...

HE HEARS THE SOUNDS OF SOMEONE BEHIND BEATEN UP...

VOICE OFF
Shit!  Faggot!  Bastard!

EXT. NORTH STAR COFFEE LOUNGE - NIGHT

WHACK!  SHADOWY FIGURES beat up a MAN -- give him A GOOD
KICKING.  BRUTAL AND UGLY.

DUKE (V/O)
North Vegas is where you go when
you've fucked up once too often on
The Strip and when you're not even
welcome in the cut-rate Downtown
places.

PAN to reveal a seedy diner -- THE NORTH STAR CAFE in the
background.  Through the window -- DUKE and GONZO sit at the
counter.

INT. NORTH STAR COFFEE LOUNGE - NIGHT

DUKE (V/O)
The North Star Coffee Lounge seemed
like a fairly safe haven from our
storms.  No hassles, no talk.  Just
a place to rest and regroup.  I
wasn't even hungry.

GONZO stuffs a hamburger down PAYING NO ATTENTION TO THE
BEATING going on outside the window.  Duke reads a newspaper.

102.


DUKE (V/O)
There was nothing in the atmosphere
of the North Star to put me on my
guard...

GONZO
(to WAITRESS)
Two glasses of ice water with ice.

The WAITRESS brings the ice water.

DUKE (V/O)
She looked like a burnt out
caricature of Jane Russell.  She
was definitely in charge here...

GONZO gulps down his glass of water and hands her a napkin.

DUKE (V/O)
He did it very casually, but I knew
that our peace was about to be
shattered.

DUKE
What was that?

GONZO shrugs.

The WAITRESS stands at the end of the counter with her back
to them while she ponders the napkin... She turns.

WAITRESS
What is this?

GONZO
A napkin.

THE WAITRESS slams the napkin down on the counter.

WAITRESS
Don't give me that bullshit!  I
know what it means!  You goddamn
fat pimp bastard.

GONZO
That's the name of a horse I used
to own.  What's wrong with you?

WAITRESS
You sonofabitch!  I take a lot of
shit in this place, but I sure as
hell don't have to take it off a
SPIC PIMP!

103.


GONZO GOES VERY VERY STILL AT THIS...

DUKE (V/O)
Jesus.  I thought, what's happening?

DUKE picks up the napkin.  On it is printed in careful red
letters: "BACK DOOR BEAUTY?"

DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
The question mark was emphasized.

WAITRESS
(screams)
Pay your bill and get the hell out!
You want me to call the cops?

GONZO
Spic pimp?

GONZO's hand goes inside his shirt.  He PULLS OUT THE RAZOR-
SHARP HUNTING KNIFE.

GONZO KEEPS HIS EYES ON THE WAITRESS.  He walks about six
feet down the aisle and lifts the receiver of the pay phone.
He SLICES IT OFF, then brings the receiver back to his stool
and sits down.

DUKE (V/O)
I was stupid with shock -- not
knowing whether to run or start
laughing.

GONZO
(casual)
How much is the lemon meringue pie?

DUKE (V/O)
Her eyes were turgid with fear, but
her brain was functioning on some
basic motor survival level.

WAITRESS
(blurting -- on automatic)
Thirty-five cents!

GONZO
(laughing)
I mean the whole pie.

The WAITRESS MOANS.  GONZO places a $5 BILL on the counter.

GONZO
Let's say five dollars.  Okay?

104.


GONZO walks round the counter TAKING THE PIE OUT OF THE
DISPLAY CASE.

DUKE (V/O)
The sight of the blade had triggered
bad memories.  The glazed look in
her eyes said her throat had been
cut.  She was still in the grip of
paralysis when we left.

DUKE IS ROOTED TO THE SPOT.

GONZO urges him out the door.  The camera retreats with them.

The WAITRESS STANDS THERE -- PETRIFIED.  Alone in a lousy
bar at night.

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE's face as he stares at the knife -- remembering...

GONZO (V/O)
Drive!  Drive!  Drive!  We have
fifteen fucking minutes to get me
on that plane!

EXT. ROAD ON OUTSKIRTS OF LAS VEGAS - DAY

The WHITE WHALE, looking like shit -- it's TOP HALF UP,
TORN, SLAPPING IN THE WIND -- ROARS THROUGH AN INTERSECTION
as the light turns red.

DR. GONZO FRANTICALLY PAWS OVER A MAP.

DUKE drives -- SILENT AND FURIOUS -- sick to his stomach
with the PSYCHOTIC GONZO.

GONZO
What are you doing?  You were
supposed to turn back there!

DUKE (V/O)
We had abused every rule that Vegas
lived by -- burning the locals,
abusing the tourists, terrifying
the help.  The only chance now, I
felt, was the possibility that we'd
gone to such excess that nobody in
the position to bring the hammer
down on us could possibility
believe it.

DUKE suddenly SLAMS ON THE BRAKES.

105.


GONZO
Jesus Christ!!!

There, crossing the road in front of them, is LUCY -- her
paintings under her arm -- looking lost.  SHE LOOKS UP WITH
A VAGUE SENSE OF RECOGNITION...

DUKE throws the car into a SKIDDING REVERSE TURN AND ROARS
OFF.

EXT. DESERT ROAD OUTSIDE LAS VEGAS - DAY

THE WHITE WHALE TEARS DOWN THE DESERTED FREEWAY.  GONZO
looks wildly around.

GONZO
Goddamnit!  We're lost!  What are
we doing out here on this
godforsaken road?

GONZO sees that THEY'RE RUNNING PARALLEL WITH THE AIRPORT
RUNWAY.

GONZO
The airport is over there!

DUKE
Never missed a plane yet.

DUKE HITS THE BRAKES and wrenches the wheel -- takes the
WHALE down into the grassy freeway divider.  WHEELS CHURNING,
HE MAKES IT UP THE OPPOSITE BANK, nose of the car straight
up, then BOUNCES ONTO THE FREEWAY and keeps going right OVER
A FENCE, dragging it through a cactus field and onto the
RUNWAY.

GONZO is FROZEN WITH FEAR -- GRIPPING THE DASHBOARD.  He
throws a worried look at DUKE.

DUKE
I'll drop you right next to the
plane.

They SPEED UNDER A PARKED AIRPLANE, SHOUTING ABOVE THE JET
ENGINE SCREAM.

GONZO
No!  I can't get out!  They'll
crucify me.  I'll have to take the
blame!

106.


DUKE
(irritatedly)
Ridiculous!  Just say you were
hitchhiking to the airport and I
picked you up.  You never saw me
before.  Shit, this town is full of
white Cadillac convertibles.  I
plan to go through there so fast
that nobody will even glimpse the
goddamn license plate.  You ready?

GONZO
Why not?  But for Christ's sake,
just do it fast!

EXT. AT THE AIRPLANE - DAY

DUKE SCREECHES UP in front of the DESERT AIR 727.  GONZO
JUMPS OUT -- HEADS FOR THE PLANE.

DUKE watches him go -- RELENTS.

DUKE
Hey!

GONZO stops -- turns.

DUKE
Don't take any guff from those
swine.  Remember, if you have any
trouble you can always send a
telegram to the Right People.

GONZO
Yeah... Explaining my Position.
Some asshole wrote a poem about
that once...

GONZO pauses.

GONZO
Probably good advice, if you have
shit for brains.

GONZO turns and RACES TOWARDS THE STEPS JUST AS HE IS ABOUT
TO ENTER THE PLANE HE PAUSES AND LOOKS BACK...SMILES...AND
LEANS FORWARD AND VOMITS.

DUKE (V/O)
There he goes -- one of God's own
prototypes -- a high powered mutant
of some kind never even considered
for mass production.  Too weird to
live and too rare to die.

107.


DUKE watches for a second then ROARS AWAY.  PULL BACK WITH
THE WHITE SHARK -- LEAVING THE AIRPLANE FAR BEHIND.

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE/APOCALYPSE - NIGHT

On the TV an airplane soars thru the sky.  Pull back to find
DUKE barricaded in GONZO'S BEDROOM.  He is typing on his
typewriter.

DUKE
We are all wired into a survival
trip now.  No more of the speed
that fueled that 60's.  That was
the fatal flaw in Tim Leary's trip.
He crashed around America selling
"consciousness expansion" without
ever giving a thought to the grim
meat-hook realities that were lying
in wait for all the people who took
him seriously...

DUKE records like A WAR CORRESPONDENT.  The CAMERA slowly
rises -- DUKE alone in the room with the TV SPEWING OUT
IMAGES OF WARS AND CIVIL UNREST OF THE 90'S.

DUKE
All those pathetically eager acid
freaks who thought they could buy
Peace and Understanding for three
bucks a hit.  But their loss and
failure is ours too.  What Leary
took down with him was the central
illusion of a whole life-style that
he helped create...

RISING HIGHER -- THE WALLS OF THE ROOM APPEAR TO BY 20 TO 30
FEET HIGH.  DUKE SEEMS TO BE AT THE BOTTOM OF A WELL... THE
CAMERA RISES UP THROUGH BROKEN TIMBERS...

DUKE
... a generation of permanent
cripples, failed seekers, who never
understood the essential old-mystic
fallacy of the Acid Culture: the
desperate assumption that somebody...
or at least some force -- is
tending the light at the end of the
tunnel.

HIGHER STILL -- DUKE ALONE IN THE ROOM -- AN ISOLATED BOX
SURROUNDED BY THE TWISTED METAL AND RUBBLE AND SMASHED NEON
SIGNS OF THE DEAD CITY -- A BLASTED LANDSCAPE WITHOUT
LIGHT -- SHARDS OF A CIVILIZATION.

108.


EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY

A BURNING FLARED-OUT SUN.  The camera pans down to DUKE
DRIVING THE WRECKED WHALE.  A piece of the fence flies out
of the back seat as he takes a bump.

DUKE (V/O)
There was only one road back to L.A.
US Interstate 15, just a flat-out
high speed burn through Baker and
Barstow and Berdoo, then on to the
Hollywood Freeway straight into
frantic oblivion: safety, obscurity,
just another freak in the Freak
Kingdom.

DUKE sees THE HARDWARE BARN, A RUSTIC OLD FARM BUILDING
facing the road with a single gas pump outside and a neon
sign that flashes beer.

DUKE
Ahhh.  Wonderful.

DUKE PULLS OFF THE ROAD and parks.  Gets out and walks in.

INT. HARDWARE BARN - BAKER, CALIFORNIA - DAY

DUKE enters the DARK, CLUTTERED INTERIOR.  Scattered all
about the store are BITS OF AMERICANA... OLD BARRELS, WAGON
WHEELS, WOODEN YOKES.  A STUFFED HORSE HANGS FROM THE
RAFTERS.  The sunlight shafts through high windows.  AN OLD
MAN is repairing an iron pot-bellied stove near the wooden
bar.  A NORMAN ROCKWELL PAINTING... ONLY REAL.

PROPRIETOR
What'll you have?

DUKE can't quite believe this place -- too good to be true.

DUKE
(doubtfully)
Ballantine Ale...?

THE PROPRIETOR serves the ale up ice cold.  DUKE SMILES AND
RELAXES.

DUKE
Hard to find it served like this
anymore.

As he drinks, DUKE toys with a rack of key chains -- LITTLE
AMERICAN ICONS... A REMINGTON COWBOY, A BUGS BUNNY, A TWEETY
PIE, BETTY BOOP, A BASEBALL PLAYER.  The logo on the rack
reads: AMERICAN DREAM KEY RINGS.

109.


PROPRIETOR
Where ya comin' from, young man?

DUKE
Las Vegas.

PROPRIETOR
A great town, that Vegas.  I bet
you had good luck there.  You're
the type.

DUKE
I know.  I'm a triple Scorpio.

PROPRIETOR
(trustingly)
That's a fine combination.  You
can't lose.

A LOVELY GIRL appears.  Seeing DUKE, she smiles.  CAN THIS
REALLY BE HIS LUCKY DAY?  She approaches him... and...
KISSES THE PROPRIETOR.

DUKE
(caught off guard... muttering)
Oh, my God!...

PROPRIETOR
(not understanding)
This is my granddaughter...

DUKE
(recovering)
Don't worry...
(leans forward in confidence)
... and I'm actually the District
Attorney from Ignoto County.
(winks)
Just another good American like
yourself.

A MOMENT.  THE PROPRIETOR'S SMILE DISAPPEARS.

Wordlessly the PROPRIETOR and his GRANDDAUGHTER go to the
back of the store -- GET ON WITH THEIR WORK -- IGNORING DUKE.

WHO FEELS ASHAMED.

DUKE puts some money down on the bar and SLOWLY LEAVES.

EXT. HARDWARE BARN - DAY

A CHASTENED DUKE approaches the vomit streaked WHITE WHALE.
Gets in -- sits there -- deflated -- miserable...

110.


A state bus draws up across from the Hardware Barn.

Somberly, DUKE watches as TWO YOUNG MARINES with duffel bags
step off -- chatting like TRUE BROTHERS...

DUKE switches on the ignition.  Something rolls off the
trembling dash... DUKE catches it...

ONE SINGLE BEAUTIFUL AMYL CAPSULE...

DUKE CRACKS THE AMYL -- INHALES.  THE RUSH MAKES HIM GASP --
TEETH BARED LIKE A MADMAN.

DUKE
HOLY SHIT!!!

DUKE GUNS THE ENGINE with a laugh -- leans out -- YELLS AT
THE MARINES.

DUKE
GOD'S MERCY ON YOU SWINE!

DUKE ROARS AWAY.  AN AMERICAN FLAG FLIES UP FROM THE DEBRIS
IN THE BACK SEAT, MADLY UNFURLING ITSELF AS IT SNAGS ON THE
CONVERTIBLE-TOP FRAME OF THE TRASHED WHITE WHALE!

AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!

The TWO MARINES look after him CONFUSED.

EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY

DUKE drives fast -- TEETH GRITTED IN FROZEN ECSTASY!!

DUKE CRANKS UP THE TAPE RECORDER.

DUKE (V/O)
My heart was filled with joy.  I
felt like a monster reincarnation
of Horatio Alger... a man on the
move... and just sick enough to be
totally confident.

The WHITE WHALE WIPES THE SCREEN BLACK.

AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!

END



Taking my time
Choosin' my line
Tryin' to decide what to do
Looks like my stop
Don't wanna get off
Got myself hung up on you

Seems to me
You don't want to talk about it
Seems to me
You just turn your pretty head and walk away

Places I've known
Things that I'm growin'
Don't taste the same without you
I got myself in
The worst mess I've been
And I find myself startin' ta doubt you

Seems to me
Talk all night, here comes the mornin'
Seems to me
You just forget what we said
And greet the day

Seems to me
You don't wanna talk about it
Seems to me
You just turn your pretty head and walk away

I've got ta cool myself down
Stompin' around
Thinkin' some words I can't name ya
Meet ya half way
Got nothin' to say
Still I don't s'pose I can blame ya

Seems to me
You don't want to talk about it
Seems to me
You just turn your pretty head and walk away

Walk away



[Verse 1]
When you're down and troubled and you need a helping hand
And nothing, whoa, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me and soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest nights

[Chorus]
You just call out my name
And you know where ever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer, or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there, yeah, yeah
You've got a friend

[Verse 2]
If the sky above you should turn dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind should begin to blow
Keep your head together and call my name out loud
Soon I will be knocking upon your door

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Hey, isn't it good to know that you've got a friend?
People can be so cold
They'll hurt you and desert you
Well, they'll take your soul if you let them
Oh yeah, but don't you let them

[Chorus]



I've been caught stealing;
Once when I was 5...
I enjoy stealing
It's just as simple as that
Well, it's just a simple fact
When I want something
I don't want to pay for it

I walk right through the door
Walk right through the door
Hey all right! If I get by, it's mine
Mine all mine!

My girl, she's one too
She'll go and get her a skirt
Stick it under her shirt
She grabbed a razor for me
And she did it just like that
When she wants something
She don't want to pay for it

She walk right through the door
Walk right through the door
Hey all right! If I get by, it's mine
Mine all mine!

We sat around the pile
We sat and laughed
We sat and laughed and
Waved it into the air!
And we did it just like that
When we want something
We don't want to pay for it

We walk right through the door
Walk right through the door
Hey, all right! If I get by, it's mine
Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine...



[Verse 1]
Jane says
I'm done with Sergio
He treats me like a ragdoll
She hides the television
Says I don't owe him nothing
But if he comes back again
Tell him to wait right here for me
Or just try again tomorrow
I'm gonna kick tomorrow
Gonna kick tomorrow

[Verse 2]
Jane says
Have you seen my wig around
I feel naked without it
She knows they all want her to go
But that's okay, man
She don't like them anyway
Jane says she's goin' away to Spain
When she gets my money saved
I'm gonna start tomorrow
I'm gonna kick tomorrow
Gonna kick tomorrow

[Bridge]
She gets mad
Starts to cry
She takes a swing but
She can't hit
She
Don't mean no harm
She just don't know
What else to do about it

[Verse 3]
Jane goes to the store at 8:00
She walk up on St. Andrews
She waits and gets her dinner there
She pulls her dinner from her pocket
Jane says
I've never been in love
I don't know what it is
She only knows if someone wants her
I want them if they want me
I only know they want me

[Bridge]
She gets mad
Starts to cry
She takes a swing but
She can't hit
She
Don't mean no harm
She just don't know
What else to do about it



[Verse 1]
In this world, if you read the papers, Lord
You know everybody's fighting on with each other
You got no one you can count on, baby
Not even your own brother

[Chorus]
So if someone comes along
He's going to give you some love and affection
I'd say get it while you can, yeah
Honey, get it while you can
Hey, hey, get it while you can
Don't you turn your back on love, no, no

[Verse 2]
Don't you know when you're loving anybody, baby
You're taking a gamble on a little sorrow
But then who cares, baby
Because we may not be here tomorrow, no

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Oh, get it while you can
Honey get it when you're going to want to need it dear, yeah yeah
Hey hey, get it while you can
Don't you turn your back on love
No no no, no no no no, get it while you can
I said hold on to somebody when you get a little lonely, dear

[Outro]
Hey hey, hold on to that man's heart
Yeah, get it, want it, hold it, need it
Get it, want it, need it, hold it
Get it while you can, yeah
Honey get it while you can, baby, yeah
Hey hey, get it while you can



You say that it's over baby, Lord
You say that it's over now
But still you hang around me, come on
Won't you move over

You know that I need a man, honey Lord
You know that I need a man
But when I ask you to you just tell me
That maybe you can

Please don't you do it to me babe, no!
Please don't you do it to me baby
Either take this love I offer
Or honey let me be

I'm not quite ready for walking, no no no no
I'm not quite ready for walking
And what are you going to do with your life
Life all just dangling?

Oh yeah, make up your mind, honey
You're playing with me, hey hey hey
Make up your mind, darling
You're playing with me, come on now!
Now either be my loving man
I said let me honey, let me be, yeah!

You say that it's over baby, Lord
You say that it's over now
But still you hang around me, come on
Won't you move over

You know that I need a man, honey Lord
You know that I need a man
But when I ask you to you just tell me
That maybe you can

Please don't you do it to me babe, no!
Please don't you do it to me baby
Either take this love I offer
Or honey let me be

I said won't you, won't you let me be?
Honey, you're teasing me
Yeah, you're playing with my heart, dear
I believe you're toying with my affections, honey

I can't take it no more baby
And furthermore, I don't intend to
I'm just tired of hanging from the end of a string, honey
You expect me to fight like a goddamned mule
Wah, wah, wah, wah, honey



Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on
Didn't I make you feel like you were the only man? Yeah
An' didn't I give you nearly everything that a woman possibly can?
Honey, you know I did
And, and each time I tell myself that I, well I think I've had enough
But I'm gonna, gonna show you baby, that a woman can be tough
I want you to come on, come on, come on, come on and take it
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
Oh, oh, break it
Break another little bit of my heart now, darling, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, have a
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby
Well you know you got it, if it makes you feel good
Oh, yes indeed
You're out on the streets looking good
And baby deep down in your heart I guess you know that it ain't right
Never, never, never, never, never, never hear me when I cry at night
Babe and I cry all the time
But each time I tell myself that I, well I can't stand the pain
But when you hold me in your arms, I'll sing it once again
I'll say come on, come on, come on, come on and take it
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
Oh, oh, break it
Break another little bit of my heart now, darling, yeah
Oh, oh, have a
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby
Well you know you got it, child, if it makes you feel good
I need you to come on, come on, come on, come on and take it
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
Oh, oh, break it
Break another little bit of my heart, now darling, yeah, c'mon now
Oh, oh, have a
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby
You know you got it
Take it, take another little piece of my heart now, baby
Oh, oh, break it
Break another little bit of my heart, now darling, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, have a
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby, hey
You know you got it, child, if it makes you feel good



[Verse]
Summertime, time, time
Child, the living's easy
Fish are jumping out
And the cotton, Lord
Cotton's high, Lord, so high

Your daddy's rich
And your mama is so good-looking, baby
She's looking good now
Hush, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
No, no, no, no, don't you cry
Don't you cry!

One of these mornings
You're going to rise, rise up singing
You're going to spread your wings
Child, and take, take to the sky
Lord, the sky

[Outro]
But until that morning
Honey, n-n-nothing's going to harm you now
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Don't you cry
Cry



Hit it!

It was thirty days around the horn
The captain says it's a thirty-five more
The moon looks mean and the crew ain't staying
"There's gonna be some blood" is what they're all saying

It's a shakedown cruise (Shakedown, shakedown cruise)
And I was just another fool (Shakedown, shakedown cruise)
There ain't no easy way out (Shakedown, shakedown cruise)
They're gonna shake you 'til you shout, hey, hey (Shakedown, shakedown cruise)

They treat you like a dog, but you're only human
You miss your home, Lord, you miss that woman
The captain laughs, he says, "You boys want some sex?
You can squeeze the sails, you can lick the decks"

It was a shakedown cruise (Shakedown, shakedown cruise)
I guess I just was born to lose (Shakedown, shakin' out the blues)
They tell you life is going cheap (Shakedown, shakedown cruise)
I got myself in pretty deep (Shakedown, shakedown cruise)

(Starlight lost in the night)
(Drift away and it feels all right) And it feels all right
(Starlight alone in the night)
(Drift away and it feels all right) And it feels all right
I guess it feels all right

The fever's hot, the winds are blowin' cold
The captain's crazy eye puts the fear in your soul
I heard somebody cryin', "Lord, let this end
You know I'll never go to sea again"

It was a shakedown cruise (Shakedown, shakedown cruise)
And now we're sendin' out the news (Shakedown, shakin' out the blues)
There ain't no victory at sea (Shakedown, shakedown cruise)
Unless it's mutiny (Shakedown, shakin' in my shoes)

Now if I don't get off alive, it's just as well
I'll be waking up in heaven, 'cause I've been through hell
On this shakedown cruise
They call it a shakedown cruise
Aw, shake me down, boy

(Shakedown, shakedown cruise)
(Shakedown, shakin' out the blues)
It was a shakedown cruise
(Shakedown, shakedown cruise)
It got me shakin' in my shoes
(Shakedown, shakin' in my shoes)
And now I'm feelin' kinda blue
(Shakedown, shakedown cruise)
Whoo!
(Shakedown, shakin' out the blues)

Shakedown cruise
(Shakedown, shakedown cruise)
I said, shake me down, boys
(Shakedown, shakin' in my shoes)
Whoo!
(Shakedown, shakedown cruise)



Ooh, yeah

(Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do)

Sha la la la la la, my lady
In the sun with your hair undone
Can you hear me now
Callin' your name from across the bay?
A summer's day laughin' and a-hidin'
Chasin' love out on Thunder Island

(Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do)
Hey, hey, hey, hey
(Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do)

She was the color of the Indian summer
And we shared the hours without number
Until one day when the sky turned dark
And the winds grew wild
Caught by the rain and blinded by the lightning
We rode the storm out there on Thunder Island

I held her close
Until the storm passed
And we fell down laughing in the wet grass
Both our bodies drying in the sunshine
Sweet sunshine

So, sha la la la la la, my lady
In the sun with your dress undone
Now every mile away and every day
Cuts a little bit deeper
I'll remember the nights in the cool sand
Makin' love out on Thunder Island

(Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do)
Hey, hey, hey, hey
(Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do)
Goodbye, Thunder Island
(Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do)

[Verse 1:]
When the truth is found to be lies
And all the joy within you dies

[Chorus:]
Don't you want somebody to love, don't you
Need somebody to love, wouldn't you
Love somebody to love, you better
Find somebody to love

[Verse 2:]
When the garden flowers baby are dead, yes and
Your mind, your mind is so full of red

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Your eyes, I say your eyes may look like his
Yeah, but in your head, baby, I'm afraid you don't know where it is

[Chorus]

[Verse 4:]
Tears are running down and down and down your breast
And your friends, baby they treat you like a guest

[Chorus]



One pill makes you larger
And one pill makes you small
And the ones that mother gives you
Don't do anything at all
Go ask Alice
When she's ten feet tall

And if you go chasing rabbits
And you know you're going to fall
Tell 'em a hookah smoking caterpillar
Has given you the call...
Call Alice
When she was just small

When the men on the chessboard
Get up and tell you where to go
And you've just had some kind of mushroom
And your mind is moving low
Go ask Alice
I think she'll know

When logic and proportion
Have fallen sloppy dead
And the White Knight is talking backwards
And the Red Queen's off with her head
Remember what the Dormouse said
Feed your head
Feed your head
Feed your head



You know, it's been a long, long road
Since I packed up and left on my own
And I carry a heavy load
Just trying get back to her heart

I sure ain't got no home
I seem to find love where I ramble
And when it's time to go
I hear that voice again, saying

Find your way back
Find your way back to her heart
Find your way back
Find your way back to her heart

Leave a message with the rain
You can find me where the wind blows
The snow across the pain
And the frost upon the heart

(You got no place to be
Still you wonder where you're going)
And why I had to leave
I hear a voice, it says to me

Find your way back
Find your way back to her heart
Find your way back
Find your way back to her heart
To her heart
C'mon

I know it's too late now
But, I wish I could go back in time
And start all over somehow
And get it right from the start

Find your way back
Find your way back to her heart
Find your way back
Find your way back to her heart

Find your way back (find your way back)
Find your way back
Find your way back (find your way back)
Find your way back
Find your way back (find your way back)
Find your way back
Find your way back (find your way back)
Find your way back



Jane, you say it's all over for you and me, girl
There's a time for love and a time for letting it be, baby
Jane you're playing a game called, hard to get by its real name
Making believe that you just don't feel the same
Oh Jane

Jane, you're playing a game you never can win, girl
You're staying away so I'll ask you where you've been, baby
Like a cat and a mouse (cat and a mouse)
From door to door and house to house
Don't you pretend you don't know what I'm talking about

Were all those nights we spent together, hey hey
Only because you didn't know better
I gotta know
Jane you're playing a game, you're playing a game, playing a game

Oh Jane, you're playing a game of hide and go seek
Jane, you're playing for fun but I play for keeps, yes I do
(Jane, Jane, Jane) That's a game on me, yeah
(Jane, Jane, Jane) So plain to see
(Jane, Jane, Jane) Janey, Janey, Janey, Janey, Janey
(Jane, Jane, Jane) Why you fooling with me, me, me
(Jane, Jane, Jane)
(Jane, Jane, Jane)
(Jane, Jane, Jane)
(Jane, Jane, Jane)



I want to ride the tiger
I want to ride the tiger
It will be black and white in the dead of night
Eyes flashing in the clear moonlight
I want to ride the tiger

It's like a tear in the hands of a western man
Tell you about salt, carbon and water
But a tear to a chinese man
He'll tell you about sadness and sorrow or the love of a man and a woman

I want to ride the tiger
I want to sail through the risin' sun for you and you
We got something to learn from the other side
Something to give, we got nothing to hide
I want to ride the tiger

Black wants out of the streets
Yellow wants the country
Red wants the country back
And white wants out of this world
Sing - sing to the sky
I want to ride the tiger
I want to ride the tiger

Look to the summer of seventy-five
All the world is gonna come alive
Do you want to ride the tiger?

It's like a tear in the hands of a western man
Tell you about salt, carbon and water
But a tear to an oriental man
He'll tell you about sadness and sorrow or the love of a man and a woman



We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

Say you don't know me or recognize my face
Say you don't care who goes to that kind of place
Knee deep in the hoopla, sinking in your fight
Too many runaways eating up the night

Marconi plays the mambo, listen to the radio
Don't you remember?
We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

Someone's always playing corporation games
Who cares, they're always changing corporation names
We just want to dance here, someone stole the stage
They call us irresponsible, write us off the page

Marconi plays the mambo, listen to the radio
Don't you remember?
We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

It's just another Sunday
In a tired old street
Police have got the choke hold, oh
Then we just lost the beat

Who counts the money underneath the bar?
Who rides the wrecking ball into our guitars?
Don't tell us you need us 'cause we're the ship of fools
Looking for America, coming through your schools

(I'm looking out over that Golden Gate bridge on another gorgeous sunny Saturday and I'm seein' that bumper to bumper traffic.)
Don't you remember? (remember)

(Here's your favorite radio station, in your favorite radio city, the city by the bay, the city that rocks, the city that never sleeps.)

Marconi plays the mambo, listen to the radio
Don't you remember?
We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city (oh)
We built this city on rock and roll

A woman on the radio talked about revolution
When it's already passed her by
Bob Dylan didn't have this to sing about
You know it feels good to be alive

I was alive and I waited, waited
I was alive and I waited for this

Right here, right now
There is no other place I want to be
Right here, right now
Watching the world wake up from history

I saw the decade in, when it seemed
The world could change at the blink of an eye
And if anything
Then there's your sign of the times

I was alive and I waited, waited
I was alive and I waited for this

Right here, right now

I was alive and I waited, waited
I was alive and I waited for this

Right here, right now
There is no other place I want to be
Right here, right now
Watching the world wake up from history
Right here, right now
There is no other place I want to be
Right here, right now
Watching the world wake up from history
Right here, right now
There is no other place I want to be
Right here, right now
Watching the world wake up from history

Cold hard bitch
Just a kiss on the lips
And I was on my knees

Sitting on a park bench
Eyeing little girls with bad intent
Snot running down his nose
Greasy fingers smearing shabby clothes
Hey Aqualung
Drying in the cold sun
Watching as the frilly panties run
Hey Aqualung
Feeling like a dead duck
Spitting out pieces of his broken luck
Whoa Aqualung

Sun streaking cold
An old man wandering lonely
Taking time
The only way he knows
Leg hurting bad
As he bends to pick a dog-end
He goes down to the bog
And warms his feet

Feeling alone
The army's up the road
Salvation a la mode and
A cup of tea
Aqualung my friend
Don't start away uneasy
You poor old sod, you see, it's only me

Do you still remember
December's foggy freeze?
When the ice that
Clings on to your beard was
Screaming agony (Hey!)
And you snatch your rattling last breaths
With deep-sea-diver sounds
And the flowers bloom like
Madness in the spring

Sun streaking cold
An old man wandering lonely
Taking time the only way he knows
Leg hurting bad
As he bends to pick a dog-end
He goes down to the bog and warms his feet

Ohohoho

Feeling alone
The army's up the road
Salvation a la mode and
A cup of tea
Aqualung my friend
Don't start away uneasy
You poor old sod, you see, it's only me

Dee dee dee dee
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee

Aqualung, my friend
Don't you start away uneasy

{verse 1 refrain}



{Intro}

Walking through forests of palm tree apartments
Scoff at the monkeys who live in their dark tents
Down by the waterhole
Drunk every Friday
Eating their nuts
Saving their raisins for Sunday
Lions and tigers
Who wait in the shadows
They're fast but they're lazy, and sleep in green meadows

Let's bungle in the jungle
Well, that's all right by me
I'm a tiger when I want love
But I'm a snake if we disagree

Just say a word and the boys will be right there
With claws at your back to send a chill through the night air
Is it so frightening to have me at your shoulder?
Thunder and lightning couldn't be bolder
I'll write on your tombstone, I thank you for dinner
This game that we animals play is a winner

Let's bungle in the jungle
Well, that's all right by me
I'm a tiger when I want love
But I'm a snake if we disagree

{Bridge}

The rivers are full of crocodile nasties
And He who made kittens put snakes in the grass
He's a lover of life but a player of pawns
Yes, the King on His sunset lies waiting for dawn
To light up His Jungle as play is resumed
The monkeys seem willing to strike up the tune

Let's bungle in the jungle
Well, that's all right by me
I'm a tiger when I want love
But I'm a snake if we disagree

Let's bungle in the jungle
Well, that's all right by me
I'm a tiger when I want love
But I'm a snake if we disagree



Who would be a poor man, a beggarman, a thief --
If he had a rich man in his hand
And who would steal the candy
From a laughing baby's mouth
If he could take it from the money man

Cross-eyed Mary
Goes jumping in again
She signs no contract
But she always plays the game

Dines in Hampstead village
On expense accounted gruel
And the jack-knife barber
Drops her off at school

Laughing in the playground --
Gets no kicks from little boys:
Would rather make it with a letching grey
Or maybe her attention is drawn by Aqualung
Who watches through the railings as they play

Cross-eyed Mary finds it hard to get along
She's a poor man's rich girl
And she'll do it for a song
She's a rich man stealer
But her favour's good and strong:
She's the Robin Hood of Highgate --
Helps the poor man get along



[Verse 1]
Oh Father high in heaven
Smile down upon your son, yeah
Who's busy with his money games, oh!
His women and his gun
Oh Jesus save me!

[Verse 2]
And the unsung Western hero
Killed an Indian or three, yeah
And then he made his name in Hollywood, oh!
To set the white man free
Oh Jesus save me!

[Bridge]
If Jesus saves, well He'd better save Himself
From the gory glory seekers who use His name in death
Oh Jesus save me!

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Well, I saw him in the city
And on the mountains of the moon, yeah
His cross was rather bloody, oh!
He could hardly roll His stone
Oh Jesus save me!



[Intro]
Happy, and I'm smiling
Walk a mile to drink your water
You know I'd love to love you
And above you there's no other
We'll go walking out
While others shout of war's disa(aa)ster
Oh, we won't give in
Let's go living in the past

[Bridge]
Once I'd used to join in
Every boy an' girl was my friend
Now there's revolution
But they don't know what they're fighting
Let us close our eyes
Outside their lives go on much fa(aa)ster
Oh, we won't give in
We'll keep living in the past

[Bridge]
Once I'd used to join in
Every boy an' girl was my friend
Now there's revolution
But they don't know what they're fighting
Let us close our eyes
Outside their lives go on much fa(aa)ster
Oh, we won't give in
We'll keep living in the past

Oh, we won't give in
Let's go living in the past
Oh, no, no, we won't give in
Let's go living in the past

[[Outro]



[Intro]

In the shuffling madness
Of the locomotive breath
Runs the all-time loser
Headlong to his death
He feels the piston scraping
Steam breaking on his brow

Old Charlie stole the handle
And the train it won't stop going
No way to slow down

Oh, oh!

He sees his children jumping off
At the stations - one by one
His woman and his best friend
In bed and having fun
He's crawling down the corridor
On his hands and knees

Old Charlie stole the handle and
The train it won't stop going
No way to slow down

Hey, hey!

[flute solo]

He hears the silence howling
Catches angels as they fall
And the all-time winner
Has got him by the balls
Oh, he picks up Gideon's Bible
Open at page one

I said, God, he stole the handle and
The train it won't stop goin'
No way to slow down
No way to slow down
No way to slow down
No way to slow down
No way to slow down
No way to slow down



Nothing is easy
Though time gets you worrying
My friend, it's OK
Just take your life easy
And stop all that hurrying
Be happy my way

When tension starts mounting
And you've lost count
Of the pennies you've missed
Just try hard and see why they're not worrying me
They're last on my list
Nothing's easy

Nothing is easy, you'll find
That the squeeze won't turn out so bad
Your fingers may freeze, worse things happen at sea
There's good times to be had
So if you're alone and you're down to the bone
Just give us a play
You'll smile in a while and discover
That I'll get you happy my way
Nothing's easy



Well the dawn was coming
Heard him ringing on my bell
He said, My name's the teacher
That is what I call myself
And I have a lesson
That I must impart to you
It's an old expression
But I must insist it's true

Jump up, look around
Find yourself some fun
No sense in sitting there hating everyone
No man's an island and his castle isn't home
The nest is full of nothing when the bird has flown

So I took a journey
Threw my world into the sea
With me went the teacher
Who found fun instead of me

Hey man, what's the plan, what was that you said?
Sun-tanned, drink in hand, lying there in bed
I try to socialize but I can't seem to find
What I was looking for, got something on my mind

Then the teacher told me
It had been a lot of fun
Thanked me for his ticket
And all that I had done

Hey man, what's the plan, what was that you said?
Sun-tanned, drink in hand, lying there in bed
I try to socialize but I can't seem to find
What I was looking for, got something on my mind



[PART ONE]

[1. Really Don't Mind / See There a Son Is Born (0:00 - 5:00)]

[Verse 1]
Really don't mind if you sit this one out
My word's but a whisper, your deafness a shout
I may make you feel but I can't make you think
Your sperm's in the gutter, your love's in the sink
So you ride yourselves over the fields
And you make all your animal deals
And your wise men don't know how it feels

[Refrain]
To be thick as a brick

[Verse 2]
And the sand-castle virtues are all swept away
In the tidal destruction, the moral melee
The elastic retreat rings the close of play
As the last wave uncovers the newfangled way
But your new shoes are worn at the heels
And your suntan does rapidly peel
And your wise men don't know how it feels

[Refrain]
To be thick as a brick

[Verse 3]
And the love that I feel
Is so far away
I'm a bad dream
That I just had today
And you shake your head
And say it's a shame

[Verse 4]
Spin me back down the years
And the days of my youth
Draw the lace and black curtains
And shut out the whole truth
Spin me down the long ages
Let them sing the song

[Verse 5]
See there! A son is born
And we pronounce him fit to fight
There are black-heads on his shoulders
And he pees himself in the night
We'll make a man of him
Put him to a trade
Teach him to play Monopoly
And how to sing in the rain

[3:36 - 5:00 - Instrumental]

[2. The Poet and the Painter (5:00 - 10:29)]

[5:00 - 6:09 - Instrumental]

[Verse 6]
The Poet and the Painter
Casting shadows on the water
As the sun plays on the infantry
Returning from the sea
The do-er and the thinker
No allowance for the other
As the failing light illuminates
The mercenary's creed
The home fire burning
The kettle almost boiling
But the master of the house
Is far away
The horses stamping
Heir warm breath clouding
In the sharp and frosty morning
Of the day
And the poet lifts his pen
While the soldier sheaths his sword

[Refrain 2]
And the youngest of the family
Is moving with authority
Building castles by the sea
He dares the tardy tide
To wash them all aside, oh

[7:21 - 9:21 - Instrumental]

[Verse 7]
The cattle quietly grazing
At the grass down by the river
Where the swelling mountain water
Moves onward to the sea
The builder of the castles
Renews the age-old purpose
And contemplates the milking girl
Whose offer is his need
The young men of the household
Have all gone into service
And are not to be expected
For a year
The innocent young master
Thoughts moving ever faster
Has formed the plan
To change the man he seems
And the poet sheaths his pen
While the soldier lifts his sword

[Refrain 2]
And the oldest of the family
Is moving with authority
Coming from across the sea
He challenges the son
Who puts him to the run

[3. What Do You Do When the Old Man's Gone? / From the Upper Class (10:29 - 15:54)]

[Verse 8]
What do you do when the old man's gone
Do you want to be him?
And your real self sings the song
Do you want to free him?
No one to help you get up steam
And the whirlpool turns you way off-beam

[11:52 - 13:16 - Instrumental]

[Verse 9]
I've come down from the upper class
To mend your rotten ways
My father was a man-of-power
Whom everyone obeyed

[Verse 10]
So come on all you criminals!
I've got to put you straight
Just like I did with my old man
Twenty years too late

[14:00 - 15:26 - Instrumental]

[Verse 11]
Your bread and water's going cold
Your hair is too short and neat
I'll judge you all and make damn sure
That no-one judges me

[4. You Curl Your Toes in Fun / Childhood Heroes / Stabs Instrumental (15:54 - 22:40)]

[Verse 12]
You curl your toes in fun
As you smile at everyone
You meet the stares, you're unaware
That your doings aren't done
And you laugh most ruthlessly
As you tell us what not to be
But how are we supposed to see
Where we should run?

[Verse 13]
I see you shuffle in the courtroom with
Your rings upon your fingers
And your downy little sidies
And your silver-buckle shoes
Playing at the hard case
You follow the example
Of the comic-paper idol
Who lets you bend the rules

[Verse 14]
So, come on ye childhood heroes!
Won't you rise up from the pages
Of your comic-books, your super crooks
And show us all the way
Well! Make your will and testament
Won't you join your local government?
We'll have Superman for president
Let Robin save the day

[Verse 15]
You put your bet on number one
And it comes up every time
The other kids have all backed down
And they put you first in line
And so you finally ask yourself
Just how big you are
And you take your place in a wiser world
Of bigger motor cars
And you wonder who to call on

[Verse 16]
So! Where the hell was Biggles
When you needed him last Saturday?
And where were all the sportsmen
Who always pulled you though?
They're all resting down in Cornwall
Writing up their memoirs
For a paper-back edition
Of the Boy Scout Manual

[20:23 - 22:40 - Instrumental]

[PART TWO]

[5. See There a Man Is Born / Clear White Circles (22:40 - 28:38)]

[Verse 17]
See there! A man is born
And we pronounce him fit for peace
There's a load lifted from his shoulders
With the discovery of his disease
We'll take a child from him
Put it to the test
Teach it to be a wise man
And how to fool the rest

[24:04 - 26:11 - Instrumental]

[Verse 18: Spoken]
We will be geared to the average, rather than the exceptional
God is an overwhelming responsibility
We walked through the maternity ward
And saw 218 babies wearing nylons
It says here that cats are on the upgrade
Upgrade? Hipgrave
Oh, Mac

[Verse 19]
In the clear white circles of morning wonder
I take my place with the lord of the hills
And the blue-eyed soldiers stand slightly discoloured
In neat little rows sporting canvas frills
With their jock-straps pinching, they slouch to attention
While queuing for sarnies at the office canteen
Saying: "How's your granny?" and good old Ernie
He coughed up a tenner on a premium bond win

[6. Legends and Believe in the Day (28:38 - 35:13)]

[Verse 20]
The legends worded in the ancient tribal hymn
Lie cradled in the seagull's call
And all the promises they made
Are ground beneath the sadist's fall

[Verse 21]
The poet and the wise man stand
Behind the gun, behind
And signal for the crack of dawn
Light the sun, light the sun

[Refrain 3]
Do you believe in the day?
Do you believe in the day?

[Verse 22]
The Dawn Creation of the Kings
Has begun, has begun
Soft Venus, lonely maiden brings
The ageless one, the ageless one

[Refrain 3]
Do you believe in the day?
Do you believe in the day?

[Verse 23]
The fading hero has returned
To the night, to the night
And fully pregnant with the day
Wise men endorse the poet's sight

[Refrain 3]
Do you believe in the day?
Do you believe in the day?

[33:37 - 35:13 - Instrumental]

[7. Tales of Your Life (35:13 - 40:37)]

[Verse 24]
Let me tell you the tales of your life
Of your love and the cut of the knife
The tireless oppression, the wisdom instilled
The desire to kill or be killed
Well, let me sing of the losers who lie
In the street as the last bus goes by
The pavements are empty: the gutters run red
While the fool toasts his god in the sky

[Refrain 4]
So come all ye young men who are building castles!
Kindly state the time of the year
And join your voices in a hellish chorus
Mark the precise nature of your fear

[Verse 25]
Let me help you pick up your dead
As the sins of the father are fed
With the blood of the fools and the thoughts of the wise and
From the pan under your bed
Well, let me make you a present of song
As the wise man breaks wind and is gone
While the fool with the hour-glass is cooking his goose
And the nursery rhyme winds along

[Refrain 4]
So! Come all ye young men who are building castles!
Kindly state the time of the year
And join your voices in a hellish chorus
Mark the precise nature of your fear
See! The summer lightning casts its bolts upon you
And the hour of judgement draweth near
Would you be the fool stood in his suit of armour
Or the wiser man who rushes clear

[8. Childhood Heroes Reprise (40:37 - 43:46)]

[Verse 14 Reprise]
So, come on ye childhood heroes!
Won't you rise up from the pages
Of your comic-books, your super crooks
And show us all the way
Well! Make your will and testament
Won't you join your local government?
We'll have Superman for president
Let Robin save the day

[Verse 16 Reprise]
So! Where the hell was Biggles
When you needed him last Saturday?
And where were all the sportsmen
Who always pulled you though?
They're all resting down in Cornwall
Writing up their memoirs
For a paper-back edition
Of the Boy Scout Manual

[Verse 1 Reprise]
So you ride yourselves over the fields
And you make all your animal deals
And your wise men don't know how it feels

[Refrain]
To be thick as a brick



The old Rocker wore his hair too long
Wore his trouser cuffs too tight
Unfashionable to the end --- drank his ale too light
Death's head belt buckle --- yesterday's dreams ---
The transport caf' prophet of doom
Ringing no change in his double-sewn seams
In his post-war-babe gloom
Now he's too old to Rock'n'Roll but he's too young to die
He once owned a Harley Davidson and a Triumph Bonneville
Counted his friends in burned-out spark plugs
And prays that he always will
But he's the last of the blue blood greaser boys
All of his mates are doing time:
Married with three kids up by the ring road
Sold their souls straight down the line
And some of them own little sports cars
And meet at the tennis club do's
For drinks on a Sunday --- work on Monday
They've thrown away their blue suede shoes
Now they're too old to Rock'n'Roll and they're too young to die
So the old Rocker gets out his bike
To make a ton before he takes his leave
Up on the A1 by Scotch Corner
Just like it used to be
And as he flies --- tears in his eyes ---
His wind-whipped words echo the final take
And he hits the trunk road doing around 120
With no room left to brake
And he was too old to Rock'n'Roll but he was too young to die
No, you're never too old to Rock'n'Roll if you're too young to die



{Intro}

If I could save time in a bottle
The first thing that I'd like to do
Is to save every day till eternity passes away
Just to spend them with you

If I could make days last forever
If words could make wishes come true
I'd save every day like a treasure and then
Again, I would spend them with you

But there never seems to be enough time
To do the things you want to do, once you find them
I've looked around enough to know
That you're the one I want to go through time with

{Bridge}

If I had a box just for wishes
And dreams that had never come true
The box would be empty, except for the memory of how
They were answered by you

But there never seems to be enough time
To do the things you want to do, once you find them
I've looked around enough to know
That you're the one I want to go through time with

[Verse 1]
If you can just get your mind together
Then come on across to me
We'll hold hands, and then we'll watch the sunrise
From the bottom of the sea

[Chorus]
But first, are you experienced?
Have you ever been experienced?
Well, I have

[Verse 2]
I know, I know you probably scream and cry
That your little world won't let you go
But who in your measly little world
Are you trying to prove that
You're made out of gold and, eh, can't be sold

[Chorus]
So uh, are you experienced?
Have you ever been experienced?
Well, I have

[Verse 3]
Let me prove to you
Trumpets and violins I can hear in distance
I think they're calling our names
Maybe now you can't hear them, but you will (haha)
If you just take hold of my hand

[Chorus]
Oh, but are you experienced?
Have you ever been experienced?
Not necessarily stoned, but beautiful

Here comes Dolly Dagger
Her love's so heavy, going to make you stagger
Dolly Dagger, she drinks her blood from a jagged edge
Been riding broomsticks since she was fifteen
Blow out all the other witches on the scene
She got a bull whip, just as long as your life
Her tongue can even scratch
The soul out of the devil's wife

Well, i seen her in action at the players choice
Turn all the love men into donut boys
Hey red hot momma, you'd better step aside
This chick's gonna turn you to a block of ice
Look out

Her love so heavy gonna make you stagger baby
Dolly Dagger
She drinks the blood from a jagged edge

Her love's so heavy, gonna make you stagger

Hey Joe

[Verse 2]
I'm going down to shoot my old lady
You know, I caught her messing around with another man
I'm going down to shoot my old lady
You know, I caught her messing around with another man
And that ain't too cool

[Verse 3]
Hey Joe

You shot her down to the ground

[Intro]
Yeah, sing the song, bro

[Verse 1]
If the sun refused to shine
I don't mind, I don't mind
If the mountains fell in the sea
Let it be, it ain't me
Alright, I got my own world to look through
And I'm not going to copy you

[Verse 2]
Now if a 6 turned out to be 9
I don't mind, I don't mind
If all the hippies cut off all their hair
I don't care, I don't care
Dig, cause I got my own world to live through
And I ain't going to copy you

[Bridge] {spoken}
White-collared conservatives flashing down the street
Pointing their plastic finger at me
They're hoping soon, my kind will drop and die
But I'm going to wave my freak flag high
Wave on, wave on

[Verse 3]
Fall mountains, just don't fall on me
Go ahead on Mr. Businessman, you can't dress like me
Nobody knows what I'm talking about
I've got my own life to live
I'm the one that's going to have to die
When it's time for me to die
So let me live my life the way I want to

[Outro]
Sing on brother
Play on drummer



[Instrumental]



[Verse 1]
Manic depression is touching my soul
I know what I want but I just don't know
How to, go about getting it
Feeling, sweet feeling
Drops from my fingers, fingers
Manic depression is catching my soul

[Verse 2]
Woman so weary, the sweet cause in vain
You make love, you break love
It's all the same
When it's, when it's over, mama

[Chorus]
Music, sweet music
I wish I could caress, caress, caress
Manic depression is a frustrating mess

[Verse 3]
Well, I think I'll go turn myself off
And go on down
All the way down
Really ain't no use in me hanging around
In your kind of scene

[Chorus]
Music, sweet music
I wish I could caress, and kiss, kiss
Manic depression is a frustrating mess



Purple haze all in my brain
Lately things don't seem the same
Acting funny but I don't know why
Excuse me while I kiss the sky

Purple haze all around
Don't know if I'm coming up or down
Am I happy or in misery
What ever it is that girl put a spell on me

Help me help me
Oh I don't know

Purple haze all in my eyes
Don't know if it's day or night
You've got me blowin, blowin my mind
Is it tomorrow or just the end of time

Who knows?
Help me
Oh yeah
Come on know
Help me
Help me



[Verse]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's about the time we'd like to present you to the electric church
And baby if you would you all listen to our notes
Here, here in our sins, playing
Instead of rapping like I am now
Then maybe I'll well maybe this is good enough
What you think we stick with songs
It's all freedom

There's a red house, over yonder baby
That's where my baby stays
Lord, there's a red house over yonder, baby
Lord, that's where my baby stays

I haven't been home to see my baby
In about a ninety-nine and one half days
It's about time to see her

[Outro][x2]
Wait a minute something's wrong, babe
Lord, have mercy, this key won't unlock this door



[Verse 1]
Everyday of the week, I'm in a different city
If I stay too long, the people try to pull me down, you know what I mean?
They talk about me like a dog, talking about the clothes I wear
But they don't realize they're the ones who's square

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, and that's why, Lord, you can't hold me down
I don't want to be tied down
I got to move on
Hey!

[Chorus]
I said
Stone free, yeah, to do what I please
Stone free, I said, to ride the breeze
Stone free, yeah I can't stay
I got to, got to, got to get away
Yeah, turn me loose, baby

[Verse 2]
Listen to this one last thing
Women here, women there, try to keep me in a plastic cage
But they don't realize it's so easy to break
Yeah but sometimes I can't
Feel my heart kind of getting hot
That's when I got to move, before I get caught

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Got to be free, got to be free
Got to be free
I just want to please you, but I please me
Hey, yeah!

[Chorus]

Miscellaneous
And The Wind Cries Mary
After all the jacks are in their boxes
And the clowns have all gone to bed
You can hear happiness staggering on down the street
Footprints dress in red
And the wind whispers Mary
A broom is drearily sweeping
Up the broken pieces of yesterday's life
Somewhere a Queen is weeping
Somewhere a King has no wife
And the wind it cries Mary
The traffic lights they turn blue tomorrow
And shine their emptiness down on my bed
The tiny island sags downstream
'Cos the life that they lived is dead
And the wind screams Mary
Will the wind ever remember
The names it has blown in the past
And with this crutch, its old age and its wisdom
It whispers, "No, this will be the last."
And The Wind Cries Mary



[Spoken Intro]
Star fleet to scout ship, please give your position
Over
I am in orbit around the third planet from the star called the sun
Over
You mean it's the Earth?
Over
Positive. It is know to have some form of intelligent species. Over
I think we should take a look

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse]
Strange beautiful grass of green
With your majestic silver seas
Your mysterious mountains I wish to see closer
May I land my kinky machine?

[Instrumental Break]

Although your world wonders me
With your majestic and superior cackling hen
Your pickle I do not understand
So to you I shall put an end
Then you'll never hear surf music again

[Instrumental Outro]



Well, I'm a voodoo chile
Lord I'm a voodoo chile

Well, the night I was born
Lord I swear the moon turned a fire red
The night I was born
I swear the moon turned a fire red
Well my poor mother cried out "Lord, the gypsy was right!"
And I seen her fell down right dead
(Have mercy)

Well, mountain lions found me there waitin'
And set me on a eagles back
Well, mountain lions found me there
And set me on a eagles wing
(It's the eagles wing, baby, what did I say)
He took me past to the outskirts of infinity
And when he brought me back
He gave me a Venus witch's ring
Hey!
And he said "Fly on, fly on"
Because I'm a voodoo chile, baby, voodoo chile
Hey!

Well, I make love to you
And Lord knows you'll feel no pain
Say, I make love to you in your sleep
And Lord knows you felt no pain
(Have mercy)
'Cause I'm a million miles away
And at the same time I'm right here in your picture frame
(Yeah! What did I say now)
'Cause I'm a voodoo chile
Lord knows I'm a voodoo chile Yeah!

(Yeah, but I say now yeah)

Well my arrows are made of desire
From far away as Jupiter's sulfur mines
Say my arrows are made of desire, desire
From far away as Jupiter's sulfur mines
(Way down by the Methane Sea, yeah)
I have a humming bird and it hums so loud
You think you were losing your mind, hmmm...

Well I float in liquid gardens
And Arizona new red sand
(Yeah)
I float in liquid gardens
Way down in Arizona red sand

Well, I taste the honey from a flower named Blue
Way down in California
And the New York drowns as we hold hands

'Cause I'm a voodoo chile
Lord knows I'm a voodoo chile
Yeah!



Nibbling on sponge cake
Watching the sun bake
All of those tourists covered in oil
Strumming my six-string
On my front porch swing
Smell those shrimp, hey they're beginning to boil

Wasted away again in Margaritaville
Searching for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
But I know it's nobody's fault

I don't know the reason
I stayed here all season
Nothing to show but this brand new tattoo
But it's a real beauty
A Mexican cutie
How it got here I haven't a clue

Wasted away again in Margaritaville
Searching for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
Now I think, hell, it could be my fault

I blew out my flip-flop
Stepped on a pop top
Broke my leg twice I had to limp on back home
But there's booze in the blender
And soon it will render
That frozen concoction that helps me hang on
Hang on

Wastin’ away again in margaritaville
Searching for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there’s a woman to blame
But I know it’s my own damn fault
Yes and some people claim that there’s a woman to blame
And I know it’s my own damn fault



As the son of a son of a sailor
I went out on the sea for adventure
Expanding the view of the captain and crew
Like a man just released from indenture

As a dreamer of dreams and a travelin' man
I have chalked up many a mile
Read dozens of books about heroes and crooks
And I learned much from both of their styles

Chorus:
Son of a son, son of a son
Son of a son of a sailor
Son of a gun, load the last ton
One step ahead of the jailer

Now away in the near future
Southeast of disorder
You can shake the hand of the mango man
As he greets you at the border

And the lady she hails from Trinidad
Island of the spices
Salt for your meat, and cinnamon sweet
And the rum is for all your good vices

Haul the sheet in as we ride on the wind
That our forefathers harnessed before us
Hear the bells ring as the tight rigging sings
It's a son of a gun of a chorus

Where it all ends I can't fathom my friends
If I knew I might toss out my anchor
So I cruise along always searchin' for songs
Not a lawyer a thief or a banker

But a son of a son, son of a son
Son of a son of a sailor
Son of a gun, load the last ton
One step ahead of the jailer

I'm just a son of a son, son of a son
Son of a son of a sailor
The sea's in my veins, my tradition remains
I'm just glad I don't live in a trailer



I really do appreciate the fact you're sittin' here
Your voice sounds so wonderful
But your face don't look too clear
So, Barmaid, bring a pitcher, another round of brew
Honey, why don't we get drunk and screw

Why don't we get drunk and screw
I just bought a waterbed filled up for me and you
They say you are a snuff queen, Honey, I don't think that's true
So, why don't we get drunk and screw

Why don't we get drunk and screw
I just bought a waterbed filled up for me and you
They say you are a snuff queen, Honey, I don't think that's true
So, why don't we get drunk and screw



[Verse:1]
I don't give a damn 'bout my reputation
You're living in the past, it's a new generation
A girl can do what she wants to do and that's what I'm gonna do

[Hook]
An' I don't give a damn 'bout my bad reputation
Oh no, not me
[Verse:2]
An' I don't give a damn 'bout my reputation
Never said I wanted to improve my station
An' I'm only doin' good when I'm havin' fun
An' I don't have to please no one

[Hook]
An' I don't give a damn 'bout my bad reputation
Oh no, not me, oh no, not me

[Verse:3]
I don't give a damn 'bout my reputation
I've never been afraid of any deviation
An' I don't really care if you think I'm strange
I ain't gonna change

[Hook}
An' I'm never gonna care 'bout my bad reputation
Oh no, not me, oh no, not me
Pedal, boys!

[Verse:4]
An' I don't give a damn 'bout my reputation
The world's in trouble, there's no communication
An' everyone can say what they wanna to say
It never gets better, anyway

[Hook]
So why should I care about a bad reputation anyway?
Oh no, not me, oh no, not me

[Verse:5]
I don't give a damn 'bout my bad reputation
You're living in the past, it's a new generation
An' I only feel good when I got no pain
An' that's how I'm gonna stay

[Hook]
An' I don't give a damn 'bout my bad reputation
Oh no, not me, oh no, not me
Not me, not me



Ah, now I don't hardly know her
But I think I could love her

Crimson and clover

Ah, now when she comes walking over
Now I've been waitin' to show her

Crimson and clover, over and over

Yeah, my, my such a sweet thing
I wanna do everything
What a beautiful feeling

Crimson and clover, over and over

Crimson and clover, over and over
Crimson and clover, over and over
Crimson and clover, over and over
Crimson and clover, over and over



[Verse 1]
Midnight, gettin' uptight, where are you?
You said you'd meet me, now it's quarter to two
I know I'm hangin' but I'm still wantin' you
Hey Jack, it's a fact they're talkin' in town
I turn my back and you're messin' around
I'm not really jealous, don't like lookin' like a clown

[Pre-Chorus]
I think of you ev'ry night and day
You took my heart and you took my pride away

[Chorus]
I hate myself for loving you
Can't break free from the things that you do
I wanna walk but I run back to you
That's why I hate myself for loving you
Ow! Uh

[Verse 2]
Daylight, spent the night without you
But I've been dreamin' 'bout the lovin' you do
I'm over being angry 'bout the hell you put me through
Hey, man, bet you can treat me right
You just don't know what you was missin' last night
I wanna see you begging, say forget it just for spite

[Pre-Chorus]
I think of you ev'ry night and day
You took my heart and you took my pride away

[Chorus]
I hate myself for loving you
Can't break free from the things that you do
I wanna walk but I run back to you
That's why I hate myself for loving you
Ow! Uh

[Pre-Chorus]
I think of you ev'ry night and day
You took my heart and you took my pride away

[Chorus]
I hate myself for loving you
Can't break free from the things that you do
I wanna walk but I run back to you
That's why I hate myself for loving you
Ow! Uh

[Chorus]
I hate myself for loving you
Can't break free from the things that you do
I wanna walk but I run back to you
That's why I hate myself for loving you
Ow! Uh

[Outro]
I hate myself for loving you
I hate myself for loving you
I hate myself for loving you
I hate myself
I hate myself for loving you



[Verse 1]
I saw him dancin' there by the record machine
I knew he must a been about seventeen
The beat was goin' strong
Playin' my favorite song
An' I could tell it wouldn't be long
Till he was with me, yeah, me
And I could tell it wouldn't be long
Till he was with me, yeah, me, singin'

So put another dime in the jukebox, baby

So come and take your time and dance with me
Ow!

Hate to being so untrue

I want you to cry (Cry me a river)
Want you cry (Cry me a river)
All over me (Cry me a river)
I want you to cry (Cry me a river)
Yeah, over me (Cry me a river)
Hey, yeah, cry (Cry me a river)

You drove me nearly drove me out of my head
Never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
You were through with me

(Cry me a river)
Oh yeah (Cry me a river)
Want you to cry (Cry me a river)
Oh yeah (Cry me a river)
Oh, cry (Cry me a river)
Cry me a river (Cry me a river)

Told me love was too plebeian
You were through with me

Ah!

Cry me a river (I cried a river over you)
Over the mountain (I cried a river over you)

Let me (I cried a river over you)
Let me cry a river over you (One, two, three, four)

(Cry me a river, cry me a river)
(Cry me a river, cry me a river)
Yeah (Cry me a river, cry me a river)
(Cry) Cry a river over you



Seems I've got to have a change of scene
'Cause ev'ry night I have the strangest dreams;
Imprisoned by the way it could have been
Left here on my own or so it seems

I've got to leave before I start to scream
But someone locked the door and took the key
You feelin' alright
I'm not feelin' too good myself

Well, you feelin' alright
I'm not feelin' too good myself
Well boy, you sure took me for one big ride
And even now I sit and wonder why

That when I think of you I start myself to cry
I just can't waste my time, I must keep dry
Gotta stop believing in all your lies
'Cause there's too much to do before I die

You feelin' alright...
Don't get too lost in all I say
Yeah by the time, you know, I really felt that way
But that was then; Now, you know, it's today

I just can't get off so I'm here to stay
'Til someone comes along and takes my place
With a different name, oh, a different face
You feeling alright...

Baby take off your coat
Real slow
Take off your shoes
I'll take off your shoes
Baby, take off your dress
Yes, yes, yes

You can leave your hat on
You can leave your hat on
You can leave your hat on

Go over there, turn on the lights
All the lights
Come back here, stand on that chair
Get up woman, that's right
Raise your arms up in the air
And now shake 'em

You give me reason to live
You give me reason to live
You give me reason to live
You give me reason to live

Sweet darling
(You can leave your hat on)
Just leave your hat on, girl
A little wild man
(You can leave your hat on)
Leave your hat on
(You can leave your hat on)
(You can leave your hat on)

Suspicious minds are talkin'
They're tryin' to tear us apart
They don't believe in this love of mine
They don't know what love is

They don't know what love is
They don't know what love is
They don't know what love is
I know what love is

And baby, put it my way
(You can leave your hat on)
And just leave your hat on now
They don't wanna
(You can leave your hat on)
Won't you do that for me, babe?
(You can leave your hat on)
And just leave your hat on, girl
(You can leave your hat on)



[Verse 1]
Pretty women are walking with gorillas down my street
From my window I'm staring while my coffee goes cold
Look over there (Where?)
There, there's a lady that I used to know
She's married now or engaged or something, so I'm told

[Chorus]
Is she really going out with him?
Is she really gonna take him home tonight?
Is she really going out with him?
Cause if my eyes don't deceive me
There's something going wrong around here

[Verse 2]
Tonight's the night when I go to all the parties down my street
I wash my hair and I kid myself, I look real smooth
Look over there (Where?)
There, here comes Jeanie with her new boyfriend
They say that looks don't count for much
And so there goes your proof

[Chorus]
Is she really going out with him?
Is she really gonna take him home tonight?
Is she really going out with him?
Cause if my eyes don't deceive me
There's something going wrong around here

[Bridge]
But if looks could kill
There's a man there who is marked down as dead
Cause I've had my fill
Listen, you, take your hands from her head
I get so mean around the scene
Hey, hey, hey

[Chorus]
Is she really going out with him?
Is she really gonna take him home tonight?
Is she really going out with him?
Cause if my eyes don't deceive me
There's something going wrong around here



[Instrumental]



Instrumental



Sometimes I can't help the feeling that I'm
Living a life of illusion
And oh, why can't we let it be
And see through the hole in this wall of confusion
I just can't help the feeling I'm
Living a life of illusion

Pow! Right between the eyes
Oh, how nature loves her little surprises
Wow! It all seems so logical now
It's just one of her better disguises
And it comes with no warning
Nature loves her little surprises
Continual crisis

Hey, don't you know it's a waste of your day
Caught up in endless solutions
That have no meaning, just another hunch
Based upon jumping conclusions
Caught up in endless solutions
Backed up against a wall of confusion
Living a life of illusion



We get up early and we work all day
We put our time in cause we like to stay up
All night long
All night long

We keep on grinnin' 'til the weekend comes
Just a pinch between your cheek and gums
All night long
All night long

Start in the morning and get the job done
Take care of business and we have some fun
All night long
All night long

We like a long neck and a good old song
Turn it up and then we'll sing along
Sing along
Oh, we're stayin' up all night long

All night long
All night long
All night long
All night long

Songwriter:  Joe Walsh
