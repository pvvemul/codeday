[Pre-Chorus]
House so empty, need a centerpiece
20 racks a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face man I love my baby
You talking money, need a hearing aid
You talking bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain

[Chorus]

I’m a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done

Cut that ivory into skinny pieces

Let a nigga brag Pitt
Legend of the fall took the year like a bandit
Bought mama a crib and a brand new wagon
Now she hit the grocery shop looking lavish
Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan
Girls get loose when they hear this song
100 on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars

[Pre-Chorus]
House so empty, need a centerpiece
20 racks a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face man I love my baby

Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain

[Verse 1: Andrew Taggart]
Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much
And that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends
It was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

[Pre-Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

[Post-Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

[Verse 2: Halsey]
You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that Blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no call
Now I'm lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Halsey]
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

[Post-Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Halsey]
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Halsey]
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

[Post-Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Halsey]
We ain't ever getting older
(No, we ain't ever getting older)
We ain't ever getting older
(No, we ain't ever getting older)
We ain't ever getting older
(We ain't ever getting older)
We ain't ever getting older
(No, we ain't ever getting older)
(We ain't ever getting older)
(No, we ain't ever getting older)



[Intro: Swae Lee & Gucci Mane]
Black Beatles in the city
Be back immediately to confiscate the moneys
(Ear Drummers)
Rae Sremm, Guwop, Mike WiLL!
I sent flowers, but you said you didn't receive 'em
But you said you didn't need 'em (Mike WiLL!)

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinking
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Getting so gone I'm not blinkin'
What in the world was I thinkin'?
New day, new money to be made
There is nothin' to explain
I'm a fuckin' black Beatle, cream seats in the Regal
Rockin' John Lennon lenses, like to see ‘em spread eagle
Took a bitch to the club and let her party on the table
Screamin', "Everybody's famous!"
Like clockwork, I blow it all
And get some more
Get you somebody that can do both
Black Beatles got the babes belly rollin'
She think she love me, I think she trollin'

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Came in with two girls, look like strippers in their real clothes
A broke ho can only point me to a rich ho
A yellow bitch with green hair, a real weirdo
Black man, yellow Lamb', red light go
They seen that Guwop and them just came in through the side door
There's so much money on the floor we buyin' school clothes
Why you bring the money machine to the club for?
Pint of lean, pound of weed, and a kilo
I Eurostep past a hater like I'm Rondo
I upgrade your baby mama to a condo
Like Chapo servin' yayo to the gringos
Black Beatle, club close when I say so

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

[Verse 3: Slim Jxmmi]
She's a good teaser, and we blowin' reefer
Your body like a work of art, baby
Don't fuck with me, I'll break your heart, baby
D&G on me, I got a lot of flavor
15 hundred on my feet, I'm tryna kill these haters
I had haters when I was broke, I'm rich, I still got haters
I had hoes when I was broke, I'm rich, I'm still a player
I wear leather Gucci jackets like it's still the 80s
I've been blowin' OG Kush, I feel a lil' sedated
I can't worry about a broke nigga or a hater
Black Beatle, bitch, me and Paul McCartney related

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle



[Intro: D.R.A.M.]
Ain't no tellin' what I'm finna be on (aye, aye)
I'm beyond all that fuck shit, hey

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Hey, lil' mama, would you like to be my sunshine?
Nigga, touch my gang, we gon' turn this shit to Columbine
Ice on my neck, cost me ten times three
Thirty thousand dollars for a nigga to get flee
I just hit Rodéo, and I spent like ten Gs
I just did a show and spent the check on my mama
When I go on vacay I might rent out the Bahamas
And I keep like ten phones, damn, I'm really never home
All these niggas clones, tryna copy what I'm on
Nigga, get your own, tryna pick a nigga bone
Word to brother, Skip, boy, I had a good day
Metro PCS, trappin', boy I'm makin' plays
Fifty shades of grey, beat that pussy like Hulk Hogan
I know you know my slogan, if it ain't 'bout guap, I'm gone
Niggas hatin' 'cause I'm chosen, from the concrete I had rose
Shawty starin' at my necklace 'cause my diamonds really froze
Put that dick up in her pussy, bet she feel it in her toes
I'm a real young nigga from the six throwin' 'bows
I'm a real young nigga from the six throwin' 'bows
Real young nigga from the six throwin' 'bows

[Hook: D.R.A.M.]
In the middle of the party, bitch get off me
In the cut, I'm rollin' up my broccoli
Ya, I know your baby mama fond of me
All she want to do is smoke that broccoli
Whispered in my ear, she tryna leave with me
Said that I can get that pussy easily
Said that I can hit that shit so greasily
I'm a dirty dog, I did it sleazily

[Bridge: D.R.A.M.]
Ain't no tellin' what I'm finna be on
I'm beyond all that fuck shit
Ain't no tellin' what I'm finna be on
I'm beyond all that fuck shit

[Verse 2: D.R.A.M.]
I got companies and Pesos
I got people on my payroll
She don't do it 'less I say so
I don't smoke if it ain't fuego
I should sauce 'em up like Prego
Fettucini with Alfredo
All I wanted was the fame and every game they made on Sega
I was five or six years old when I had told myself, "Okay you're special"
But I treat you like my equal never lesser
I was twenty-six years old when we had dropped this one amazing record
Had the world steppin'
That's what I call epic
Couple summers later I got paper
I acquired taste for salmon on a bagel
With the capers on a square plate
At the restaurant with the "why you got to stare" face
To know I either ball or I record over the snare and bass
Rapper face, dread headed
Golden diamond teeth wearin'
They just mad 'cause I got that cheese, bitch, I keep dairy
Turnt up in the party, gettin' lit to Yachty
With a Spanish Barbie, word to my mami

[Hook: D.R.A.M.]
In the middle of the party, bitch get off me (Get off of me)
In the cut, I'm rollin' up my broccoli (My weed, my weed)
Ya, I know your baby mama fond of me (She fond of me)
All she want to do is smoke that broccoli
(My weed, my weed)
Whispered in my ear she trying to leave with me
(She vulnerable)
Said that I can let that pussy easily
(She fallin' for)
Said I can hit that shit so greasily (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
I'm a dirty dog I did it sleazily



[Intro: Kyla]
Baby, I like your style

[Verse 1: Drake]
Grips on your waist, front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe but I never run away
Even when I'm away
Oti, oti
There's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray

[Chorus: Drake]
That's why I need a one dance

Higher powers taking a hold on me

[Refrain: Kyla]
Baby, I like your style

Strength and guidance
All that I'm wishing for my friends
Nobody makes it from my ends

You know you gotta stick by me
Soon as you see the text, reply me
I don't wanna spend time fighting
We've got no time

[Chorus: Drake]
And that's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

Cause if you're down, I'll take it slow
Make you lose control
Where, where, where
Where, where, where, where
Oh yeah, very long time
Where, where, where
Back, up, back up and wine it, girl
Where, where, where, where
Cause if you're down
Back up, back up and
Cause if you're down
Back up, back up and
Cause if you're down
Back up, back up and

[Chorus: Drake]
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

We were burnin' on the edge of somethin' beautiful
Somethin' beautiful
Sellin' a dream
Smoke and mirrors keep us waitin' on a miracle
On a miracle

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]

Oh, it's been a hell of a ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go, never let me down

Don't you give up, nah, nah, nah

Know we're good enough

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Say go through the darkest of days

Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go, never let me down

[Intro: Future]
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon shoot you

[Hook: Big Sean]
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Don’t owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me 'cause I'm homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me ‘lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like a edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I’m never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out 'cause I’m enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time, mane
(Thank you God, God bless you, thank you so much)

[Hook: Big Sean]
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Look, I woke up in beast mode
With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though
(Never sold my soul, never will never have)
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory, I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything except worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I’m on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I’m Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga, I don’t act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga, I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot “count to ten” me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen court rooms and court sides, ain’t too many seen both sides
Nigga, fuck what you know
Nigga, I’m takin' back control
The underdog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off, so

[Hook: Big Sean]
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Outro: Kanye West & Big Sean]
Bounce back, bounce, bounce
Bounce back, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bitch, bounce (Yeah)
Is you a real one?
Is you a real one?
Real one
Real one
Is you a real one?
Real one
Real one
Don

I can see it in your eyes
'Cause they never tell me lies
I can feel that body shake
And the heat between your legs

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
You've been scared of love and what it did to you
You don't have to run, I know what you've been through
Just a simple touch and it can set you free
We don't have to rush when you're alone with me

I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe

So baby, I can make it right
You just got to let me try
To give you what you want

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
You've been scared of love and what it did to you
You don't have to run, I know what you've been through

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Nothing's that bad
If it feels good
So you come back
Like I knew you would
And we're both wild
And the night's young
And you're my drug
Breathe you in 'til my face numb
Drop it down to that bass drum
I got what you dream about
Nails scratchin' my back tatt
Eyes closed while you scream out
And you keep me in with those hips
While my teeth sink in those lips
While your body's giving me life
And you suffocate in my kiss
Then you said

[Pre-Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
I can't explain it
I love the pain
And I love the way your breath
Numbs me like novacaine
And we are
Always high
Keep it strange
Okay, yeah, I'm insane
But you the same
Let me paint the picture
Couch by the kitchen
Nothin' but your heels on
Losin' our religion
You're my pretty little vixen
And I'm the voice inside your head
That keeps telling you to listen to all the bad things I say
And you said

[Pre-Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

[Bridge: Camila Cabello]
The way we love, is so unique
And when we touch, I'm shivering
And no one has to get it
Just you and me
Cause we're just living
Between the sheets

[Pre-Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly & Camila Cabello]
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

And every time I go out, yeah

Even in my head you're still in my bed
Maybe I'm just a fool

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Do you think of me? Of what we used to be?

My friends are actin' strange, they don't bring up your name

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
(Oh hey)
No more “please stop”
No more hashtag boo'd up screenshots
No more tryin' make me jealous on your birthday
You know just how I made you better on your birthday, oh
Do he do you like this, do he woo you like this?
Do he lay it down for you, touch your poona like this?
Matter fact, never mind, we'll let the past be
May be his right now, but your body's still me, woah

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home

You all in my section tryna come to my session
We rollin' up pressure, you know that we flexin'
We bought all the bottles, we came with the models
Girl this a confession, I'm not like your exes

You can fly in whenever, now you undressin'

Made love in that Lexus, made love in that Lexus

[Intro]
Yo, bro, I think I had too much Hennessy, man
This Hennessy gettin' to me
I ain't gonna lie, I'm a little smizz
I'm a little drizz
But we in the club, man, OOOUUU

[Verse]
Yeah, they hate, but they broke though
And when it's time to pop they a no-show
Yeah, I'm pretty, but I'm loco
The loud got me movin' slow-mo
Ayo, Tweetie, where the hoes, bro?
Ayo, Keys, where the hoes though?
That other nigga, he a bozo
It's M.A, you don't know, ho?
We got liquor by the boatload (that Henny)
Disrespect the Lyfe, that's a no-no
All my niggas dressed in that rojo (Redlyfe)
I ride for my guys, that's the bro code
Baby gave me head; that's a low blow
Damn, she make me weak when she deep throat
I need a rich bitch, not a cheap ho
They be on that hate shit, I peep though
My brother told me: "Fuck 'em, get that money, sis!"
You just keep on grindin' on your hungry shit
Ignore the hate, ignore the fake, ignore the funny shit
‘Cause if a nigga violate, we got a hunnit clips (grrrrrrrah!)
And we go zero to a hundred quick (ooouuu)
We just them niggas you ain't fuckin' with (oh no)
Pockets on a chubby chick (ah)
And still go bag a thottie in some bummy shit (ooouuu)
Yerr, Eli, why they testin' me?
Like I don't always keep the hammer next to me
Like I ain't got a hitter to the left of me
Like we ain't in these streets more than Sesame
If that's your chick, then why she textin' me?
Why she keep calling my phone speaking sexually?
Every time I'm out, why she stressin' me?
You call her Stephanie? I call her Headphanie (OOOUUU)
I don't open doors for a whore
I just want the neck, nothin' more
Shawty, make it clap, make it applaud!
When you tired of your man, give me a call
Dyke bitches talking out they jaw
Next minute, calling for the law
This 9 will have 'em calling for the Lord
They ain't getting shmoney, so they bored
I could never lose, what you thought?
M.A got it on lock, man, of course
They say I got the juice, I got the sauce
These haters on my body, shake 'em off
Pussy, I'm a bully and a boss
I'm killing 'em, sorry for your loss (R.I.P.)
I just caught a body; Randy Moss
Now this year I'm really going off

[Outro]
OOOUUU, OOOUUU
These haters on my body, shake 'em off
OOOUUU, OOOUUU
Ah, these haters on my body, shake 'em off
OOOUUU, OOOUUU
These haters on my body, shake 'em off
I could never lose, what you thought?
What they thought?
I could never lose, what you thought?
This Henny got me, it got me sauced
This Henny got me, oh, it got me sauced
I could never lose, what you thought?
M.A got it on lock, man, of course
OOOUUU, OOOUUU

Woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name
Woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name
(Woke up, woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name)
Got up, thank the Lord for the day
Woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name
Woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name
(Woke up, woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name)

[Bridge: The Weeknd]
Got up, thank the Lord for the day
Woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name
Bitches in my new spot, crowdin' up my space
Had to check the safe, check the dresser for my chains
Got up, thank the Lord for the day
Woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name
Bitches in my new spot, crowdin' up my space
Had to check the safe, check the dresser for my chains

(Woke up, woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name)
You're paranoid

Right now I need a miracle
Hurry up now, I need a miracle
Stranded, reaching out

And boy, got me walkin' side to side, let them hoes know

And I know it's gonna get me in trouble
Just as long as you know you got me

Wrist icicle, ride dick, bicycle
Come through yo, get you this type of blow
If you wanna Minaj, I got a tricycle

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
All these bitches' flows is my mini-me
Body smoking, so they call me Young Nicki Chimney
Rappers in they feelings 'cause they feelin' me
Uh, I-I give zero fucks and I got zero chill in me
Kissing me, copped the blue box that say Tiffany
Curry with the shot, just tell 'em to call me Stephanie
Gun pop and I make my gum pop
I'm the queen of rap, young Ariana run pop

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
These friends keep talkin' way too much
Say I should give him up

[Verse 1]
I won't lie to you
I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off
But I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time
In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop

[Chorus]
I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can

[Verse 2]
I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me to
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need and this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do

[Chorus]
'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can

[Bridge]
Give me a sign
Take my hand, we'll be fine
Promise I won't let you down
Just know that you don't
Have to do this alone
Promise I'll never let you down

[Chorus]
'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can
Better than he can



[Intro: Drake & Young Thug]
Yeah
We got London On Da Track

[Verse 1: Drake]
This is all God's doin', man, you can't plan it
But if the devil's in the details, then I'm Satanic
'Bout to take over your city and you can't stand it
My accountant say you sinkin' like the Titanic
David Blaine last summer, man, you had to vanish
I get the hits like somebody pitchin' underhanded
Got my Spanish ting convinced that I know Spanish
Really, when she get to talkin', I don't understand it
You ain't own it right away, you had to wait on niggas
Man, I'm only 29, have some patience with us
Plus I never met nobody from my label, nigga
I just pop up with the music then they pay a nigga, yeah
Shit ain't been the same like before
I still love it but I used to love it more
FaceTime with my shawty on tour
And she textin' purple hearts 'cause she know that we at war, yuh

[Chorus: Drake & 21 Savage]
Niggas keep reachin' and dissin'
Can't afford mistakes, not on this end
Make me call my bros for assistance
You gon' make me call my bros for assistance
Niggas keep reachin' and dissin'
Put me in a fucked-up position (yah)
You gon' make me call my bros for assistance (21)
Make me call my bro (21, uh)

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
Baby, I'm a savage, I ain't romantic
When I come around, these rapper niggas start to panic
And they pockets goin' under like the Titanic
Got some head last night and it was outstandin'
They was hatin' on me then and they hatin' now (hatin' now)
She was playing with me then but she waitin' now (21, 21)
Used to sleep inside a den, I got acres now (mansion)
I was fighting' niggas then but I'm sprayin' now (blasting)
I don't pay no mind to no sneak diss (nope)
I won't spend a dime on a freak bitch (broke)
Niggas takin' cheap shots on some cheap shit (21)
They the type to stand in line for some free shit (broke bitch)
Baby girl gon' suck it till her jaws locked (suck it up)
She gon' make me put my bitch on call block (fuckin' up)
We the ones poppin', we the ones shoppin' (21)
We the one droppin' niggas, we the ones (we the ones)
They the ones duckin' when them heaters come (21, 21)
You that nigga snitchin' on your people, huh? (Shh)
21 Savage a.k.a. The Reaper, huh (21)
Pussy niggas gettin' shot for all that reachin', huh (ya dig?)

[Chorus: Drake & 21 Savage]
Niggas keep reachin' and dissin' (shut the fuck up)
Can't afford mistakes, not on this end (count the fuck up)
Make me call my bros for assistance (21)
You gon' make me call my bros for assistance (bros)
Niggas keep reachin' and dissin' (hol' up)
Put me in a fucked-up position (21)
Make me call my bros for assistance
Make me call my bro, don't

[Verse 3: Drake]
I don't need love, I'm the GOAT, I just hit the beat and float
And I'm sellin' out arenas but you puttin' on a show
I been tryna change life around for everyone I know
'Cause if I don't share the wealth
Then how the fuck we supposed to grow?
Mom's stressed, there's a lot of things we need
Chain smokin' in the house, it's hard to breathe
I used to have to hit my Ts with Febreze
Jordan pull up in the TL, now I'm cheese
I'ma turn this TSX into a Benz soon
I'ma see a lot of blessin's for my friends soon
150-inch screen in my bedroom
6'1", man, a nigga need some leg room
Shit ain't been the same like before
They ain't even wanna look up at the score
FaceTime with my shawty on tour
And she textin' purple hearts 'cause she know that we at war, yuh

[Chorus: Drake]
Niggas keep reachin' and dissin'
Can't afford mistakes, not on this end
Make me call my bros for assistance
You gon' make me call my bros for assistance
Niggas keep reachin' and dissin'
Put me in a fucked-up position
Make me call my bros for assistance
Make me call my bro, don't



[Verse 1: Camila]
I ain't worried 'bout nothin', I ain't wearin' na-nada

Put in them hours, I'ma make it harder
I'm sending pic after picture, I'ma get you fired

We don't need nobody, I just need your body
Nothin' but sheets in between us, ain't no getting off early

[Pre-Chorus: Dinah + Camila]
And I know you're always on the night shift
But I can't stand these nights alone

Cause baby, you're the boss at home

[Chorus: Lauren]

Oh yeah, girl go to work for me (Work for me)

Ride or die, she gon' go

So name a game to play, and I'll roll the dice, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh baby, look what you started

Is this gonna happen?
Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move
Before I make a move

[Chorus]
So baby come light me up, and maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but baby that's how I want it
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body
'cause I’m so into you, into you, into you

Got everyone watchin' us, so baby let's keep this secret
A little bit scandalous, but baby don’t let them see it
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body

[Intro: Drake]
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look...I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to ask you if you're okay
My friends always feel the need to tell me things
Seems like they're just happier than us these days
Yeah, these days I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, and last night I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
I don't know how to talk to you
I just know I found myself getting lost with you
Lately you just make me work too hard for you
Got me on flights overseas, and I still can't get across to you

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
And last night I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it

[Chorus: Drake & Rihanna]
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

[Verse 3: Drake]
Years go by too fast
I can't keep track
How long did we last?
I feel bad for asking
It can't end like this
We gotta take time with this
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Let me see if this is something I can fix
You got somebody other than me
Don't play the victim when you're with me
Free time is costing me more than it seems
Sacrificing things
And I wanna tell you my intentions
I wanna do the things that I mention
I wanna benefit from the friendship
I wanna get the late night message from you, from you
I put my hands around you
Gotta get a handle on you
Gotta get a handle on the fact that...

[Chorus: Drake & Rihanna]
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

[Outro: Popcaan]
Gyal a you mi waan

How many more days could I wait?
I made plans with you
And I won't let 'em fall through
I, I, I, I, I

[Hook: Drake]

And a bawl fi come inna mi apartment (Woi!)
Di gyal dem want di length and strength
Action speak louder than argument well

[Verse 4: Drake]
But you can't just diss and come tell man sorry
You can't listen to me talk and go tell my story, nah
It don't work like that when you love somebody
My old flex is my new flex now and we're workin' on it, yeah
And that's why I need
All the energy that you bring to me
My last girl would tear me apart
But she'd never wanna split a ting with me

[Hook: Drake]
But when it comes to you, you
I think I'd lie for you
I think I'd die for you
Do things when you want me too
Like controlla, controlla, yeah
Like controlla, controlla, yeah

[Bridge: Drake]
And I’m never on a waste ting shorty
I do it how you say you want it
Them girls, they just wanna take my money
They don't want me to give you nothing
They don't want you to have nothing
They don't wanna see me find your lovin'
They don't wanna see me
Smiling back when they pree (Jheeze!)

[Outro: Beenie Man]
Music a drop!
Gyal a whine up dem bumpa
Dis is di summa summa controlla
Drake from Canada, Beenie Man from Jamaica
Dah one yah a murda—Zagga!



[Chorus:  Rihanna]
Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watching her
But she's looking at you, oh, oh
You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh
You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh
You, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus:  Rihanna]

We go fast with the game we play
Who knows why it's gotta be this way?
We say nothing more than we need
I say "your place" when we leave

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watching her
But she's looking at you, oh, oh

[Post-Chorus:  Rihanna]
You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh

You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh
Oh, oh



[Verse 1]
I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

[Pre-Chorus]
Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

[Chorus 1]
I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

[Verse 2]
I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

[Chorus 2]
I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

[Bridge]
I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

[Chorus 3]
I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise till death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

[Outro]
Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go



[Verse 1: Phoebe Ryan & Andrew Taggart]
Fighting flames with fire
Hang onto burning wires
We don't care anymore
Are we fading lovers?
We keep wasting colors
Maybe we should let this go

[Pre-Chorus: Phoebe Ryan & Andrew Taggart]
We're falling apart, still we hold together
We've passed the end, so we chase forever
'Cause this is all we know
This feeling's all we know

[Chorus: Phoebe Ryan & Andrew Taggart]
I'll ride my bike up to the road
Down the streets right through the city
I'll go everywhere you go
From Chicago to the coast
You tell me, "Hit this and let's go
Blow the smoke right through the window"
'Cause this is all we know

[Post-Chorus: Phoebe Ryan & Andrew Taggart]
'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know

[Verse 2: Phoebe Ryan & Andrew Taggart]
Never face each other
One bed, different covers
We don't care anymore
Two hearts still beating
On with different rhythms
Maybe we should let this go

[Pre-Chorus: Phoebe Ryan & Andrew Taggart]
We're falling apart, still we hold together
We've passed the end, so we chase forever
'Cause this is all we know
This feeling's all we know

[Chorus: Phoebe Ryan & Andrew Taggart]
I'll ride my bike up to the road
Down the streets right through the city
I'll go everywhere you go
From Chicago to the coast
You tell me, "Hit this and let's go
Blow the smoke right through the window"
'Cause this is all we know

[Post-Chorus: Phoebe Ryan & Andrew Taggart]
'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know

Back the fuck up, you too little
Hit 'em with three like I'm Miller
I don't talk to no man in the middle
I don't talk to no man, I'm just kiddin'
But I did pay my sister's tuition
I feel lucky, I should play the lottery
Walkin' off with it like Sonny Liston
Mama told me I'm her brightest star
Mama told me don't hate on the law

Then I had to man up, I was wrong
I hate when we fight
She in love with the pipe
I draped her up in ice, I pour my four on ice
Birds in the trap sing Brian McKnight
Percocet and Codeine please don't take my life
She had a dream with Céline
So I bought it twice
Young nigga make it right back tonight
Girl you're so cute and your ass is nice
Drinkin' on four and I'm shootin' dice
Wrist polar bear, Klondike
And I'm loving all races, hell nah don't discriminize
Drinkin' on clean, sanitize
Ostritch seats with the frog eyes
If I ever call your phone baby
Best believe it's only one time
(Like Brrrrr)

[Hook: Starrah]
Pick up the phone, baby (Like brrrrr)
I know you're home, baby (Like brrrrr)
I'm in the zone, baby (Ohhhhhh)

Hittin' the block and I’m bleedin'
Throwin' that Rollie on you
I like the way you be freezin'



[Intro: Kyle + Lil Yachty]
Man, fuck
What's wrong Kyle?
Man, these kids, man, talkin' shit, makin' me feel bad
Man, fuck them kids, bro! Look around, bro, look at life
Man, you're right
Mmm, you see? You see these fine bitches over here?
Yeah, woah…
You see these trees man? You see this water?
I guess it is okay
Come on, man, you got so much more to appreciate, man
Man you know what, y-you're right…
You damn right I'm right, I can't remember a time I was god-damn wrong
Man, thanks, Lil' Boat
Hey man, that's what I'm here for

[Verse 1: Kyle]
I ain't been gettin' high...
Well maybe a little, baby, I don't wanna lie
I know when you text me, girl, I don't always reply
Well you're not an angel either, you can't even fly
I notice, you think that you know shit
All this shade that's comin' at me, I wonder who throws it
They can't see the vision, boy they must be out of focus
That's a real hot album homie, I wonder who wrote it, oh shit
Otay, pray them niggas go away
Always hella clowns around it look like Cirque Du Soleil
This is not the album either, these are just the throwaways
This shit still so cold when it drop, it's gonna be a mothafuckin' snow day
Ayy, boy is good and he knows it, he don't say it, he shows it
I'm just like DeRozan, if I shoot it, it goes in
I am in Cali just coastin', get 'em so wet they need coasters
I got a selfie with Oprah, I just ain't never post it
And I'm in my happy place posted, I ain't frown since '06
I ain't cried since '01, my pad like Six Flags and your house is no fun
You can come back to mine though, your friend ain't cute but it's fine though
We gon' end on a high note

[Chorus: Kyle]
I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind
Oh, I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind

[Refrain: Kyle]
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I...

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
She said she 21, I might have to I.D. that
All my bitches come in pairs like balls in my nutsack
I remember ridin' around the city in a Hatchback
Lookin' for a problem with my young goblins
I'ma send a model home with her neck throbbin'
I done made so much money that it's non-stoppin'
Got my brothers on my back like the last name
I remember tellin' everyone I couldn't be tamed
Woah, six months later I had snapped and now I'm in the game
Went from fake chains to diamonds in another lane
Went from "Can you take me here?" to screening out the lane
Went from "Damn this nigga lame" to remember my name
So I remember all the people who ain't fucked with me
They went to college, now all them niggas is history
Upgraded from gold to diamonds in my teeth
Riding deep in the van, like we lookin' for a mystery (Raggy!)
So don't fuck with me
No, lately I been livin' like luxury
Boat and Kyle stick together like piano keys
And on my mother's mother I won't fuck a bitch without a damn rubber

[Chorus: Kyle]
I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind
Oh, I...I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind

[Refrain: Kyle]
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I...

Mustard on the beat ho!

[Verse 1]
I was good on my own
That's the way it was
That's the way it was
You was good on the low
For a faded fuck
On some faded love
Shit, what the fuck you complaining for?
Feeling jaded, huh?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to you
Had some fun on the run though I'll give it to you

[Pre-Chorus]
But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?
Fuck ya white horse and ya carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you you could have it

[Chorus]
You needed me
Oooh, you needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But baby ooo, you needed me

[Verse 2]
You been rollin' around, shit I'm rollin' up
Light and roll it up
Break it down, like a pound, shit was never us
Shit was never us
That's the real, on the real, are you serious?
How you feel, how you feel?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to ya
Had some fun on the run though, I give it to ya

[Pre-Chorus]
But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?

Never told you you could have it

Oooh, you needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less

[Justin Bieber]
Everybody gets high sometimes
You know
What else can we do when
We're feeling low


So take a deep breath
And let it go
You shouldn't be
Drowning on your own


And if you feel you're sinking
I will jump right over
Into cold, cold
Water for you


And although time may take us
Into different places
I will still be
Patient with you


And I hope you know
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline, tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline, tonight


Cause we all get lost
Sometimes you know
It's how we learn
And how we grow


And I wanna lay with
Until I'm old
You shouldn't be fighting
On your own


And if you feel you're sinking
I will jump right over
Into cold, cold
Water for you


And although time may take us
Into different places
I will still be
Patient with you


And I hope you know
I won't let go (I won't let go, no, no, no more)
I'll be your lifeline, tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline, tonight

[MØ]
Come on, Come on
Save me from the rocking boat
I just wanna stay afloat
I'm all alone


And I hope, I hope
Someone's gonna take me home
Somewhere I can rest my soul (rest my soul)
I need to know, you won't let go


[Justin Bieber]
(I won't let go, no, no, no more)
I'll be your lifeline, tonight
[MØ]
You won't let go


[Justin Bieber]
I'll be your lifeline, tonight
I won't let go
I won't let go, go

[Verse 1]
She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made

[Chorus]
But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

[Verse 2]
She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
She says "beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything"
"What's a little bit of hunger?"
"I can go a little while longer," she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurting, let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within

[Chorus]
There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

[Bridge]
No better you than the you that you are
No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're living
No better life than the life we're living
No better time for your shine, you're a star
No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful

[Chorus]
And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

You've got a hold on me
Don't even know your power
I stand a hundred feet
But I fall when I'm around ya
Show me an open door
And you go and slam it on me
I can't take anymore

[Hook]
I'm saying
Baby, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?

[Verse 2]
I'd drive through the night
Just to be near you, baby
Heart open, testify
Tell me that I'm not crazy
I'm not asking for a lot
Just that you're honest with me
And my pride, is all I got

[Hook]
I'm saying
Baby, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me?
I'm a puppet on your strings
And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?

[Bridge]
Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice
Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice

[Hook]
Oh, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me?
I'm a puppet on your string
And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free
I'm begging you for mercy, mercy
I'm begging you, begging you, please, baby
I'm begging you for mercy, mercy
Ooh, I'm begging you, I'm begging you



[Intro]
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope,  sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I don't want no picture with the president
I just wanna talk to the man
Speak for the boys in the bando
And my nigga never walkin' again
Apologize if I'm harpin' again
I know these things happen often
But I'm back on the scene
I was lost in a dream as I write this
The team down in Austin
I been buildin' me a house
Back home in the South, ma
Won't believe what it's costin'
And it's fit for a king, right?
Or a nigga that could sing
And explain all the pain that it cost him
My sixteen should've came with a coffin
Fuck the fame and the fortune
Well, maybe not the fortune
But one thing is for sure though
The fame is exhaustin'
That's why I moved away, I needed privacy
Surrounded by the trees and Ivy League
Students that's recruited highly
Thinkin' "You do you and I do me"
Crib has got a big 'ol back 'ol yard
My niggas stand outside and pass cigars
Filled with marijuana, laughin' hard
Thankful that they friend's a platinum star
In the driveway there's no rapper cars
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Welcome to the Sheltuh, this is pure
We'll help you if you've felt too insecure
To be the star you always knew you were
Wait, I think police is at the door

[Hook]
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope sellin' dope
The neighbors think I'm—neighbors think I'm—
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Well motherfucker, I am

[Verse 2]
Some things you can't escape:
Death, taxes, and a ra-
-cist society that make
Every nigga feel like a candidate
For a Trayvon kinda fate
Even when your crib sit on a lake
Even when your plaques hang on a wall
Even when the president jam your tape
Took a little break just to annotate
How I feel, damn, it's late
I can't sleep cause I'm paranoid
Black in a white man territory
Cops bust in with the army guns
No evidence of the harm we done
Just a couple neighbors that assume we slang
Only time they see us we be on the news, in chains, damn

[Bridge]
Don't follow me
Don't follow me
Don't follow me
Don't follow me

[Hook]
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
The neighbors think I'm...neighbors think I'm—
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Well motherfucker, I am

[Outro]
I am, I am, I am, I am
Well, motherfucker, I am
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
I am, I am, I am
Well, motherfucker, I am
So much for integration
Don't know what I was thinkin'
I'm movin' back to south side
So much for integration
Don't know what I was thinkin'
I'm movin' back to south side

But I know you need to get done, done, done, done

[Verse 1]
When you're low
And your knees can't rise
You feel helpless
And you're looking to the sky
Some people would say
To accept their fate
Well, if this is fate then we'll find a way to cheat

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh we'll say a little prayer
But, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh if the answer isn't fair

[Chorus]
You know you can call on me
When you need somebody
You know you can call on me
When you can't stop the tears from falling down (d-down)
You know you can call on me
Call on me, darling
You know you can call on me
You can't stop the tears from falling down (d-down)

[Verse 2]
When you're weary
And the road is dark
And I'll guide you
With the beating of my heart
And if the cavalry
And the help don't come
Well, then we'll find a way
To dodge a smoking gun

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh we'll say a little prayer
But, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh if the answer isn't fair (then call on me)

[Chorus]
You know you can call on me
When you need somebody
You know you can call on me
When you can't stop the tears from falling down (d-down)
You know you can call on me
Call on me, darling
You know you can call on me
You can't stop the tears from falling down (d-down)

[Bridge]
When you, you need someone (Just call on me)
You need somebody to cling to (Call on me)
When you, you need someone (Just call on me)
You need somebody to dry your tears
When you, you need someone (You can call me)
You need somebody to cling to (Just call on me)

Broke ass nigga get a clue
All these niggas know how we do

Still on a paper chase that don't ever stop
Everybody with me family, that's how we rock
Party at the mansion, we bout to flood the spot

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Ask around about her
She don't get emotional
Kill off all her feelings
That's why she ain't approachable
She know her pussy got a fanbase
A couple niggas with a suitcase
Suit and tie niggas who play roleplay
When it comes to money she play no games

[Pre-Hook: The Weeknd]
She lick it up just like a candy
She wanna make them leave their family
She trying to live a life so fancy
She wanna pull up in a Bentley
She ain't got time for lovin'
Louis Vuitton her husband
She rather die in lusting
She rather die in the club, 'til she

[Hook: The Weeknd & Future]
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
You know how she get down, pop it for a check now
Six feet under, six, six feet under
Six feet under, six, six feet under
Six feet under she gon' kill me for that paper
Not the type to fuck around, gonna turn that ass around

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
She don't depend on anybody
Know just what to do with her own body
Counting all that money like a hobby
She don't give a fuck about nobody
And she got her whole crew poppin'
And she bend it over like she got no back bone
Got a couple niggas blinging up a trap phone
She don't need nobody waiting back home, she got it

[Pre-Hook: The Weeknd]
She lick it up just like a candy
She wanna make them leave their family
She trying to live a life so fancy
She wanna pull up in a Bentley
She ain't got time for lovin'
Louis Vuitton her husband
She rather die in lusting
She rather die in the club, 'til she

Real love's hard to find

So she don't waste her time, oooh
You ain't gon' catch her crying
She ain't gon' lose her mind
She ain't gon' lose her mind
'Til she..

[Outro: Future & The Weeknd]
Six feet under she gon' kill me for that paper ('Til she)
Six feet under she gon' kill me for that paper ('Til she)
Six feet under she gon' kill me for the paper

[Intro]
Just the guitar?
Okay, cool

[Verse 1]
This was all you, none of it me
You put your hands on, on my body and told me
Mmm, told me you were ready
For the big one, for the big jump
I'd be your last love, everlasting, you and me
Mmm, that was what you told me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free

[Chorus]
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

[Verse 2]
I was too strong, you were trembling
You couldn't handle the hot heat rising (rising)
Mmm, baby, I'm still rising
I was running, you were walking
You couldn't keep up, you were falling down (down)
Mmm, there's only one way down

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free, oh

[Chorus]
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

[Bridge]
If you're ready, if you're ready
If you're ready, I am ready
If you're ready, if you're ready
We both know we ain't kids no more
No, we ain't kids no more

I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free

If you're ready, if you're ready
(Send my love to your new lover)
If you're ready, are you ready?
(Treat her better)
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more



[Verse 1]
Pulling me further, further than I've been before
Making me stronger, shaking me right to the core
Oh, I don't know what's in the stars
Never heard it from above, the world isn't ours
But I know what's in my heart, if you ain't mine I'll be torn apart

[Chorus]
I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have
I know it'll kill me when it's over
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now
I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have
I know it'll kill me when it's over
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now

[Post-Chorus]
Love me now, love me now
Oh, oh, love me now, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Love me now, love me now
Oh, I want you to love me now

[Verse 2]
Something inside us knows there's nothing guaranteed
Yeah, girl, I don't need you to tell me that you'll never leave, no
When we've done all that we could to turn darkness into light, turn evil to good
Even when we try so hard for that perfect kind of love, it could all fall apart

[Chorus]
And who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone?
Oh I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have
And I know it'll kill me when it's over
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now

[Post-Chorus]
Love me now, love me now
Oh, love me now, oh, oh, oh
Love me now
Love me now, love me now
Love me now

[Bridge]
Oh I don't know how the years will go down, it's alright
Let's make the most of every moment tonight

[Chorus]
I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have
I know it'll kill me when it's over
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now
I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have
I know it'll kill me when it's over
I don't wanna think about it, I just wanna love you now

[Post-Chorus]
Love me now, love me now
Oh, oh, love you now, oh, oh, oh
Love me now, love me now
Love you now
Oh, love you now, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Verse 2]
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Bridge]
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Intro: The Weeknd]
Uh, uh, uh, uh-uh, uh, yeah, like

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I ran out of tears when I was 18
So nobody made me but the main streets
'Cause too many people think they made me
Well, if they really made me then replace me
Homeless to Forbes List, these niggas bring no stress
I feel like Moses, I feel like I'm chosen
And if you ain't my nigga then your girl single to me
I don't give a damn if a nigga said he knew me
Grew up with no father so nobody ever "son" me
My flow too sick, Kevin Costner couldn't touch me
I know you wish that nobody ever love me
I feel useless when I'm never making money
Well, this the life we always fantasized
Rich folk problem through a Queen Street nigga's eyes
Every time you see me pulling up in Aventadors
Just know we been grinding on them sidewalks

[Hook: The Weeknd]
Sidewalks saved my life
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life
They showed me all the signs

[Post-Hook: Daniel Wilson]
They don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they lead me on

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Say, say, say
I come from murder one, brung late night melee
Say, say, say
We hung all summer, sprung mattress with bae bae
Say, say, say
Trippin' off Dyke, and my name strike with pay day
Say, say, say
Flippin' blue lightning, tightening, strapped with AK
Say, say, say
OG one, told me one, show me one, eight ways
How to segue
Pussy, power, profit and headache
I reminisce my life innocence or life innocent
Or life intimate, with fame
Light limo tint with light women, dark women in it
Awe Kenny, good game
She wanna hang with a Starboy
The sun and the moon and star, boy
Astronomer, anonymous
I line 'em up, we grind 'em up, there's nine of us
And five of us have probably fucked
She mollied up, I tallied up all the parts, boy
Twenty legs, arms, head (Head)
Head, head, and more head (Head)
Oh God, bless the dead (Yah)
I'm livin' life, high off life
I wear my chokes off to bed
I'm the greatest nigga, why you scared to say it?
I wanna rock, I wanna rock
I wanna cop more land, I never stop
I wanna quick advance on a bill if it ain't one
Break everything, I'm a hustler, came from

[Hook: The Weeknd]
Sidewalks saved my life
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life
They showed me all the signs

[Post-Hook: Daniel Wilson]
They don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they lead me on



[Instrumental break]

Uh-huh huh huh huh
Let me tell ya now
Uh-huh

[Verse 1]
When I had you to myself
I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you stand out in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch
One glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me to take a second look

[Chorus]
Oh baby give me one more chance
(show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me
(back in your heart)
Oh darlin' I was blind to let you go
(let you go baby)
But now since I see you in his arms
(I want you back)
Yes I do now
(I want you back)
Ooh ooh baby
(I want you back)
Ya ya ya ya
(I want you back)
Na na na na

[Verse 2]
Tryin' to live without your love
Is one long sleepless night
Let me show you girl
That I know wrong from right
Every street you walk on
I leave tear stains on the ground
Following the girl
I didn't even want around
Let me tell you now

[Chorus]
Oh baby all I need is one more chance
(show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me
(back to your heart)
Oh darlin' I was blind to let you go
(let you go baby)
But now since I see you in his arms

[Bridge]
Uh-huh
A buh buh buh buh
A buh buh buh buh
All I want
A buh buh buh buh
All I need
A buh buh buh buh
All I want
A buh buh buh buh
All I need

[Verse 3-Jeremine]
Oh just one more chance
To show you that I love you
Baby!
Baby!
Baby!
Baby!
Baby!
Baby!

(I want you back)

[Verse 4-Jackie]
Forget what happened then
(I want you back)
(Jermaine):
Let me live again

Oh baby I was blind to let you go
But now since I see you in his arms
(I want you back)
[Jackie]
Spare me of this cause
[Jermaine]
Gimme back what I lost

Oh baby I need one more chance ha
I tell ya that I love you



[Verse 1]
Oh, no
See you walking 'round like it's a funeral
Not so serious girl; why those feet cold?
We just getting started, don't you tiptoe, tiptoe

[Pre-Chorus]
Waste time with a masterpiece
Don't waste time with a masterpiece
You should be rolling with me
You should be rolling with me
You're a real-life fantasy
You're a real-life fantasy
But you're moving so carefully
Let's start living dangerously

[Chorus]
Talk to me, baby
I’m goin' blind from this sweet sweet craving, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
Ah ya ya ya ya I
Keep on hopin' we'll eat cake by the ocean
Walk for me, baby
I'll be Diddy, you'll be Naomi, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
Ah ya ya ya ya I
Keep on hopin' we'll eat cake by the ocean

[Verse 2]
Goddamn
See you licking frosting from your own hands
Want another taste, I'm begging, yes ma'am
I'm tired of all this candy on the dry land, dry land, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Waste time with a masterpiece
Don't waste time with a masterpiece
You should be rolling with me
You should be rolling with me, ah
You're a real-life fantasy
You're a real-life fantasy
But you're moving so carefully
Let's start living dangerously

[Chorus]
Talk to me, baby
I’m going blind from this sweet sweet craving, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
Ah ya ya ya ya I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
Walk for me, baby (walk for me now)

Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
Ah ya ya ya ya I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
Ah ya ya ya ya I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
Ah ya ya ya ya I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean

[Bridge]
You're fucking delicious
Talk to me, girl

[Chorus]
Talk to me, baby
I’m going blind from this sweet sweet craving, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
Ah ya ya ya ya I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
Walk for me, baby (walk for me now)

Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy

[Outro]
Red velvet, vanilla, chocolate in my life
Funfetti, I'm ready; I need it every night
Red velvet, vanilla, chocolate in my life
Ah ya ya ya ya I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean

If she catch me cheating, I will never tell her sorry
If she catch me cheating, I will never tell her sorry
Porsches in the valet, I got Bentleys, I got 'Raris
Taking pain pills on the plane, gettin' chartered
Poppin' tags on tags, I was starvin'

Turn a five star hotel to a traphouse
Roaches everywhere, like we forgot to take the trash out
Flood my cross with ice, gettin' money my religion
Got my baby momma and my side bitch kissin'
I turn the Ritz into a lean house
This the sixth time gettin' kicked out
I can't feel my face, I'm on Adderall, nauseous
Niggas tryna ride my fuckin' wave, now they salty
Runnin' with the wave, get you killed quick
Shoot you in your back like you Ricky

I'm reliving moments, peeling more residual

(I can) justify my love for you and touch the sky for God to stop, debating war
Put the pussy on a pedestal
Put the pussy on a high horse
That pussy to die for

So I could pick your brain and put your heart together
We depart the shady parts and party hard, the diamonds yours

[Verse 1]
Daylight
I wake up feeling like you won't play right
I used to know, but now that shit don't feel right
It made me put away my pride
So long
You made a nigga wait for some, so long
You make it hard for boy like that to go on
I'm wishing I could make this mine, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
If you want it, yeah
You can have it, oh, oh, oh
If you need it, ooh
We can make it, oh
If you want it
You can have it

[Chorus]
But stay woke
Niggas creepin'
They gon' find you
Gon' catch you sleepin' (ooh)
Now stay woke
Niggas creepin'
Now don't you close your eyes

[Verse 2]
Too late
You wanna make it right, but now it's too late
My peanut butter chocolate cake with Kool-Aid
I'm trying not to waste my time

[Pre-Chorus]
If you want it, oh
You can have it, you can have it
If you need it
You better believe in something
We can make it
If you want it
You can have it, ah!

[Chorus]
But stay woke (stay woke!)
Niggas creepin' (they be creepin')
They gon' find you (they gon' find you)
Gon' catch you sleepin' (Gon' catch you sleepin', put your hands up now baby)
Ooh, now stay woke
Niggas creepin'
Now, don't you close your eyes
But stay woke, ooh
Niggas creepin' (they gon' find you!)

[Verse 1]
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, "Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?"
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus 1]
People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts"
And mother always told me, "Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do, 'cause the lie becomes the truth"

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

[Verse 2]
For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand?
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (hoo)
She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby crying, his eyes were like mine (oh no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby

[Pre-Chorus 2]
People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts"
She came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
She says she is the one
She says I am the one

[Outro]
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover



[Intro: Sean Paul]
Call it love and devotion
Call it a mom's adoration, foundation
A special bond of creation, hah
For all the single moms out there
Going through frustration
Clean Bandit, Sean-da-Paul, Anne-Marie
Sing, make them hear

[Verse 1: Anne-Marie & Sean Paul]
She works at nights, by the water
She's gone astray, so far away
From her father's daughter
She just wants a life for her baby
All on her own, no one will come
She's got to save him (daily struggle)

[Pre-Chorus 1: Anne-Marie & Sean Paul]
She tells him, "Oh, love, no one's ever gonna hurt you, love."
"I'm gonna give you all of my love."
"Nobody matters like you."
(Stay up there, stay up there!)
She tells him, "Your life ain't gon' be nothing like my life." (Straight!)
"You're gonna grow and have a good life."
"I'm gonna do what I've got to do."
(Stay up there, stay up there!)

[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
So, rockabye, baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye, baby, don't you cry

Rockabye, baby, don't you cry
Ah, Rockabye, no

[Post-Chorus 1: Sean Paul & Anne-Marie]
Rockabye, rocka-rocka-rocka-bye
(Rockabye, yeah, yeah)
Rockabye, rocka-rocka-rocka-bye

[Verse 2: Sean Paul & Anne-Marie]
Single mum, how're you doing out there?
Facing the hard life, without no fear (Yeah!)
Just so you know that you really care
'Cause any obstacle come, you're well prepared (Oh, no!)
And no, mama, you never shed tear
'Cause you have to shed things year after year
And you give the yout love beyond compare (Yeah!)
You find his school fee and the bus fare (Yeah!)
Mh, Marie, the paps' disappear
In the wrong bar, can't find him nowhere
Steadily your workflow, heavily you know
So your non-stop, no time, no time for ya dear

[Bridge: Anne-Marie]
Now she got a six-year-old
Trying to keep him warm
Trying to keep out the cold
When he looks in her eyes
He don't know he is safe

[Pre-Chorus 2: Anne-Marie]
When she says, "Oh, love, no one's ever gonna hurt you, love."
"I'm gonna give you all of my love."
"Nobody matters like you."

[Chorus: Anne-Marie & Sean Paul]
So, rockabye, baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye, baby, don't you cry
Somebody's got you
Rockabye, baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye, baby, don't you cry
(Badda-bang-bang-bang, alright then)
Ah, Rockabye, no

[Post-Chorus 2: Sean Paul & Anne-Marie]
Rockabye, rocka-rocka-rocka-bye
(Rockabye, yeah, yeah)
Rockabye, rocka-rocka-rocka-bye
Rockabye, don't bother cry
Lift up your head, lift it up to the sky, yo
Rockabye, don't bother cry
Angels surround you, just dry your eye

[Bridge: Anne-Marie]
Now she got a six-year-old
Trying to keep him warm
Trying to keep out the cold
When he looks in her eyes
He don't know he is safe when she says

[Pre-Chorus 1: Anne-Marie & Sean Paul]
She tells him, "Oh, love, no one's ever gonna hurt you, love."
"I'm gonna give you all of my love."
"Nobody matters like you."
(Stay up there, stay up there!)
She tells him, "Your life ain't gon' be nothing like my life." (Straight!)
"You're gonna grow and have a good life."
"I'm gonna do what I got to do.", yeah

[Chorus: Anne-Marie & Sean Paul]
So, rockabye, baby, rockabye
(Rockabye, rocka-rocka-rocka-bye)
I'm gonna rock you

[Post-Chorus 3: Sean Paul & Anne-Marie]
Rockabye, don't bother cry
Lift up your head, lift it up to the sky (Ah, Rockabye!)
Rockabye, don't bother cry (Yeah!)
Angels surround you, just dry your eye (Yeah, ah, rockabye!)
Rockabye, don't bother cry (No!)
Lift up your head, lift it up to the sky (Oh, Rockabye!)
Rockabye, don't bother cry
Angels surround you, just dry your eye



[Intro]
Awwwww...haha

[Verse 1]
Now I was barely seventeen with a pocket full of hope
Screamin' "dollar and a dream" with my closet lookin' broke
And my nigga's lookin' clean, gettin' caught up with that dope
Have you ever served a fiend with a pocket full of soap?
Nigga I can tell you things that you probably shouldn't know
Have you ever heard the screams when the body hit the floor?
Flashbacks to the pain, wakin' up, cold sweats
Six o'clock in the mornin', gotta hit the BowFlex
Get my weight up on the block, keep watch for the cops
God they love to serve a nigga three hots and a cot
Nowadays crime pays like a part time job
And the drought got me prayin' for a Carl Thom vibe
Summer Rain come again
Numb the pain 'cause it's hard for a felon
In my mind I been cryin', know it's wrong but I'm sellin'
Eyes wellin' up with tears
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas dead in the dirt
Immortalized on this shirt

[Hook]
Real niggas don't die
Forward with the plot
One-Seven-Forty-Five
Form at the plot
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't lie
Form in the plot
My niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Real niggas don't die

[Verse 2]
Have you ever seen a fiend cook crack on the spoon?
Have you ever seen a nigga that was black on the moon?
Have you ever seen your brother go to prison as you cry?
Have you ever seen a motherfuckin' ribbon in the sky?
Nope, all I see is that C.R.E.A.M nigga, that green
I'm a black king, black jeans on my black queen
And her ass fat, too fat for a flat screen
I'm the type of nigga make the whole fuckin' trap lean
Kingpin nigga, put wings on a crack fiend
If they want a nigga, they gon' have to send a SWAT team
And I'm goin' out like Scarface in his last scene
A legend, what that mean—?

[Hook]
Real niggas don't die
Forward with the plot
One-Seven-Forty-Five
Form at the plot
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Hood niggas don't lie
Form in the plot
My niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Real niggas don't die

[Outro]
To die a young legend or live a long life unfulfilled
'Cause you wanna change the world
But while alive you never will
'Cause they only feel you after you gone, or I've been told
And now I'm caught between bein' heard and gettin' old
Damn, death creepin' in my thoughts lately
My one wish in this bitch, "Make it quick if the Lord take me"
I know nobody meant to live forever anyway
And so I hustle like my niggas in Virgini-A
They tellin' niggas, "sell dope, rap or go to NBA," (in that order)
It's that sort of thinkin' that been keepin' niggas chained
At the bottom and hanged
The strangest fruit that you ever seen
Ripe with pain, listen...



[Verse 1]
[Marvin Gaye]
Listen, baby
Ain't no mountain high
Ain't no vally low
Ain't no river wide enough, baby

[Tammi Terrell]
If you need me, call me
No matter where you are
No matter how far (don't worry, baby)
Just call my name
I'll be there in a hurry
You don't have to worry
Cause baby there

[Hook: Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell]
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you

[Verse 2: Marvin Gaye]
Remember the day
I set you free
I told you you could always count on me, darling
From that day on, I made a vow
I'll be there when you want me
Someway, somehow
Cause baby there

[Hook: Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell]

[Bridge]
[Marvin Gaye]
Oh no, darling

[Tammi Terrell]
No wind, no rain
Nor winter storm
Can't stop me baby

[Marvin Gaye]
No no baby

[Tammi Terrell]
Cause you are my goal

[Marvin Gaye]
If you're ever in trouble
I'll be there on the double
Just send for me

[Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell]
M&T: Oh baby!

[Verse 3]
My love is alive
Way down in my heart
Although we are miles apart

[Marvin Gaye]
If you ever need a helping hand
I'll be there on the double
Just as fast as I can

[Both]
Don't you know that there...
[Hook]



[Chorus]
Yah, it do not matter
Turned to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smokin' that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster
Turned to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smokin' that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster

[Verse 1]
Money so old, dollars spoiled
Yah, my lil bitch so spoiled
Yah, I rub her down in oil
Yah, I got money, now you know it
Yah, diamonds on my teeth
Yah, your shit look like foil
Yah, Chris Brown said these hoes ain't loyal
None of these hoes got no morals
All my niggas G'ed up
Yah, my glasses be Dita
Never thought it would be days I could kick my feet up
Never thought that she would need me that much if I leave her

[Chorus]
It do not matter
Turned to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smokin' that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster
Turned to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smokin' that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster
Turned to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smokin' that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster

[Verse 2]
All of this was faction
No time for actin', all this money lastin'
Like, go out to eat, get that blackened salmon
When I'm wit' my girl, we Pharrell and Vashtie
Wait... huh? That mean we are not lastin'
In that pussy, you know I like it rough then I'm just blastin'
Yah, tell that lil bitch that I'm really from Mars
Uh, yah, bitch, do not start
Yah, pull up, my car automatic
Yah, uh, dealt with the star, yah!

[Chorus]
It do not matter
Turned to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smokin' that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster
Turned to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smokin' that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster

[Intro]
First things first: rest in peace Uncle Phil
For real, you the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant, I'ma be a better you
Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville, fulfilled
Listen, even back when we was broke, my team ill
Martin Luther King woulda been on Dreamville
Talk to a nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Verse 1]
No role models and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed
By the baddest bitch, not Trina but I swear to God
This bitch'll make you call your girl up
And tell her, "Hey, what's good?"
"Sorry I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good."
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, "Nah, I was the same without it."
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
Before I started callin' bitches "bitches" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
You wasn't sweatin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Verse 2]
I want a real love, dark skinned Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga, I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do'
Nigga, you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt 'fore she leave
I'ma need my shirt back (nigga, you know how it go)

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Interlude: George W. Bush]
There's an old saying in Tennessee—I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee—that says, fool me once… shame on… shame on you. Fool me, you can't get fooled again.

[Bridge]
Fool me one time, shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you
Fool me one time, shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you

[Verse 3]
My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script, the bitch probably couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret, could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

Well, then tell me who deserve it
Eyes getting low but I'm still observing, I see you lurking
Never see me out in person, I'm always working
Money on your head if you make a nigga nervous
Never made a move out here unless I was certain
Tatted on me, but this shit is deeper than the surface
I'm with everyone that I was here with in the first place
Making sure that they all good before they close the curtain

Letra de "Chantaje" ft. Maluma[Translation]

[Verso 1: Maluma]
Cuando estás bien te alejas de mí
Te sientes sola y siempre estoy ahí
Es una guerra de toma y dame
Pues dame de eso que tienes ahí
Oye baby, no seas mala
No me dejes con las ganas
Se escucha en la calle
Que ya no me quieres
Ven y dímelo en la cara

[Pre-Coro: Shakira, Maluma]
Pregúntale a quien tú quieras
Vida, te juro que eso no es así
Yo nunca tuve una mala intención
Yo nunca quise burlarme de ti
Conmigo ves, nunca se sabe
Un día digo que no y otro que sí
Yo soy masoquista
Con mi cuerpo un egoísta

[Coro: Ambos, Shakira, Maluma]
Tú eres puro, puro chantaje
Puro, puro chantaje
Siempre es a tu manera
Yo te quiero aunque no quiera
Tú eres puro, puro chantaje
Puro, puro chantaje
Vas libre como el aire
No soy de ti ni de nadie

[Verso 2: Maluma, Shakira]
Como tú me tientas, cuando tú te mueves
Esos movimientos sexys, siempre me entretienen
Sabes manipularme bien con tus caderas
No sé porque me tienes en lista de espera

Te dicen por ahí que voy haciendo y deshaciendo
Que salgo cada noche, que te tengo ahí sufriendo
Que en esta relación soy yo la que manda
No pares bola' a toda esa mala propaganda

[Puente: Maluma, Shakira]
Pa', pa' que te digo na', te comen el oído
No vaya a enderezar lo que no se ha torcido
Y como un loco sigo tras de ti, muriendo por ti
Dime qué hay pa' mí, bebé (¿Qué?)

[Pre-Coro: Maluma, Shakira]
Pregúntale a quien tú quieras
Vida, te juro que eso no es así
Yo nunca tuve una mala intención
Yo nunca quise burlarme de ti
Conmigo ves, nunca se sabe
Un día digo que no, y otro que sí
Yo soy masoquista
Con mi cuerpo un egoísta

[Coro: Ambos, Maluma, Shakira]
Tú eres puro, puro chantaje
Puro, puro chantaje
Siempre es a tu manera
Yo te quiero aunque no quiera
Tú eres puro, puro chantaje
Puro, puro chantaje
Vas libre como el aire
No soy de ti ni de nadie

[Post-Coro: Ambos, Shakira]
Eh-eh-eh, nadie
Eh-eh-eh, nadie
Eh-eh-eh, nadie
Con mi cuerpo, un egoísta

[Coro: Ambos, Maluma, Shakira]
Tú eres puro, puro chantaje
Puro, puro chantaje
Siempre es a tu manera
Yo te quiero aunque no quiera
Tú eres puro, puro chantaje
Puro, puro chantaje
Vas libre como el aire
No soy de ti ni de nadie

[Post-Coro: Ambos, Shakira]
Eh-eh-eh, nadie
Eh-eh-eh, nadie
Eh-eh-eh, nadie
Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh

[Outro: Maluma, Shakira]
(Alright alright baby, Shakira, Maluma) Pretty boy
(You're my baby loba, Colombia, You feel me?) Pretty boy



[Verse 1: Marc E. Bassy]
Wake up this morning I'm shaking I can't be still girl
Too many images running through my mind
Soon as I hit it, I can't get it out my system
Even my brother he asked me what you on

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
I'm on some kind of drug
Can't explain all the ways you get me high

Fire be burning in my hotel room
Come through, champagne be poppin'
System be knockin' in my hotel room

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Ever since I met you, you got me changing my schedule
If you ain't know, that shit's eventful
And losing this money is dreadful, but
Believe me, that pussy is special
You wanna meet moms, I might let you
Rollie is so presidential
Keep it on while we fuck that's 'cause I meant to, yeah
Fuck you twice, we take a nap, soon as you're awake, get back
Go for three it takes a nack
I'm taking you to places that
You ain't been girl, face the fact, meant it, I can't take it back
Whisky straight, ain't chasing that, I'll taste the cat, yeah
(taste the cat)
Yeah, you told me I own that pearl
Yeah, that's 'cause I bone you thorough
You should be my only girl
When I hit it, you feel like you own the world

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
I'm on some kind of drug
Can't explain all the ways you get me high

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Since the last time we had sex
Honestly, I've been a mess, well
Feenin' 'cause you got the best
Borderline kind of obsessed and yeah
I'm on some kind of drug
I've been addicted and I cannot find enough
I call you, I'm tryna fuck, I'm in room 921, come on up
And we could put up the "please do not disturb"
I got drink, I got the herb, I'm tweakin', now I must be cured
The only way I rest assured is if
I get my fix
I love the way your dress just slips
Right off your waist, right down your hips
Technique's the best, she knows some tricks and yeah
I need you now, I need you bad
You and me both of us been feenin' bad
I guess what I really mean is that—well, yeah

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
I'm on some kind of drug
Can't explain all the ways you get me high

[Verse 1]
I took a pill in Ibiza
To show Avicii I was cool
And when I finally got sober, felt 10 years older
But fuck it, it was something to do
I'm living out in LA
I drive a sports car just to prove
I'm a real big baller cause I made a million dollars
And I spend it on girls and shoes

[Chorus]
But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs

I-I know are sad songs
I-I know are sad songs
I-I know are sad songs
I-I know are sad songs

[Verse 2]
I'm just a singer who already blew his shot
I get along with old timers
Cause my name's a reminder of a pop song people forgot
And I can't keep a girl, no
Cause as soon as the sun comes up
I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse
But the truth is I can't open up

[Chorus]
But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs

I-I know are sad songs
I-I know are sad songs
Sad songs
I-I know are sad songs
Sad songs
I-I know are sad songs



[Verse 1]
Record man play my song on the radio
You too busy tryna find that blue-eyed soul
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I swear too much on the regular
We gone let them hits fly, we gone let it go
If it ain't XO then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talking 'bout a face numbing off a bag of blow
I'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate
All my niggas blew up like a propane
All these R&B niggas be so lame
Got a sweet Asian chick, she go Lo Mein

[Chorus]
You know me, you know man, you know me
Every time you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me (pow! pow!), you know me

[Verse 2]
Said I'm just tryna swim in something wetter than the ocean
Faded off a double cup, I'm mixing up the potion
All I wanna do is make that money and make dope shit
It just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit
Everybody knows it, all these niggas know me
Platinum off a mixtape, sipping on that codeine
Pour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed
I'ma keep on singing while I'm burning up that OG
All my niggas get it they make money all alone
Rock a chain around they neck, making sure I'm getting home
When I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil' a show
And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know
Used to walk around with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor
Now my shit straight
Eating all day, tryna lose weight
That good sex, we'll sweat it out
Hotel bed springs, we'll wear it out
I ain't gotta tell you 'cause

[Chorus]
You know me, you know me
You know man, you know me
Every time you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me (pow! pow!), you know me

[Bridge]
Why don't you shake some, shake somethin'
For the Don? Don't you break nothin', break nothin'
Baby girl, won't you work some, work somethin'
For the Don? Don't you hurt nothin', hurt nothin'
Big girl, won't you shake some, shake somethin'
For the Don? Don't you break nothin', break nothin'
Baby girl, won't you work some, work somethin'
For the Don? don't you hurt nothin', hurt nothin'

[Outro]
'Cause you know me, they know me
You ain't know me, yet you know me



[Verse 1]
I was the knight in shining armor in your movie
Would put your lips on mine and love the aftertaste
Now I'm a ghost, I call your name, you look right through me
You're the reason I'm alone and masturbate

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I've been trying to fix my pride
But that shit's broken, that shit's broken
Lie, lie, l-lie I tried to hide
But now you know it

[Chorus]
That I'm at an all time
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

[Verse 2]
I was the prototype like 3 Stacks on that CD
An example of the perfect candidate
Now all your girlfriends say that you don't want to see me
You're the reason that I just can't concentrate

[Pre-Chorus]
I, (I, I) I've been trying to fix my pride
But that shit's broken, that shit's broken
Lie (lie, lie), lie, l-lie I tried to hide
But now you know it

[Chorus]
That I'm at an all time
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

[Bridge]
I, I, I, I've been trying to fix my pride
But that shit's broken, that shit's broken
Lie (lie, lie), lie, l-lie and try to hide
But now you know it
That I'm at an all time
Low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Lie, l-lie, I try to hide, but now you know it

Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

[Verse 1]
I fly like paper, get high like planes
If you catch me at the border I got visas in my name
If you come around here, I make 'em all day
I get one done in a second if you wait
I fly like paper, get high like planes
If you catch me at the border I got visas in my name
If you come around here, I make 'em all day
I get one done in a second if you wait
Sometimes I think sittin' on trains
Every stop I get to I'm clocking that game
Everyone's a winner, we're making our fame
Bona fide hustler making my name
Sometimes I think sittin' on trains
Every stop I get to I'm clocking that game
Everyone's a winner, we're making our fame
Bona fide hustler making my name

[Chorus]

Pirate skulls and bones
Sticks and stones and weed and bongs
Running when we hit 'em
Lethal poison for the system
Pirate skulls and bones
Sticks and stones and weed and bongs
Running when we hit 'em
Lethal poison for the system
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Hit me on my burner prepaid wireless
We pack and deliver like UPS trucks
Already going to hell, just pumping that gas
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Hit me on my burner prepaid wireless
We pack and deliver like UPS trucks
Already going to hell, just pumping that gas

[Chorus]

You shout it out, but I can't hear a word you say
I'm talking loud, not saying much
I'm criticized, but all your bullets ricochet
You shoot me down, but I get up

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away

You shoot me down, but I won't fall

You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium

Ghost town and haunted love
Raise your voice, sticks and stones may break my bones
I'm talking loud, not saying much

I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away

Stone hard, machine gun
Fired at the ones who run
Stone hard, as bulletproof glass

I am titanium
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium

Fuck practice, this shit just happens, know y'all can't stand it

[Hook: PnB Rock]
I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won’t get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won’t get back
Yeah I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don’t think about the times
I wish that I could rewind

[Hook: PnB Rock]
‘Cause I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won’t get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won’t get back
Yeah I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don’t think about the times
I wish that I could rewind

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
I told my mama we gon’ be fine
So I’m up all night way after sleep time
I’m just thinkin’ ‘bout Lil Kuda
Gave my dog a dime
He put a buckshot in a nigga’s behind
No daddy so I grew up to the street life
But my son, I’ma keep him in the beehive
Scheming on a heist, I need to change my life
Been geekin’ all night, I’m going senile
With two niggas toting three 4-5’s
I seen a nigga play gangsta, then he broke down
Lost a lot, lost his mind in the courthouse
I’m on XXL, I’m in New York now

[Hook: PnB Rock]
‘Cause I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won’t get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won’t get back
Yeah I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don’t think about the times
I wish that I could rewind

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
I keep thinkin’ ‘bout my niggas
I think I need a jigga
I would keep on falling victim
Lost up in the system
Miss my brothers and my sisters
Damn I miss my lil one
I know sometimes I be tripping
But I just miss my niggas
I got codeine in my liver
I gave the judge a piece of me
I’m too street for the industry
But I think that’s where I need to be
‘Cause verbally, mentally, and physically I keep that heat
Me and my brother fit in
We smoking one with PnB
Niggas say they fuck with me
But lowkey they be easin' me
Bitches don’t mean shit to me
People tryna sentence me
How a youngin’ posted on the street, gon’ call it Sesame
1K ‘til the death of me, don’t put your life in jeopardy

[Hook: PnB Rock]
I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won’t get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won’t get back
Yeah I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don’t think about the times
I wish that I could rewind



[Verse 1]
And you got me like, "Oh, what you want from me?"
(What you want from me?)
And I tried to buy your pretty heart, but the price too high
Baby you got me like "Oh"
You love when I fall apart (fall apart)
So you can put me together and throw me against the wall

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby you got me like i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-hiii, woo i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-hiii
Don't you stop loving me (loving me)
Don't quit loving me (loving me)
Just start loving me (loving me)
Owwwwww

[Chorus]
And babe I’m fist-fighting with fire
Just to get close to you
Can we burn something babe
And I run for miles just to get a taste
Must be love on the brain
That’s got me feeling this way
It beats me black and blue but it fucks me so good
And I can’t get enough
Must be love on the brain yeah
And it keeps cursing my name
No matter what I do
I’m no good without you
And I can’t get enough
Must be love on the..... brain

[Verse 2]
Baby keep loving me
Just love me
Yeah, just love me
All you need to do is love me, yeah
Got me like, ah-ha-ha-owww
I’m tired of being played like a violin
What do I gotta do to get in your motherfuckin’ heart?
Baby like i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-hiii, woo i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-hiii

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby you got me like i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-hiii, woo i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-hiii
Don't you stop loving me (loving me)
Don't quit loving me (loving me)
Just start loving me (loving me)
Ooooooohhh

[Chorus]
And babe I’m fist-fighting with fire
Just to get close to you

And I run for miles just to get a taste
Must be love on the brain

It beats me black and blue but it fucks me so good
And I can’t get enough
Must be love on the brain yeah
And it keeps cursing my name
No matter what I do
I’m no good without you
And I can’t get enough
Must be love on the.... brain

[Intro]
My intuition is telling me there'll be better days, yeah
My intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I like this tone

[Verse 1]
Yeah, my intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I sit in silence and find whenever I meditate
My fears alleviate, my tears evaporate
My faith don't deviate, ideas don't have a date
But see I'm growing and getting stronger with every breath
Bringing me closer to Heaven's doors with every step
As we speak I'm at peace, no longer scared to die
Most niggas don't believe in God and so they terrified
It's either that or they be fearing they gon' go to Hell
Asking the Father for forgiveness, got 'em overwhelmed (Please, God, I want to go to Heaven)
As if He's spiteful like them white folks that control the jail
See I believe if God is real, He'd never judge a man
Because He knows us all and therefore He would understand
The ignorance that make a nigga take his brother life
The bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife

[Hook]
I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from—
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from—

[Verse 2]
Yeah, my chosen religion
Jesus piece frozen from sinnin'
Doin' dirt, hoping to God, He know my intentions
To see a million 'fore I see a casket
I got a baby on the way, know he gon' be a bastard
I'm living fast like I'm in a drag race, how that cash taste
When I was a senior, I was ballin' on my classmates
Niggas put three bullets in my car, one hit the gas tank
Know I got a angel cause I'm supposed to have a halo
Right now, my lifestyle destined for a federal facility
For my ability to make them birds fly
Fiends wanna get higher than a bird's eye view
And who am I to tell a nigga what to do?
I just supply, it's economics
My business ain't got the suit and tie
Keep a pistol at all times, niggas want what's mine
I can't oblige, dog, I work too hard
So reach for it, get referred to God, I'm going hard, nigga

[Hook]
I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from—
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from—

[Verse 3]
Yeah, prodigal son, got a new gun
This one don't run out of ammo
Lately been working on my handles
Can I ball, become a star and remain my self?
If I fall, dust it off and regain my self
Fuck 'em all, they don't know all the pain I felt
I'm in awe, after all the fame I felt, I evolved
I no longer bury demons, I be a vessel for the truth until I'm barely breathing, I'm singing

[Bridge: Ari Lennox & J. Cole]
Life is all about the evolution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
You can dream but don't neglect the execution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Time is short that's what somebody told me
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Too short to keep following your homies
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more

[Bridge]
I reminisce back to a time where niggas threw they hands
All of a sudden niggas pop a trunk and then we scram
Finger on trigger make a little nigga understand
What it's like to finally be the motherfuckin' man
Eyes wide that's from the power that the coward feels
Niggas die over bitches, disrespect, and dollar bills
Bloodshed that turned the city to a battlefield
I call it poison, you call it real (pop, pop, pop, pop)
That's how you feel?

[Verse 4]
Pistols be poppin' and niggas drop in a heartbeat
Scattered like roaches, a body laid on the concrete
A body laid on the concrete
Look, somebody laid on the concrete
No time for that, ain't no lookin' back, cause I'm running too
I made it home, I woke up and turned on the morning news
Overcame with a feeling I can't explain
Cause that was my nigga James that was slain, he was 22
(Last night at around...) He was 22
(22 year old black male, suspect, reporting live...)

[Outro]
(I swear to God bruh)
We're gathered here today...
(I swear to God)
To mourn the life of James McMillan Jr
(I swear to God—nigga, I'mma kill them niggas man)
A tragedy, another tragedy in the black community
(I promise you bro...)
We got to do better, people
22 years old, this boy was too young
(I promise you bro, I'mma kill them niggas yo...)
Our condolences go to his family, our prayers
(I'mma kill them niggas myself...)
We know he's in a better place
We know he's in a better place
But this has got to end, ladies and gentleman
We've got to come together, this is—this is beyond words
Now I'd like to open this ceremony with a verse fro—



[Verse 1]
Don't, don't play with her, don't be dishonest (ayy)
Still not understandin' this logic (ayy)
I'm back and I'm better (and I'm better)
I want you bad as ever
Don't let me just let up
I wanna give you better
Baby, it's whatever
Somebody gotta step up
Girl, I'm that somebody, so I'm next up
Be damned if I let him catch up
It's easy to see that you're fed up
I am on a whole 'nother level
Girl, he only fucked you over cause you let him
Fuck him, girl, I guess he didn't know any better
Girl, that man didn't show any effort
Do all I can just to show you you're special
Certain it's your love that holds me together
Lately you say he been killin' the vibe
Gotta be sick of this guy
Pull up, skrr, get in the ride
Left hand is steerin' the other is grippin' your thigh
Light up a spliff and get high
Shawty, you deserve what you've been missin'
Lookin' at you I'm thinkin' he must be trippin'
Play this song for him, tell him, "Just listen"

[Hook]
Don't
Don't

[Verse 2]
Girl, said he keeps on playin' games
And his lovin' ain't the same
I don't know what to say, but
What a shame
If you were mine you would not get the same
If you were mine you would top everything
Suicide in the drop switchin' lanes
And that thing so fire, baby, no propane
Got good pussy, girl, can I be frank?
To keep it one-hundred, girl, I ain't no saint
But he the only reason that I'm feelin' this way
Givin' you the world, baby, when you get space
Pen game get me laid, baby, that's penetrate
Oh baby

[Hook]
Don't

[Verse 3: King Vory]
H-Town got a nigga so throwed
Pour up, we can party some more
Yeah, got this drank in my cup
Got a young nigga feelin' so throwed
Spit fire in a world so cold
Young money got a nigga feelin' old
Spit fire in a world so cold
H-Town got me feelin' so throwed
H-Town got me feelin' so throwed
Ride paint and we sip 'til we fold
H-Town got me feelin' so throwed
Spit fire in a world so cold
H-Town got a nigga so throwed

[Hook]
Don't

[Verse 1: Kai]
What I would do to take away this fear of being loved
Allegiance to the pain
Now I'm fucked up and I'm missing you
He'll never be like you
I would give anything to change this fickle-minded heart
That loves fake shiny things
Now I'm fucked up and I'm missing you
He'll never be like you

[Hook: Kai]
I'm only human, can't you see? I made, I made a mistake
Please just look me in my face, tell me everything's okay
'Cause I got it, he'll never be like you
I'm only human, can't you see? I made, I made a mistake
Please just look me in my face, tell me everything's okay
'Cause I got it, he'll never be like you

[Verse 2: Kai]
How do I make you wanna stay?
Hate sleeping on my own, missing the way you taste
Now I'm fucked up and I'm missing you
He'll never be like you
Stop looking at me with those eyes
Like I could disappear and you wouldn't care why
Now I'm fucked up and I'm missing you
He'll never be like you

[Hook: Kai]
I'm only human, can't you see? I made, I made a mistake
Please just look me in my face, tell me everything's okay
'Cause I got it, he'll never be like you
I'm only human, can't you see? I made, I made a mistake
Please just look me in my face, tell me everything's okay

Baby, baby, please believe me
C'mon, take it easy
Please don't ever leave me
He'll never be like you



[Verse 1: Mark Morrison]
Well, I tried to tell you so (yes, I did)
But I guess you didn't know
As the saddest story goes
Baby, now I got the flo'
Cause I knew it from the start
Baby, when you broke my heart
That I had to come again
And to show you that I'm with

[Pre-Hook: Mark Morrison & Fetty Wap]
You lied to me
All those times I said that I loved you
You lied to me
Oh my god baby
Dare I ask

[Hook: Mark Morrison & Fetty Wap]
Return of the Mack, once again
Return of the Mack, top of the world
Return of the Mack, watch my flow
You know that I'll be back
Return of the Mack

[Verse 2: Mark Morrison]
So, I'm back up in the game (hustling sound)
Running things to keep my swing (whole night long)
Letting all the people know
That I'm back to run the show
Cause what you did you know was wrong
And all the nasty things you've done (oh oh oh)
So baby listen carefully while I sing my comeback song
Squah!

[Pre-Hook: Mark Morrison & Fetty Wap]
You lied to me
All those times I said that I loved you
You lied to me
Oh my god baby
Dare I ask
You lied to me, all this pain you said I'd never feel
You lied to me, but I do, but I do, do, do

[Hook: Mark Morrison]
Return of the Mack, there it is
Return of the Mack, come on
Return of the Mack, oh my God
You know that I'll be back, here I am
Return of the Mack, once again
Return of the Mack, top of the world
Return of the Mack, watch my flow
You know that I'll be back, here I go

[Verse 3: Fetty Wap]
Cause the money ain't enough
I remember when it was
I had dreams of being up
I ain't never leave you stuck (oh my god)
And you say you will never turn on me, baby, aye
You played me like a tournament, baby, aye
You know I gave you the best of me, baby
Oh man, I thought you were next to me, baby
I guess I gotta show you I am the one that you were with
That got you swerving in the whip
And putting diamonds on your wrists, baby
Still making hit after hit, baby
I bet you'll let me hit after this

[Pre-Hook: Mark Morrison]
You lied to me, all this pain you said I'd never feel
You lied to me, but I do, but I do, do, do

[Hook: Mark Morrison]
Return of the Mack, yea
Return of the Mack, come on
Return of the Mack, oh my God
You know that I'll be back, here I am
Return of the Mack, once again
Return of the Mack, top of the world
Return of the Mack, watch my flow
You know that I'll be back, here I go

Check

[Verse 2]
We used to lay up and then stay up
Have sex and then blow dank
I shouldn't have played no games with you, just leveled-up my rank
Last time I saw you we ain't speak, that was strange
Guess it's nothing I can do, man, it's true, exes change, yeah
Aye, guess you changed for the better (better!)
I know you know how to make me jealous
I was never loyal, let you tell it, yo
But I'm ready to fix it if you ready, baby
But so, so (Yeah)

[Hook]
So give me all of you in exchange for me
Just give me all of you in exchange for me, for me

[Break 2]
For real shawty
You already know

[Verse 3]
Yeah, is you at Two Keys or Tin Roof?
Turn up with young Tiller, we just gettin' loose
Maybe I'm lowkey feelin' you, don't be cynical
Won’t fuck you over, wanna fuck you over and again
The truth is I ain't really here to start problems
Girl, I swear to God them hoes can't never say they got him
Know how bad you wanna tell 'em, "don't try him"
I don't wanna tell 'em, let's surprise 'em
I don't wanna get into it – why you stressin' him? I've been drivin'
Back and forth, from Louisville to Lexington, mileage
On the whip, got your ass in my grip
College make you wanna strip for them dollars
Nah girl, I got a job for you, swear to God I can do a lot for you
Saw you strollin' through the campus, I had to stop for you
I was scrollin' through the 'gram, girl, I had to follow you
Say what's up with you?
You got my soul

[Verse 1]
I'm findin' ways to articulate the feeling I'm goin' through
I just can't say I don't love you
'Cause I love you, yeah
It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold
But tonight I'm gon' let you know
Let me tell the truth
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You know what I'm thinkin'
See it in your eyes
You hate that you want me
Hate it when you cry
You're scared to be lonely
'Specially in the night
I'm scared that I'll miss you
Happens every time
I don't want this feelin'
I can't afford love
I try to find a reason to pull us apart
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect
And I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh!

[Chorus]
Even though we're going through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you

It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby
I would die for you
Baby I would die for you, yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm finding ways to manipulate the feelin' you're goin' through
But baby girl, I'm not blamin' you
Just don't blame me too, yeah

And you won't find no one that's better
'Cause I'm right for you, babe
I think I'm right for you, babe

[Pre-Chorus]
You know what I'm thinkin'
See it in your eyes
You hate that you want me

Baby I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby
I would die for you
Baby I would die for you, yeah

[Bridge]
I would die for you
I would lie for you
Keep it real with you
I would kill for you, my baby
I'm just sayin', yeah
I would die for you
I would lie for you
Keep it real with you
I would kill for you, my baby
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na

[Chorus]
Even though we're going through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby
I would die for you
Baby I would die for you, yeah babe
(Die for you)

[Verse 1]
"No thank you" is what I should've said
I should be in bed
But temptations of trouble on my tongue
Troubles yet to come

[Pre-Chorus]
One sip, bad for me
One hit, bad for me
One kiss, bad for me
But I give in so easily
And no thank you is how it should've gone
I should stay strong

[Chorus]
But I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak

(Ooh waaaaaaa ee ya ee ya)
(Ooh waaaaaaa ee ya ee ya)
But I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
(Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that)

[Verse 2]
No thank you
They call me after dark, I don't want no part
My habits, they hold me like a grudge
I promise I won't budge

[Pre-Chorus]
One sip, bad for me
One hit, bad for me
One kiss, bad for me
But I give in so easily
And no thank you is how it should've gone
I should stay strong

[Chorus]
But I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Doesn't make sense now
Shit just got real, things are gettin' intense now
I hear you talkin' 'bout "we" a lot, oh, you speak French now?
Giving me the signs so I gotta take a hint now
I hit you up like "Do you wanna hang right now?"
On the East Side and you know I'm with the gang right now
You say do I own a watch, do I know what time it is right now
It's after 2AM and that's askin' a lot of you right now

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
All she talkin' bout is, "Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"
All she ever say is, "Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"

[Verse 2: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I been up for two whole days thinkin' what I did to keep you goin'
Thumbin' through the voicemails that you left me tellin' me where I went wrong
I'll admit I'm sorry when I feel I'm truly sorry
Things change, people change, feelings change too
Never thought the circumstances woulda changed you
You said you never traded no
Yeah you said that
And I believed you when they told me don't
Yeah thought you meant that
But either way you're still invited and I can't even lie to you

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR + Drake]
Swear these days all you say is, "Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"
All she hit me with is, "Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"

[Verse 3: Drake]
Why you gotta start, girl, why you gotta start?
I know we make time for the things that we want
I know you got another nigga tryna play the part
Just 'cause he got a heart don't mean he got heart
Could be standin' in a field, and he still ain't in the field
If anything should change then I thought we had a deal
Lately you keep questionin' what you get out the deal
Doin' things to make me feel the way I make you feel
How hard is it to let you know when I'm comin' home?
That way you can be prepared
Maybe take a couple sick days and not miss pay
I don't even know what things are looking like inside of your place
Or how it's decorated
This thing is gettin' one-sided, I can't even lie to you right now
Yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
All she talkin' bout is, "Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"
All she hit me with is, "Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"

[Intro]
I got so sad
KKK, KKK

[Verse]
Young nigga, I got old cash, spazzin' on they ass
I got Prada on my hoe ass, got my last one mad
Pop a nigga like a damn tag, shoppin' on they ass
I just bought a new old Jag, yeah, it's so fast
Smokin' flocka, you a jackass, all I smoke is gas
Don't you ask me where the pole at, where your clothes at?
I ain't talking 'bout my niggas, dammit, but y'all tripping, too
Is it you? Damn, my nigga, what the hell got into you?
Project Baby, y'all was skipping in the hallway, I was skipping school
On my Ps and Qs,  on them jiggas, call me jiggaboo
Bleeding concrete, bet you niggas won't come cross the street
Pardon me, I don't talk to you, so don't you talk to me
I ain't dissing on nobody B, I'm vibing on the beat
Honestly, I'm just trying to be, I just gotta be
Trying to get over on anything, they telling lies to me
I spent five on my pinky ring, she love my diamond ring
Anyway, I'm married to the game, she said her vows to me
I ain't getting on my knees, bae, you bow down to me
You go down for me, you lay down and do the time for me
Sorry, boo, yeah, I lie to you, but don't you lie to me
It's little Kodak, the finesse kid, boy who hot as me?
Told the doctor I'm a healthy kid, I smoke broccoli
I will run around your whole board like Monopoly
Ol' boy, you's a broke boy, flocka's got you beat
Chocolate, call me Reese's, can't catch me without the piece
C'est la vie, I'm ten toes down, you falling off your feet
I will trick your ass for a treat, call it Halloween
Yeah, that money's what I play for, call it lottery
Goddamn, you's a clown to me, you's a clown to me
You can't smoke no Black & Mild with me, get in the car with me
You a funny guy, don't you even joke around with me
How could it be? Get from 'round a G, you grounded from me
I'm a freeband junkie, you a junkie
You getting skinny, I'm getting chunky, getting money
Want some food? Boy, you hungry, I want them hundreds, hundreds

Now if I fuck this model

She get under your skin if you let her
She get under your skin if you-uh
I don't even wanna talk about it

Beautiful morning

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Woo! I'm on my way to an island
And I'm popping shit at the pilot (Fly shit only)
Niggas be broke and be starving
But still talking shit like they violent (Niggas is broke)
They said that they honest, talk money
These niggas gon' say that they got it (Huh?)
Get knocked with the key to success
And these niggas gon' blame it on Khaled
They don't want to see you win (They don't)
They don't want to see the Wraith (No)
You don't want to see your bitch
Caught up in the stars like she outer space
Mansion after condo, condo after mansion
And I'm running out of space
Tell your homie, keep on coming out his mouth
I'm sending somethin' round his way
Niggas barely getting lawyer money
Better get some Sig Sauer money
Running 'round like you Superman
Don't be selfish, get your mom insurance money (Ha)
'Cause I'm the one to put it on your money
I'm the one that make it happen it to you
Niggas with you fuck around and do it for me

Rolls Royce Wraith
Put your bitch up in the stars like she in the airline
Niggas talking 'bout my hair line

I dreamed it all ever since I was young
They said I wouldn't be nothing
Now they always say, "Congratulations" (uh, uh)
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation (uh-huh)
They ain't never had the dedication (uh, uh)
People hatin', say we changed and look, we made it (uh, uh)
Yeah, we made it (uh, uh)

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
They was never friendly, yeah
Now I'm jumping out the Bentley, yeah
And I know I sound dramatic, yeah
But I know I had to have it, yeah
For the money, I'm a savage, yeah
I be itching like a addict, yeah
I'm surrounded, twenty bad bitches, yeah
But they didn't know me last year, yeah
Everyone wanna act like they important (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
But all that mean nothing when I saw my dough, yuh (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Everyone countin' on me, drop the ball, yuh (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Everything custom like I'm at the border, yah, yah
If you fuck with winning, put your lighters to the sky
How could I make cents when I got millions on my mind?
Coming with that bullshit, I just put it to the side
Balling since a baby, they could see it in my eyes

[Chorus: Post Malone & Quavo]
My momma called, seen you on TV, son
Said shit done changed ever since we was on
I dreamed it all ever since I was young
They said I wouldn't be nothing
Now they always say, "Congratulations" (congratulations)
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation (ooh)
They ain't never had the dedication (uh, uh, ayy)
People hatin', say we changed and look we made it (uh, uh)
Yeah, we made it (uh, uh, yah)

[Verse 2: Quavo]
I was patient (yah)
Uh, I was patient (ayy, uh)

Young nigga, young nigga, graduation (yah)

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
We don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do

[Verse 1: Charlie Puth]
I just heard you found the one you've been looking
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
'Cause even after all this time I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily

[Pre-Chorus 1: Charlie Puth]
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's holding onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do

[Verse 2: Selena Gomez]
I just hope you're lying next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then I think you
Might want me to come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong

[Pre-Chorus 2: Selena Gomez]
Don't wanna know
If you're looking into her eyes
If she's holding onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
Like we used to do

[Pre-Chorus 2: Charlie Puth & Selena Gomez]
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's giving it to you just right
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

[Chorus: Charlie Puth & Selena Gomez]
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do

[Outro: Charlie Puth & Selena Gomez]
We don't talk anymore, oh, oh
(What kind of dress you're wearing tonight)
(If he's holding onto you so tight)
The way I did before
We don't talk anymore, oh, woah
(Should've known your love was a game)
(Now I can't get you out of my brain)
Oh, it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore



[Written by Julia Michaels, Justin Tranter, and Justin Bieber]

[Verse 1]
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Verse 2]
I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Bridge]
I'm not just trying to get you back on me
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

Dropped outta school, now we dumb rich (dumb rich)
This sound like some forty-three-oh-one shit (one shit)
All my niggas wanna do is pop style (pop style)
Turn my birthday into a lifestyle (a lifestyle)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Tell my mom I love her if I do not make it (do not make it)
Got so many chains they call me Chaining Tatum
(they do, they do)
And I like to finish what you think you started
Man, you boys just got to Hollywood, you boys just started
You don't know what you just started
All I do is hang with the young and heartless
All this for my family, man, I try my hardest
It's all I ever did and look where it got him
Yeah, you've been on my mind lately
You've still got my number, girl, you need to call me
I feel like they wanna see me learn the hard way
But you know I always handle that one my way
Girl let me rock, rock, rock, rock, rock your body
Justin Timberlake and then I hit the highway
I can't trust no fuckin' body
They still out to get me 'cause they never got me

[Bridge: JAY-Z]
They still out to get me, they don't get it
I cannot be got, and that's a given

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
They like, "Pablo—"
"Why are all the windows tinted on your Tahoe?"
"Why do you know every single bitch that I know?"
"Why can't you just shut your mouth and take the high road?"
Fuck if I know, that's that Chicago
South, south side, that's the motto
Cop a crib and spend ten million on remodel
Take the devils out my life and preach the gospel, 'cause I know
We went way, way past the line of scrimmage, ayy
Throne is back up in it, ayy
In the field like Emmitt, ayy, y'all get so offended, ayy
I be blacking out, I ain't backing out
Jay about his business, and I'ma let you finish, but I
I just, I just, I just, I just wanna rock your body
Take you to the garage and do some karate
Chop it, chop it, chop it, chop it sipping sake
Throw a thick bitch on a Kawasaki (Perfect)

[Chorus: Drake]
Dropped outta school, now we dumb rich (dumb rich)
This sound like some forty-three-oh-one shit (one shit)
All my niggas wanna do is pop style (pop style)

[Instrumental]



[Verse 1]
A man walks down the street
He says, "Why am I soft in the middle, now?
Why am I soft in the middle?
The rest of my life is so hard
I need a photo-opportunity
I want a shot at redemption
Don't want to end up a cartoon
In a cartoon graveyard"
Bonedigger, Bonedigger
Dogs in the moonlight
Far away from my well-lit door
Mr. Beerbelly, Beerbelly
Get these mutts away from me
You know, I don't find this stuff amusing anymore

[Chorus]
If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty, when you call me
You can call me Al

[Verse 2]
A man walks down the street
He says, "Why am I short of attention?
Got a short little span of attention
And, whoa, my nights are so long
Where's my wife and family?
What if I die here?
Who'll be my role model
Now that my rolemodel is
Gone, gone?"
He ducked back down the alley
With some roly-poly little bat-faced girl
All along, along
There were incidents and accidents
There were hints and allegations

[Chorus]
If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty, when you call me
You can call me Al
Call me Al

[Verse 3]
A man walks down the street
It's a street in a strange world
Maybe it's the third world
Maybe it's his first time around
Doesn't speak the language
He holds no currency
He is a foreign man
He is surrounded by the sound, the sound
Cattle in the marketplace
Scatterings and orphanages
He looks around, around
He sees angels in the architecture
Spinning in infinity
He says, "Amen and Hallelujah!"

[Chorus]
If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty, when you call me
You can call me Al
Call me
Na na na na, na na na na

[Outro]
If you'll be my bodyguard
I can call you Betty
If you'll be my bodyguard
I can call you Betty
If you'll be my bodyguard

[Verse]
Look, give me the ball and I won't have to pass it
I ain't passing out until I'm asthma attacking
I take a plan and then I back-to-back it
Hit after hit, check the batting average
I take the work, flip it, acrobatic
Got a little time and a lot of talent
Do a little talking and a lot of action
Seen the competition, hm, not a challenge
I lean, I move, I walk through in this bitch
Packed out, but I can count on my hands who I'ma talk to in this bitch
Girls from law school in this bitch
Yeah, they paralegals
Barely 21, that's very legal
But they doing shit that's probably barely legal, aw, man
It's that nigga that you probably least expected
I just had a couple dots that need connecting
Now your top five getting redirected
From here on out, it'll be consecutive
We making moves like Tarantino, like J.J. Abrams
Moving like Channing Tatum
Moving like Jason Statham
Motherfuck the whole industry
Half of these niggas my mini-me's
I got this bitch going off more than breaking and entering
You hot for a minute, me
I make the shit that last for infinity
Hop in the booth, man, that shit like a gym to me, don't test the agility
Silly, silly, thinking that the negativity you talking could ever fuck up the tranquility
Okay, okay, okay, I'm on Rodeo for the day
If you owe me then you better pay your layaway, away
Stay away, or your ass might get K.O., kay today
Man, that "pew! pew!" hit your ass from like way, a-ways, away

[Hook]
I got the moves
I got the moves (whoa)
I'm making moves

[Outro]
Look, I'm a Don, I'm a Don, I'm a Don (Don)
I gave my whole family jobs and I take care of my Mom
Me and my girl been through so much, that's my partner in crime
Touch any of the above, now you harder to find
Gone



[Verse 1]
Hey, hey, hey

Baby girl, what's  hatnin'?

So pop it for a player
Pop, pop it for me
Turn around and drop it for a player
Drop, drop it for me
I'll rent a beach house in Miami
Wake up with no jammies (Nope)
Lobster tail for dinner

You got it if you want it
Got, got it if you want it
Said you got it if you want it
Take my wallet if you want it now

[Pre-Chorus]
Jump in the Cadillac, girl, let's put some miles on it
Anything you want, just to put a smile on it
You deserve it baby, you deserve it all
And I'm gonna give it to you

[Chorus]
Gold jewelry shining so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Sex by the fire at night
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

[Verse 2]
I'm talkin' trips to Puerto Rico
Say the word and we go
You can be my freaka
Girl, I'll be a fleeko, mamacita
I will never make a promise that I can't keep
I promise that your smile ain't gon' never leave
Shopping sprees in Paris
Everything 24 karats
Take a look in that mirror
Now tell me who's the fairest
Is it you? (is it you?) Is it me? (is it me?)
Say it's us (say it's us) and I'll agree, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Jump in the Cadillac, girl, let's put some miles on it

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Your man on the road, he doin' promo
You said, "Keep our business on the low-low"
I'm just tryna get you out the friend zone
Cause you look even better than the photos
I can't find your house, send me the info
Drivin' through the gated residential
Found out I was comin', sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it but your friends know

[Chorus]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

[Verse 2]
I'ma let you know and keep it simple
Tryna keep it up don't seem so simple
I just fucked two bitches 'fore I saw you
And you gon' have to do it at my tempo
Always tryna send me off to rehab
Drugs started feelin' like it's decaf
I'm just tryna live life for the moment
And all these motherfuckers want a relapse

[Chorus]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

[Bridge]
Hills have eyes, the hills have eyes
Who are you to judge, who are you to judge?
Hide your lies, girl, hide your lies
Only you to trust, only you

[Chorus]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only fuck you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Verse 1]
Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
‘Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I never seen before

[Hook]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love

[Verse 2]
Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

[Hook]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Bridge]
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

[Hook]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Outro]
Ever since I left the city…

Takin' it slow, but it's not typical
He already knows that my love is fire
His heart was a stone, but then his hands roam
I turned him to gold and took him higher

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I'll be your daydream, I'll be your favorite things
We could be beautiful
Get drunk on the good life, I'll take you to paradise
Say you'll never let me go

[Chorus]
Deep in my bones, I can feel you
Take me back to a time only we knew
Hideaway
We could waste the night with an old film
Smoke a little weed on my couch in the back room
Hideaway
Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go

[Post-Chorus]
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh

I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm
I can't keep you from harm
But I'm set on fire to keep you warm
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm

[Post-Chorus: Paige Duddy]
I can't
I can't
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm
I can't
I can't
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm



[Verse 1]
She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen
She had the sightless eyes, telling me no lies
Knocking me out with those American thighs
Taking more than her share, had me fighting for air
She told me to come, but I was already there
'Cause the walls start shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching, and we were making it

[Chorus]
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long

[Verse 2]
Working double-time on the seduction line
She's one of a kind, she's just a-mine all mine
Wanted no applause, just another course
Made a meal outta me, and come back for more
Had to cool me down to take another round
Now, I'm back in the ring to take another swing
That the walls were shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching, and we were making it

[Chorus]
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long
It knocked me out that
You shook me all night long
It had me shaking
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me
Well, you took me

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
You really took me and
You shook me all night long
Ah, you shook me all night long
Yeah, yeah, you shook me all night long
You really got me and you, shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me
Yeah, you shook me
All night long



[Intro]
You know you, you make me feel so good inside
I always wanted a girl just like you
Such a P.Y.T., Pretty Young Thing

[Verse 1]
Where did you come from lady?
And ooh won't you take me there
Right away won't you baby?
Tenderoni you've got to be
Spark my nature
Sugar fly with me
Don't you know now
Is the perfect time
We can make it right
Hit the city lights
Then tonight ease the loving pain
Let me take you to the max

[Hook]
I want to love you (P.Y.T.)

Anywhere you want to go

[Verse 2]
Nothing can stop this burning
Desire to be with you
Got to get to you baby
Won't you come, it's emergency
Cool my fire yearning
Honey, come set me free
Don't you know now is the perfect time
We can dim the lights
Just to make it right
In the night
Hit the loving spot
I'll give you all I've got

[Hook ]
I want to love you (P.Y.T.)
Pretty young thing
You need some lovin' (T.L.C.)

[Intro: Rihanna + Kanye West]
Man I can understand how it might be
Kinda hard to love a girl like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know
Swizz told me let the beat rock

[Verse 1: Kanye West + (Swizz Beatz)]
For all my Southside niggas that know me best
I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex
Why? I made that bitch famous (Goddamn)
I made that bitch famous
For all the girls that got dick from Kanye West
If you see 'em in the streets give 'em Kanye's best
Why? They mad they ain't famous (Goddamn)
They mad they still nameless (Talk that talk, man)
Her man in the store tryna try his best
But he just can't seem to get Kanye fresh
But we still hood famous (Goddamn)
Yeah we still hood famous

[Chorus: Rihanna + Swizz Beatz]
I just wanted you to know
I loved you better than your own kin did
From the very start
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
Wake up, Mr. West! Oh, he's up!
I just wanted you to know

[Verse 2: Kanye West + Swizz Beatz]
I be Puerto Rican day parade floatin'
That Benz Marina Del Rey coastin'
She in school to be a real estate agent
Last month I helped her with the car payment
Young and we alive, whoo!
We never gonna die, whoo!
I just copped a jet to fly over personal debt
Put one up in the sky
The sun is in my eyes, whoo!
Woke up and felt the vibe, whoo!
No matter how hard they try, whoo!
We never gonna die

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I just wanted you to know

[Bridge: Sister Nancy + Swizz Beatz]

[Verse 1]
Hey where did we go
Days when the rains came
Down in the hollow
Playin' a new game
Laughing and a running hey, hey
Skipping and a jumping
In the misty morning fog with
Our hearts a thumpin' and you
My brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

[Verse 2]
Whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow
Going down the old mine
With a transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hiding behind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and sliding
All along the waterfall, with you
My brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

[Chorus]
Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da
Just like that
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da la te da

[Verse 3]
So hard to find my way
Now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day
My, how you have grown
Cast my memory back there, Lord
Sometimes I'm overcome thinking 'bout
Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium with you
My brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

[Chorus]
Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da la te da
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da la te da



[Verse 1]
I threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
And now you're in my way
I trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this
But now you're in my way

[Pre-Chorus]
Your stare was holding
Ripped jeans, skin was showing
Hot night, wind was blowing
Where you think you're going, baby?

[Chorus]
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

[Verse 2]
You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all
But still you're in my way
I beg and borrow and steal
At first sight and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it
But it's in my way

[Pre-Chorus]
Your stare was holding
Ripped jeans, skin was showing
Hot night, wind was blowing
Where you think you're going, baby?

[Chorus]
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

[Bridge]
Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
I missed you so, so bad
Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
And you should know that
I missed you so, so bad

[Breakdown]
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe

[Chorus]
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

[Outro]
Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
I missed you so, so bad
Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
And you should know that
I missed you so, so bad
So call me maybe



[Verse 1]
If you're not the one for me
Then how come I can bring you to your knees?
If you're not the one for me
Why do I hate the idea of being free?
And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holding me the way you do
Oh honey, if I’m not the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through?

[Pre-Chorus]
It's so cold out here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

[Chorus]
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

[Verse 2]
What are you waiting for?
You never seem to make it through the door
And who are you hiding from?
It ain't no life to live like you're on the run
Have I ever asked for much?
The only thing that I want is your love

[Chorus]
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

[Pre-Chorus]
It's so cold in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

[Chorus]
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge

[Outro]
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge (Say it ain't so, say it ain't so)
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge (Say it ain't so, say it ain't so)
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

[Intro]
Open up the champagne, pop!
It's my house, come on, turn it up

[Verse 1]
Hear a knock on the door and the night begins
'Cause we done this before, so you come on in
Make yourself at my home, tell me where you been
Pour yourself something cold, baby, cheers to this

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes you gotta stay in
And you know where I live
Yeah, you know what we is
Sometimes you gotta stay in, in

[Chorus]
Welcome to my house
Baby, take control now
We can't even slow down
We don't have to go out
Welcome to my house
Play that music too loud
Show me what you do now
We don't have to go out
Welcome to my house
Welcome to my house

[Verse 2]
Morning comes and you know that you wanna stay
Close the blinds, let's pretend that the time has changed
Keep our clothes on the floor, open up champagne
Let's continue tonight, come on, celebrate (that's how we do)

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes you gotta stay in
And you know where I live
Yeah, you know what we is
Sometimes you gotta stay in, in

Welcome to my house
Welcome to my house

[Verse 3]
Welcome to my duck off the crib, the spot, the pad
But my house is your house if you throwin' it back
Excuse me if my home's draining the sad
Soon as these happy faces land you can run with the cash
Homerun, slam dunk, touchdown pass
Mi casa es tu casa so it ain't no holding back
Another shot of vodka, you know what's in my glass
It's my house, just relax

[Chorus]
Welcome to my house
Baby, take control now
We can't even slow down
We don't have to go out
Welcome to my house
Play that music too loud
Show me what you do now
We don't have to go out
Welcome to my house
Welcome to my house
Welcome to my house
It's my house

[Verse 1]
Biggest boss and I've been the trillest
I'm a bigger problem when I click with Skrillex
Murder on my mind, it's time to pray to God
My revolver's not religious, the revolution’s born
You wanna know my name then go and tell the sarge
You wanna know my gang: Suicide Squad
Pistol on my waist, I might make a mistake
Deadshot, head shot, oh my God, am I crazy?
Drugs every corner, this is Gotham City
Killer Croc came to kidnap you to cut out your kidney
Ain't no mercy, got that purple Lamborghini lurkin'
Rozay, don't you know that pussy worth it?
Flooded Rolex at the Grammy awards
They still sellin' dope, that's those Miami boys
Killers everywhere, it ain't no place to run
Forgive me for my wrongs, I have just begun

[Hook: Instrumental]
Ain't no mercy, a-ain't no mercy
Got that purple Lamborghini, purple Lamborghini lurkin'
Ain't no mercy, a-ain't no mercy
Got that purple Lamborghini lurkin (Rozay!)

[Verse 2]
Don't be beggin' for your life 'cause that's a lost cause
High stakes, body armor, suicide, boy
It's a time for games and it's a time to kill
Make up your mind, baby, 'cause the time is here
Capital murder, capital letters
Yeah, she catchin' my vibe, but she can't fathom my cheddar
Need a couple gang members for these new endeavors
From this point on anything we do we do together
Body on the corner, million in the trunk
Seven figures, I spend that every other month
Killers on the corner, talons in the clip
Build a palace out in Paris just to fill with bitches
Say my name and I’m coming with the gun squad
Everybody runnin', homie, there’s only one God
Cocaine white Ferrari, I'm in the fast lane
Every day was life and death, that's when the cash came
Count money, drug residue, even blood on ‘em
He had a driver 'til I put my cuz on it
Kickin' in the door, boy, Suicide Squad
Needle in my arm so I'm do or die for it

[Hook: Instrumental]
Ain't no mercy, a-ain't no mercy
Got that purple Lamborghini, purple Lamborghini lurkin'
Ain't no mercy, a-ain't no mercy
Got that purple Lamborghini lurkin', (Rozay!)

[Video Intro]
Je fais le même rêve tous les soirs

[Verse 1]
Everybody here wants you
My love, my love
And I know that you want them too
My love, my love
I ask you what your heart desires
My love, my love
You tell me I'm the only one
My love, my love

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a lie, a lie
I catch you every time
In your lust, your lust
Every time you close your eyes

[Chorus]
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'

[Verse 2]
You told me not to worry 'bout
Those guys, those guys
You told me that you left it all behind
Behind

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a lie, a lie
I catch you every time
In your lust, your lust
Every time you close your eyes

[Chorus]
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'

[Bridge]
Wipe the...
Lust from your eyes
I see that you're not mine
I can see the lust in your eyes
You can't hide it
You can't be the one
I realize, we're divided

[Chorus]
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'



[Chorus 1]
Once I was 7 years old my momma told me
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was 7 years old

[Verse 1]
It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

[Chorus 2]
Once I was 11 years old my daddy told me
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
Once I was 11 years old

[Verse 2]
I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

[Chorus 3]
Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once I was 20 years old

(Lukas Graham!!!)

[Verse 3]
I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

[Chorus 4]
Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
I was writing 'bout everything, I saw before me
Once I was 20 years old
Soon we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon we'll be 30 years old

[Verse 4]
I'm still learning about life
My woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs
And I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me
Some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind
My brother I'm still sorry

[Bridge]
Soon I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month

[Chorus 5]
Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
Soon I'll be 60 years old
Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can hold me
Soon I'll be 60 years old

[Chorus 1 recap]
Once I was seven years old, my momma told me
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old

Once I was seven years old



[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
When it's cold outside I've got the month of May
I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?

[Chorus]
My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl, my girl

[Verse 2]
I've got so much honey, the bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song, than the birds in the trees
Well, I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?

[Chorus]
My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl, my girl

[Bridge]
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Ooh, yeah

[Verse 3]
I don't need no money, fortune, or fame
I've got all the riches baby, one man can claim
Well, I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?

[Chorus]
My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl, my girl


[Outro]
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
With my girl
I've even got the month of May
With my girl
Talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout my girl

Don't you open up that window

You know you gotta go get it, go get it, my nigga

Lord, I'm on fire, they think that I'm Satan
Callin' me crazy on different occasions
Kickin' the cameraman off of my stages
'Cause I don't like how he snappin' my angles
I'm overboard and I'm over-impatient
Over my niggas and these kids my ages
Dealin' with Mo' shit that's more complicated

If you wanna roll, I got a place where...

[Verse 1: FRENSHIP]
Up at night I'm awake cause it haunts me
That I never got to say what I wanted
*Oh my God, oh my God*
I’m not the same as I was with you
I would jump out my skin just to get you
*Oh my God, oh my God*

[Pre-Chorus: FRENSHIP]
How could you have ever known
If I never let it show, now I just wanna know are you?

[Chorus: Emily Warren]
Yeah, I'm fine
Drop tears in the morning
Give in to the lonely
Here it comes with no warning
Capsize, I'm first in the water
Too close to the bottom
I'm right back where I started
Said I'm fine

[Verse 2: FRENSHIP]
Your silhouette is burned in my memory
Rubble left from the moment that you left me
*Oh my God, oh my God*
And three words have never come easy
Cause you're more than they ever could be
*Oh my God, oh my God*

[Pre-Chorus: FRENSHIP]
How could you have ever known

Climb on board
We'll go slow and high tempo
Light and dark
Hold me hard and mellow

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm seeing the pain, seeing the pleasure
Nobody but you, 'body but me

I love to hold you close, tonight and always
I love to wake up next to you
I love to hold you close, tonight and always
I love to wake up next to you

[Chorus]
So we'll piss off the neighbours
In the place that feels the tears
The place to lose your fears

A place that is so pure, so dirty and raw
In the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day
Fucking and fighting on
It's our paradise and it's our war zone
It's our paradise and it's our war zone

[Verse 2]
Pillow talk
My enemy, my ally
Prisoners
Then we're free, it's a thin line

[Hook]
If I was the question, would you be my answer?
If I was the music, would you be the dancer?
If I was the student, would you be the teacher?
If I was the sinner, would you be the preacher?
Would you be my...
N' dun d-dun dun
I still got a lot of shit to learn, I'll admit it
N' dun d-dun dun
I still got a lot of shit to learn, I'll admit it

[Verse 1]
Feeling like a digit in a system, just another stupid number
I don't know, know, know
Everything is twisted, I can feel it
It's another stupid summer where it's cold, cold, cold
And we can do it on our own
Head up to a place where baby no one goes
In a rocket full of liquor, in a Polaroid for pictures
Baby you should stop me, 'fore I lose control

[Refrain]
How imperfect a person am I?
Go through your purse and put on your disguise
You see the stars, but they just see the skies
And you see my scars, what do they see?

We still got a lot of shit to learn, just admit it
N' dun d-dun dun
We still got a lot of shit to learn, don't you get it?

[Verse 2]
Got your finger on the trigger and you aiming'at the mirror
Don't you shoot, that ain't you, nah
Cause on the outside you pretending
But you hurtin' in the inner, what's the truth, what's the truth now?

[Refrain]
How imperfect a person am I?
Go through your purse and put on your disguise
You see the stars, but they just see the skies
And you see my scars what do they see?

Bad bitches is the..
Mike WiLL Made-It
Yeah

[Hook: Swae Lee]
I don't got no type
Bad bitches is the only thing that I like
You ain't got no life
Cups with the ice and we do this every night
I ain't check the price
I make my own money, so I spend it how I like
I'm just livin' life
And let my mama tell it, nigga, I ain't livin' right

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Chop the top off the Porsche, that's a headless horse
Extendo long as an extension cord
Bitch, I ball like Jordan and I play full court
And if you not my type then you know I got to keep this shit short
What you know about a check? What you got up in your pocket?
What you spending when you shopping, dawg?
Why you wanna go flex? Like you all in the mix
Like you got some shit popping off
I got some models that you see up in the movies
And they want to make a flick for the camera
Wanna be Kim Kardashian, heard I was livin' like a bachelor

[Hook: Swae Lee]
I don't got no type
Bad bitches is the only thing that I like
You ain't got no life
Cups with the ice and we do this every night
I ain't check the price
I make my own money, so I spend it how I like
I'm just livin' life
And let my mama tell it, nigga, I ain't livin' right

[Verse 2: Slim Jimmy]
Spend it how I like, sinnin' every night
Push start the whip, brought it straight to life
Blowin' on the kush, 'til I'm out of sight
I don't check the price, all I do is swipe
She said, "What's your type?", I said, "I like what I like"
I don't second guess, I just roll the dice (keep it moving)
Keep your two cents, take your own advice
I've been livin' life, like I lived twice

[Hook: Swae Lee]
I don't got no type
Bad bitches is the only thing that I like
You ain't got no life
Cups with the ice and we do this every night
I ain't check the price
I make my own money, so I spend it how I like
I'm just livin' life
And let my mama tell it, nigga, I ain't livin' right

I don't got no type, I don't got no type

Cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it
Cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it
Them bricks is way too hot, you need to cut it
Your price is way too high, you need to cut it

[Verse 1: O.T. Genasis]
Run up them bands on the regular, hittin' my plug on the cellular
Tell my ex bitch that I'm sorry, Imma skate off in the 'Rari
Keep 36 by my side, Imma go bake me a pie
Keep 45 on my side, fuck with my niggas, you die
All of my niggas say blood, all of my niggas say cuh
OT, I found me a plug, I got it straight out the mud
Keep it a hundred, no bull, I fell in love with the drugs
Bustin' it down in the tub, pay me my money in dubs
Water whippin', lookin' like I'm fishin'
Baseball in kitchen, with my arm I'm pitchin'
Rolie on, it's glistenin', and my darling, kissin'
Niggas steady trippin' so I'm steady grippin'
Dirty money on me, got a scale up on me
I don't fuck with phony, 'bout to sell a pony
All these niggas on me, all these bitches on me
Say my price is good, motherfucker, show me

[Hook: O.T. Genasis]

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
Went and bought a 911 with my trap money
A million up but still ain't never touch my rap money
I'm out in LA fuckin' with that boy OT
Flew to LA, got a plug on that OG
You know I've been gettin' money if you know me
When I first met my plug, I told him, "I piss a hundred G's"
I ain't comin' to get it unless you got a hundred piece
I don't want it, fuck it, your price, you need to cut it
Your ice, you need to tuck it, she fuck with me, she lucky
A half a million, all 20s in that Gucci luggage
Let's skip the small talk, it's time to talk numbers
Young nigga playin' with commas, might go get a Lamb for the summer
I've been outchea in these streets all my life hustlin'
My nigga beefin' then I'm beefin', wrong or right I'm bustin'
My traphouse, I love it
Put some Forgis on my old school and I had to gut it
But should I put a roof in?

[Hook: O.T. Genasis]
Cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it
Cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it
Them bricks is way too hot, you need to cut it
Your price is way too high, you need to cut it
Cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it
Cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it
Them bricks is way too hot, you need to cut it
Your price is way too high, you need to cut it

But I know what they want from me, dollars, lot of stock in me

When there's a boss in me, I'll be damned

I think about all the time
Think you may need all of mine
Hate to say you know that love is blind
I'm 'bout to see, I'll close my eyes
(Truth is) They can't see you in here though
Most of them need dollar signs to make
Every day your birthday
And every night your Valentine…

[Chorus]
If we
Tried that we could be
Somewhere in the climate
Is warm, long as you around me
I swear that everything will be just fine
I wish that we could take some time
Go anywhere, baby I don’t mind
Grown man, in my suit and tie
Hey, there's no we without you and I
Oh, yea, ah yea, ah ah yea
Hey, there's no we without you and I
Oh yea, ah yea, ah ah yea
Hey, there's no we without you and I

[Verse 2]
See my baby know
Where my baby go, I go
It's no better feeling, you know
When I’m next to her for sure
It's like you on my mind all day
Get this off my chest
Ah damn, I know I love you
I swear your shit the best
Friends, they know they hate
Get that off my chest
Ah yeah, I think I love you
Oh baby, maybe...

[Chorus]
If we
Tried that we could be
Somewhere in the climate

[Intro]
Doin' well dog
Yeah, me and all my
Yeah, me—yeah

[Hook]
Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well, dog
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell, dog
Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself, dog
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still here, dog

[Verse 1]
How did I finesse all of this shit from Jane and Weston?
Girls all in my bed and they don't trip off first impressions
Girls all in your bed and they just ask a hundred questions
I can't fuck with you no more cause you be actin' extra
Do your favorite rapper like my son, like my son though
Nothing mutual about my funds, 'bout my funds though
All you niggas fightin' over crumbs, where the bread at?
How they feel about you where you're from, where yo bed at?
I don't need no pill to speak my mind, I don't need that
I make people pay me for my time, yeah, I need that
And I see your girl like all the time, all the time though
I can't tell you if she's yours or mine but I do know

[Hook]
Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well, dog
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell, dog
Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself, dog
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still here, dog

[Verse 2]
Oh and I'm back, dog
Oh, you just went and turned your back, dog
I thought that we were family
You showed me that we can't be
I gotta talk to God even though He isn't near me
Based on what I got, it's hard to think that He don't hear me
Hittin' like that 30 on my jersey, man, I'm gifted
Whole lot of sixes but I'm still like
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
6-point star, Lion of the Judah
All my niggas ain't off rockin' Gucci
One do it then we all gotta do it
Got the key, now the doors open and we all goin' through it
Whole city at your head for the boy
I ain't even gotta call no one for it

[Hook]
Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well, dog
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell, dog
Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself, dog
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still—

[Outro]
Wow, all praise to the most high up...



[Verse 1: Marc E. Bassy]
Girl you party all the time
Don't let me stay on your mind
Adderall and cheap wine
Just to stay awake in conversation
We were always so damn insecure
So how could we ever know for sure
And disregard the way I know we feel
That would make this city way too real

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
If we bump into each other
On a crowded street
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me
We’re just strangers in passing casually
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me

[Verse 2: Marc E. Bassy]
The shirt on my back with the rips
Gems in my golden necklace
You didn't give me none of this
There's nothing for me to miss
We were too young on the day we met
How could we say we would not forget
And in the shadows there's a place for us
Somewhere hidden they can't find our love
Don't let 'em know

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
If we bump into each other
On a crowded street
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me
We’re just strangers in passing casually
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Eazy, and these days it's just you and me
This shit is dead and gone, it's not what it used to be
Someone give a eulogy
Know I'm hard headed and I might of acted foolishly
But you the one to hold us down usually
We was in a limbo
But of all people you ain't have to fuck with him though
That was my homie I had gave y'all the intro
Some things fall apart and some get thrown out the window
Remember when we first met we might've been too young
But we was from The Bay so we both was going too dumb
I used to be the one for you now you got a new one
So till the next lifetime, maybe we can do some'n
Eazy

[Hook: Marc E. Bassy]
If we bump into each other
On a crowded street
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me
We’re just strangers in passing casually
It’s not us no more It’s just you and me

[Outro: Marc E. Bassy]
If we bump into each other
On a crowded street
It's not us no more

When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only
Only light we see
No, I won't be afraid
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, I won't be afraid
Just as long, just as long
Just as long as you stand by me

Now darling, darling
Whenever I'm in trouble
Darling, won't you stand
I need just a little helping hand
Now, now, now
And darling, darling
Won't you stand by me

If the sky we look upon, now, now
Should tumble and fall
All of the mountains may crumble
May crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry
No, no, no, no, no, I won't shed no tears
Just as long, just as long
Just as long as you stand by me

Now darling, darling
I said, I need somebody right now
I need just a little helping hand
Need someone to come pick me up
And let you stand by me
Come on, come on, now, baby, yeah
Baby, come on, come on and stand, stand by me

Mama pajama rolled outta bed, and she ran to the police station
When Papa found out, he began to shout, and he started the investigation
It's against the law, it was against the law
What the mama saw, it was against the law

The mama looked down and spit on the ground every time my name gets mentioned
The papa said "Oy! if I get that boy
I'm gonna stick him in the house of detention"

[Hook]
Well I'm on my way, I don't know where I'm going

Seein', me and Julio down by the schoolyard

In a couple of days they're gonna take me away
But the press let the story leak
When the radical priest come to get me released
We was all on the cover of Newsweek

[Hook]
Well I'm on my way, I don't know where I'm going

Don't worry, be happy
In every life we have some trouble
But when you worry you make it double
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy now

Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy

[Verse 2]
Ain't got no place to lay your head
Somebody came and took your bed
Don't worry, be happy
The landlord say your rent is late
He may have to litigate
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy (Look at me, I'm happy)

[Chorus]
Don't worry, be happy
(Hey I'll give you my phone number, when you worry call me I'll make you happy!)
Don't worry, be happy

[Verse 3]
Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style
Ain't got no gal to make you smile
But don't worry, be happy
'Cause when you worry your face will frown
And that will bring everybody down
So don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy now

[Chorus]
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy

[Bridge]
Now there is the song I wrote
I hope you learned it note for note, like good little children
Don't worry, be happy
Now listen to what I said, in your life expect some trouble
When you worry you make it double
But don't worry, be happy, be happy now

[Chorus]
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
(Don't worry, don't worry, don't do it, be happy
Put a smile on your face
Don't bring everybody down like this
Don't worry, it will soon pass whatever it is)
Don't worry, be happy
I'm not worried



[Verse 1]
Let's go out and be wild
Do it while we can (do, do)
Runnin' free in the world
We've got all weekend (do, do)

[Refrain]
Tear it up, tear it down
Gettin' lost in the sound of our hearts beatin'
Take me here, take me now
Gettin' lost in a crowd with you

[Chorus]
Up, all night
I waited for you all my life
Hold my hand and keep me close
I'll never let you go
No not tonight
Keep me by your side
Keep me by your side
Keep me by your

[Verse 2]
Scattered hearts, broken glass
I don't feel a thing (do, do)
'Cause I'm frozen in time
When you're next to me (do, do)

[Refrain]
Tear it up, tear it down
Gettin' lost in the sound of our hearts beatin'
Take me here, take me now
Gettin' lost in a crowd with you

[Chorus]
Up, all night
I waited for you all my life
Hold my hand and keep me close
I'll never let you go

[Verse 1]
Looking back when we were younger
Sneaking out to feed the hunger
Oh, nobody knows

[Verse 2]
Getting caught behind the station
Remember that policeman chased us
Oh, nobody knows

[Pre-Chorus]
We have come so far
We can't turn back now
Let me walk you down this road

[Chorus]
Follow me, follow me when its dark out
I will be, I will be your lighthouse
And if you're lost, ohhh
I'll lead you back home
Follow me, follow me

[Verse 3]
There was a time you told me secrets
But you were scared I wouldn't keep them
Oh, but nobody knows

[Verse 4]
We used to smoke and watch the airplanes
Making-out as the ground shake
Oh, still nobody knows

[Pre-Chorus]
We have come so far
We can't turn back now
Let me walk you down this road

[Chorus]
Follow me, follow me when its dark out
I will be, I will be your lighthouse
And if you're lost, ohhh
I'll lead you back home
Follow me, follow me

Follow me, follow me when its dark out
I will be, I will be...

Follow me, follow me when its dark out
I will be, i will be your lighthouse
And if you're lost, ohhh
I'll lead you back home
Follow me, follow me
Follow me, follow me
Follow me, follow me



[Verse 1]
Starin' at two different views on your window ledge
Coffee is going cold, it's like time froze
There you go wishin', floatin' down our wishin' well
It's like I'm always causin' problems, causin' hell
I didn't mean to put you through this, I can tell
We cannot sweep this under the carpet

[Chorus]
I hope that I can turn back the time
To make it all alright, all alright for us
I'll promise to build a new world for us two
With you in the middle

[Break]
(With you in the middle)
(With you in the middle)

[Verse 2]
Lyin' down beside you, what's goin' through your head?
The silence in the air felt like my soul froze
Am I just overthinking feelings I conceal?
This gut feeling I'm tryna get off me as well
I hope we find our missin' pieces and just chill
We cannot sweep it under the carpet

[Chorus]
I hope that I can turn back the time
To make it all alright, all alright for us
I'll promise to build a new world for us two
With you in the middle

[Break]
(With you in the middle)
(With you in the middle)
(With you)

[Outro]
(You)
站在中间，有谁站在中间
(You)
站在中间，有谁站在中间



[Intro]
Diamonds really diamonds
And I'm shining bright ‘cause I'm really grindin'
They ask me if I'm real, I say, "Is you serious?"
My daughter gon' love this bitch here

[Hook]
All my diamonds shine ‘cause they really diamonds
Bad bitches in line, they be really trying
They ask me if I'm high, I say, "Really really"
Got money on my mind, I say, "Really really"
I look like I been ballin' ‘cause I'm really ballin'
I won't apologize, I'm not really sorry
They ask me if I'm lyin', I say, "Really really"
I'm really out my mind, I say, "Really really"
Really really

[Verse 1]
Make 'em believe, I made 'em believe
A lyrical song writer and he can sing
Bringing in money like raking in leaves
I was just trying to get paper to sneeze
Achoo, that was a blessing
She special to you, I don't look at her special
Actually, I treat her regular
Not being seen, we not making no spectacle
Gates had her first then he gave her to Kevin
All the above, we do all the et cetera
Scared of the feds, had to switch up my cellular
He talking reckless, don't call me back ever
Passing through Gardere to holler at Glover
Shout out to Black, shout out to Cedric
Grey Monte Carlo, cocaine 911
Just hollered at Trav, I'm like the Reverend
My section ridiculous, watch where you steppin'
Pockets on indigent, can't be too careful
Steve like 'em tall and when they yellow
Broke and in college, fresh with low mileage
I like 'em black, pretty white teeth
Body unique, booty on fleek
Jhené Aiko, chewing her cheeks
Groceries, please, you know that was me

[Hook]
All my diamonds shine ‘cause they really diamonds
Bad bitches in line, they be really trying
They ask me if I'm high, I say, "Really really"
Got money on my mind, I say, "Really really"
I look like I been ballin' ‘cause I'm really ballin'
I won't apologize, I'm not really sorry
They ask me if I'm lyin', I say, "Really really"
I'm really out my mind, I say, "Really really"
Really really

[Verse 2]
Diving be treacherous (Swim)
Pray to God that don't nobody mess with us (Him)
Keep it strong in case anyone testing us
Right or wrong, if it's this, you don't mess with it
When yo' bitch over here I don't mess with her
No detective work, I don't be questioning
Where she been, trying to read all of her messages
I don't speak on no man, that's irregular
Take her phone, disconnectin' her cellular
What you need that for undressin' her?
What you need that for caressin' her?
Spreading her legs 'bout to pleasure her
Pulling her hair from the back, go to pressin' her
Trying to see who tap first, made a bet with her
Relationship flaking, no eczema
She catching feelings, she say we inseparable
Oyster Perpetual, it's not a replica
Mustang GT in the streets, smoking vegetables
Trunk in the front, do it make me a elephant?
I really really put syrup in my beverages
Shopping in Beverly, check out my etiquette
Loving my swag, women tailor keep checking it
Carats, they glisten in all of my necklaces
Feeling myself, really thought it was evident

[Hook]
All my diamonds shine ‘cause they really diamonds
Bad bitches in line, they be really trying
They ask me if I'm high, I say, "Really really"
Got money on my mind, I say, "Really really"
I look like I been ballin' ‘cause I'm really ballin'
I won't apologize, I'm not really sorry
They ask me if I'm lyin', I say, "Really really"
I'm really out my mind, I say, "Really really"
Really really

[Outro]
Really really
Really really

[Intro: Big Sean]
Uh-huh, oh, yeah, look

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Okay I know what it feel like to be young and single
You know the life when your pockets got a bunch of singles
You know taking double shots, saying fuck a single
You know, hardly getting sleep but it's the fuckin' dream though
Look, I know what it feel like to think you found the one
Told mom that so many times that I'm sounding dumb
Cause she started to mix Ashley up with Tanesha
And saying "Hi Britney" when I'm on the phone with Lisa
Fuck it, I got some new hoes, I mean some XXX girls
Pussy get wet as an S-Curl
Then I started thinkin' 'bout my ex-ex-ex girl
And how it was the worst times but she was the best girl
You know, good girl, bad time, right place, wrong mind
Got my mind right, hit her back, brrr, the wrong line
(The number you dialed has been disconnected)
Man, but before I started feeling bad
My nigga text me like "I got some hoes, hit me back"
Fuck it

[Hook: Jeremih]
Oh I could let you down
When you trip, I'll take you anywhere, I take ya
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world
Thank God I'm with my girl
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world
Thank God I'm with my girl

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
You be the momma, you be the daddy
Baby we could play house, I'll change your addy
Or even change my palate and fuck with salad
Put me in the picture, let's change your avi, oh, oh, oh
Can't even stunt I was sprung from the jump
Never got head while flaming up the blunt
You were my first, I'm just saying
More folks should try it, it's crazy
Focus, selfish moments, on road, I done have my share
Flying out of town like baby don't mind my player
Sleepy arguments via texts while I buy my beer
And the air so tired I forget to recline my chair
Picture you in my head, a souvenir by my legs
Some scuba gear for the bed, we do it cause simon says
Ain't a single living thing that likes living single
We good over here, that's all that we know

[Hook: Jeremih]
Oh I could let you down
When you trip, I'll take you anywhere, I take ya
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world
Thank God I'm with my girl
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
You know it right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world
Thank God I'm with my girl

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
To the one girl guys who claim they don't need more
Like my nigga Henry, he married at 24
I'm like why nigga, why?
You supposed to be with her longer than your ass been alive?
He like "ahhh"
Fuck it, we about to do therapy
Aye, at least when I hit the doctor I'm care free with no plan b's
You probably never got tested and have that type of clarity
I'd rather live my life with that lifetime guarantee
But I'm down to hear the stories about what your hoes do
It’s probably more entertaining than me talking about my wife down in Whole Foods
Or how I'm with her I feel whole too
Go ahead, keep living that life you niggas know you too old too
Fuck it, I started laughing and pretend like I ain't listen
Even though he's on target with everything I've been missing
The closest thing I had to that came in at 4AM and out at 8 for work
And I'm the reason we ain't make it work
That's what makes it worse

[Hook: Jeremih]
Oh I could let you down
When you trip, I'll take you anywhere, I take ya
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world
Thank God I'm with my girl
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world
Thank God I'm with my girl



[Intro]
It's been a long time
I guess I just miss the old days
You remember...all them times

[Verse 1]
You used to come keep me company
Tell me you love me and just me
Oh and it took a while to trust me
Girl I had to work for it
Still you don't judge me
I love the way you touch me
I'm feeling like I'm 'bout to lose you
With all the shady shit I do to you
Some things are better left unsaid
I can't get it out my head
Better left unsaid
Everything that I regret
No lie girl when I tell you, you a blessing (you a blessing)
Girl just let me make corrections, yeah
Damn, I've been stressing yeah
I've been really tripping babe
I learned my lesson, yeah
I still need you to listen, oh babe

[Hook]
Listen to me yeah
Oh if you'd just let me explain
If you'd just let me explain
Baby, oh (yeah)
Listen to me yeah, yeah
Oh if you'd just let me explain
If you'd just let me explain
Baby, oh

Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid

[Verse 2]
Don't be afraid to tell me that it's over
Tell me that it's over
No, I don't deserve you, the shit I never told you
There's too many things, I can't look you in the face
I just grab you by the waist and act like everything's okay
Bare with me girl, I'm trying to be honest
Tell you what you need to hear, just not yet
I'm barely getting started, I'm being cautious
Girl that's the hardest
All we been through, look what we've been through
Look at Jay and Bey, they going through some shit too
We made it through the struggle let's make it through this too
I got a confession, baby will you listen to it?

[Hook]
Listen to me yeah (oh yeah)
Oh if you'd just let me explain (just let me explain)
If you'd just let me explain (oh yeah)
Baby oh (baby oh)
Listen to me yeah (oh baby oh)
Oh if you'd just let me explain (baby oh)
Baby oh
Yeah (baby, oh)

[Outro]
Young Tiller!



[Verse 1]
Lighting stog after stog, I choke on the smoke
They tell me to quit, don't listen what I'm told
Help me forget that this world is so cold
I don't even know what I'm chasin' no more
Tell me what I want, just keep searchin' on
It's never enough, cup after cup
Blunt after blunt
I wouldn't give one if I could find a fuck, ha, ha, ha, uh
In the cut and I put that on my momma
And my bitch called talkin' 'bout some drama
I swear there ain't no time for women on the come up
It's either the pussy or the commas

[Chorus]
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

[Verse 2]
Uh, yeah, push the gas, get a motherfuckin' nose bleed
She ain't never met a youngin' do it like me
She got a man but she says she really like me
She doin' things to excite me
She sendin' all her friends snaps of my new tracks
'Cause all these hoes know whats about to come next
I hit my plug up, got the paper connect
I drop a couple bands I just wanna go...

[Chorus]
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

[Bridge]
Knowing all of this, it just don't make a difference
I'm just talking shit to the ones that'll listen
I come with the heat man, I swear I'm never missing
And I'm still the same and I swear I'm never switching
Knowing all of this, it just don't make a difference
I'm just talking shit to the ones that'll listen
I come with the heat man, I swear I'm never missing
And I'm still the same and I swear I'm never switching

[Chorus]
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
Cold with the flex



[Intro]
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive (I never felt so alive)
I never felt so alive (I never felt so alive)

[Interlude]
Catch me, don't you—
Catch me, don't you catch me
I've fallen in love for the first time
I wanna cry
And I ain't even tryna fight it
Don't wanna die (Don't wanna die no more)
'Cause now you're here and I just wanna be
Right by your side
On any night that you be crying, baby
I'll dry your eyes
I'll dry your eyes

[Verse]
Every time you go to sleep you look like you in Heaven
Plus the head game is stronger than a few Excedrin
You shine just like the patent leather on my new 11's
You read me like a book like I'm the Bible, you the Reverend
Yeah, I wanna tell the truth to you
I wanna talk about my days as a youth to you
Exposing you to all my demons and the reasons I'm this way
I would like to paint a picture, but it'll take more than a day
It would take more than some years to get all over all my fears
Preventing me from letting you see all of me perfectly clear
The same wall that's stopping me from letting go and shedding tears
From the lack of having father, and the passing of my peers
While I'm too scared to expose myself
It turns out, you know me better than I know myself
Better than I know myself
Well how 'bout that?

[Outro]
She gets him (you get me)
She hugs him (you kiss me)
You tell me you miss me
And I believe you, I believe you
She gets him (you get me)
She hugs him (you kiss me)
You tell me you miss me
And I believe you, I believe you
Catch me, don't you—
Catch me, don't you catch me
I've fallen in love for the first time



[Verse 1]
Bathroom stalls for the powder nose (she loves)
High heel shoes with the open toes (she loves)
She's got a good time wrapped in gold  (she loves)
For you, for you
All red dress with the devil eyes (she loves)
So obsessed with the camera lights (she loves)
You love her, but you can't deny (she loves)
The truth, the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
She loves everybody
Can't you tell by the signs?
She loves everybody
She gets off all the time
It's a dark philosophy
And it haunts her constantly
It's a false alarm to me
She's a false alarm

[Chorus]
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)

[Verse 2]
Six inch long, 'bout three inch wide (she loves)
Dolla, dolla bill is her only type (she loves)
You love her but you'll never be (she loves)
The one, the one
Diamonds and the rings are her fantasy (she loves)
She chase hearts with the Hennessy (she loves)
You love her, but you'll never be (she loves)
Enough, enough

[Pre-Chorus]
She loves everybody
Can't you tell by the signs?
She loves everybody
She gets off all the time
It's a dark philosophy
And it haunts her constantly
She's a false alarm to me
She's a false alarm

[Chorus]
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)

[Bridge]
She always leaves the man she loves
But the diamonds are forever
She always seems to be alone
But the diamonds make it better

[Chorus]
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)



[Intro]

Runnin' her hands through my 'fro
Bouncin' on twenty fo's
While they sayin' on the radio

Hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rollin' that body
Got every man in here wishin'
Sippin' on coke and rum (rum)

It's the freakin' weekend
Baby I'm about to have me some fun (fun)

Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce
C'mon

[Verse 2]
Now it's like "Murda She Wrote"
Once I get cha out them clothes
Privacy is on the door
But still they can hear you screaming more
Girl I'm feelin' whatchu feelin'
No more hopin' and wishin'
I'm about to take my key and
Stick it in the ignition

[Pre-Hook]
So gimme dat "Toot toot"
And lemme give ya that "Beep beep"
Runnin' her hands through my 'fro
Bouncin' on twenty fo's

Cristal poppin' in the stretch Navigator
We got food everywhere, as if the party was catered
We've got fellas to my left (left)
Honies on my right (right)
We bring 'em both together, we got jukin' all night
Then after the show, it's the after party
And after the party, it's the hotel lobby
Yeah, around about four you gotta clear the lobby
Then take it to ya room and freak somebody

[Pre-Hook]

[Outro]
Girl, we off in this Jeep
Foggin' windows up
Blastin' the radio
In the back of my truck
Bouncin' up and down
Strokin' round and round
To the remix
We just thuggin' it out

[Pre-Hook: Big Sean]
Uh, fuck, I don't fuck with you
You lil stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
You lil, you lil dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you, lil stupid ass

[Hook: Big Sean]
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I heard you got a new man, I see you takin' a pic
Then you post it up, thinkin' that it's makin' me sick
I see you callin', I be makin' it quick
I'ma answer that shit, like, "I don't fuck with you."
Bitch, I got no feelings to go
I swear I had it up to here, I got no ceilings to go
I mean, for real, fuck how you feel
Fuck your two cents if it ain't goin' towards the bill
Yeah, and everyday I wake up celebratin' shit
Why? ‘Cause I just dodged a bullet from a crazy bitch
I stuck to my guns, that's what made me rich
That's what put me on, that's what got me here
That's what made me this
And everything that I do is my first name (B-I-G)
These hoes chase bread, aw damn, she got a bird brain
Ain't nothin' but trill in me, aw man, silly me
I just bought a crib, three stories; that bitch a trilogy
And you know I'm rollin' weed that's fuckin' up the ozone
I got a bitch that text me she ain't got no clothes on
And then another one text, then your ass next
And I'ma text your ass back, like…

[Pre-Hook: Big Sean]
I don't fuck with you
You lil stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
You lil, you lil dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you, lil stupid ass

[Hook: Big Sean]
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

[Verse 2: E-40]
Got a million things on my mind, executive deals online
Limited amount of time, chasin' these dollar signs
And you ain't on your grind
You liable to find me up in the MGM casino in the D
Fuckin' off fetti I could've put on property
From the Bay to the Murder Mitten
My niggas put murder missions
She choosin', that's her decision, free my niggas in prison
On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit
For a pimp but make a nigga hella rich
Got a blunt in my dental, blowin' hemp in a rental
On my way to Sacramento, late night; Arsenio
I'm never sentimental, go hard or go homeless
Barely Harley, I'm chromeless, you might end up domeless
I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me
I'll make a bitch stand outside forever, like the Statue of Liberty
Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South
I raise my styrofoam up, and pour some drink in my mouth
Why you always coming around with bad news?
Say you want me to win, but hope I lose
Askin' if I rock with other niggas in the crew
But them niggas cool, it's just that…

[Pre-Hook: Big Sean + (E-40)]
Bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you (Lil biatch!)
You lil stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you (Nuh-uh!)
You lil, you lil dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you, lil stupid ass

[Hook: Big Sean]
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
I got a new chick that I gotta thank God for
I got a new whip that I gotta thank the lot for
Yeah, I got a lot but want a lot more
Yeah, we in the buildin', but I'm tryna take it to the top floor
I swear I hear some new bullshit every day I'm wakin' up
It seem like nowadays everybody breakin' up
That shit can break you down if you lose a good girl
I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up
I guess drama makes for the best content
Everything got a bad side, even a conscience
Now you're drinkin' 'til you're unconscious
Feel me when you get a fine bitch
Just don't forget to read the fine print
Life got me meditatin', like I'm in the Himalayas
Keep it G with the L lit on me, like the elevator
Yeah, I know that karma's too real
So I hope you doin' cool, but still…

[Outro: Big Sean]
Stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
Little stupid ass… I ain't fuckin with…
I ain't fuckin'… I ain't, I ain't fuckin' with you
I ain't fuckin' with you (Straight up)



[Intro: DJ Khaled]
Would you fuck me for free?
Another one
We the Best Music! Major Key! DJ Khaled!

[Verse 1: Drake]
I go on and on
Can't understand how I last so long
I must have the superpowers
Last 223 thousand hours
And it's cause I'm off of CC
And I'm off the Hennessy
And like your boy from Compton said
You know this dick ain't free!
I got girls that I shoulda made pay for it
Got girls that I shoulda made wait for it
Got girls that'll cancel a flight back home
Stay another day for it
You got attitude on na na
And your pussy on agua
And your stomach on flat flat
And your ass on what's that?
And, yeah, I need it all right now
Last year I had drama, girl not right now
I was never gon' chat what we talkin' about
You the only one I know could fit it all in her... man

[Chorus: Drake]
I always wonder if you ask yourself
Is it just me?
Is it just me?
Or is this sex so good I shouldn't have to fuck for free?
Is it just me?
Is it just me?
Or is this sex so good I shouldn't have to...

[Verse 2: Drake]
Fuck for free
I know you workin' day and night to get a college degree
Bet nobody that you've been with even know you a freak, right?
You know you only do that with me, right?
Yeah, double checkin' on you
You know I never put the pressure on you
You know that you make your own mind up
You knew what it was when you signed up
Now you gotta run it up
I be out of words, tryna sum it up
Girl you throw it back like one love
Even let me splash on the tour bus
Yeah I talk to her but she don't do enough
Even though you in the hood I'm still pullin' up
Dip, dip, straight to your doorstep
This the real thing, can you feel the force yet

[Chorus: Drake]
I always wonder if you ask yourself
Is it just me?
Is it just me?
Or is this sex so good I shouldn't have to fuck for free?
Is it just me?
Yeah, is it just me?
Is this sex so good I shouldn't have to...
Would you fuck me for free?

[Outro: DJ Khaled]
Another one
They don't want me to have another anthem
So I made sure I got another anthem
It's We The Best OVO
Summers ours
It always has been
Don't ever play yourself
One time for Future the Prince
One time for 40
One time for Drake
Another one
Bless up
