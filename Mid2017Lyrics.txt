[Intro]
Are you alright?
I'm alright, I'm quite alright
And my money's right
8… (yeah)
Countin' them bands
All way to the top 'til they be fallin' over
(yeah, yeah, yeah)
Countin' them bands
On my way to the top 'til we fallin' over

[Chorus]
I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you shoulda never lied
Shoulda saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said: "Baby, I am not afraid to die."
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge

[Verse 1]
Phantom that's all red, inside all white
Like somethin' you ride a sled down, I just want that head
My Brittany got mad, I'm barely her man now
Everybody got the same swag now
Watch the way that I tear it down
Stackin' my bands all the way to the top
All the way 'til my bands fallin' over
Every time that you leave your spot
Your girlfriend call me like, "Come on over!"
I like the way that she treat me
Gon' leave you, won't leave me, I call it that Casanova
She say I'm insane, yeah
I might blow my brain out (hey)
Xanny, help the pain, yeah
Please, Xanny, make it go away
I'm committed, not addicted, but it keep control of me
All the pain, now I can't feel it
I swear that it's slowin' me, yeah

[Chorus]
I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you shoulda never lied
Saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said: "I am not afraid to die."
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge (yeah)
All my friends are dead, yeah, ooh
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead, yeah
All my friends are dead, yeah

[Verse 2]
That is not your swag, I swear you fake hard
Now these niggas wanna take my cadence
Rain on 'em, thunderstorm, rain on 'em (ooh, yeah)
Medicine, lil' nigga, take some (yeh, yeh)
Fast car, NASCAR, race on 'em
In the club, ain't got no ones, then we would beg them
Clothes from overseas, got the racks and they all C-Notes
You is not a G though
Lookin' at you stackin' all your money, it all green though
I was countin' that and these all twenties, that's a G-roll

[Bridge]
She say: "You're the worst, you're the worst."
I cannot die because this my universe

[Chorus]
I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you shoulda never lied
Shoulda saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said: "Baby, I am not afraid to die."
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge

Ain't gotta worry 'bout 'em commas 'cause my cake up
You can run inside my life from that fame bus (skrt)

Then she went and put that booty on that Gucci belt
We don't got no label
She say she want bottles, she ain't got no table
She don't got no bed frame, she don't got no tables
We just watchin' Netflix, she ain't got no cable, okay though

Lookin' for the one?
Well, bitch, you're lookin' at the one

'Cause I've been lookin' for somebody
Not just any fuckin' body
Don't make me catch a body
That's for any and everybody
Oh my God, she hit me up all day, get no response
Bitch, you blow my high
That's like turnin' gold to bronze, roll my eyes
And when she on the Molly she a zombie
She think we Clyde and Bonnie
But it's more like Whitney and Bobby
God, forgive me! Tunechi F finessin', I'm a legend
Straight up out the Crescent
Fly your bae down for the Essence
For the record I knew Khaled when that boy was spinnin' records
Mula Gang, winnin' record

Nobody pray for me

Waaaaay (yeah, yeah!)

[Verse 1]
Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I'm countin' this
Parmesan where my accountant lives; in fact, I'm downin' this
D'USSÉ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy yo' ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know

[Chorus]
Bitch, be humble (hol' up, bitch)
Sit down (hol' up, lil', hol' up, lil' bitch)
Be humble (hol' up, bitch)
Sit down (hol' up, sit down, lil', sit down, lil' bitch)

[Verse 2]
Who dat nigga thinkin' that he frontin' on Man-Man? (Man-Man)
Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)
Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
I make a play fucking up your whole life
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still will take you down right on your mama's couch in Polo socks
Ayy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy
I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy
I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy
I stay modest 'bout it, ayy, she elaborate it, ayy
This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ayy
Watch my soul speak, you let the meds talk, ayy
If I kill a nigga, it won't be the alcohol, ayy
I'm the realest nigga after all

[Chorus]
Bitch, be humble (hol' up, bitch)
Sit down (hol' up, lil', hol' up, lil' bitch)
Be humble (hol' up, bitch)
Sit down (hol' up, sit down, lil', sit down, lil' bitch)

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
It's not good enough for me
Since I've been with you, ooh
It's not gonna work for you
Nobody can equal me (I know)
I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm
While she push up against me, ooh, is she tipsy?
I had enough convo for 24
I peep'd you from across the room
Pretty little body dancin' like GoGo, hey
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone (oeh)
Why not? A fuckin' good time never hurt nobody
I got a little drink but it's not Bacardi
If you loved the girl, then I'm so, so sorry
I gotta give it to her like we in a marriage
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no, I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Feelin' like I'm fresh out; Boosie
If they want the drama, got the Uzi
Ship the whole crew to the cruise ship
Doin' shit you don't even see in movies
Ride with me, ride with me, boss
I got a hard head, but her ass soft
She want the last name with the ring on it
'Cause I pulled out a million cash, told her plank on it

[Refrain: Swae Lee & French Montana]
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Now you wanna choose
Just pop the bubbly in the 'cuzi

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
It's not good enough for me
Since I've been with you, ooh
I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm
While she push up against me, ooh, is she tipsy?
I had enough convo for 24
I peep'd you from across the room
Pretty little body dancin' like GoGo, hey
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone (oeh)
Why not? A fuckin' good time never hurt nobody
I got a little drink but it's not Bacardi
If you loved the girl, then I'm so, so sorry
I gotta give it to her like we in a marriage
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no, I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do

[Verse 2: French Montana]
You ain't enough for me
Too much for you alone
Baby, go and grab some bad bitches, bring 'em home
Know the jet's on me
I'ma curve my best for you, you know
So pick up that dress for me
Leave the rest on
Too much convo for 24 hours
When you stand next to 24 karats
She left her man at home
She don't love him no more
I want your mind and your body
Don't mind nobody
So, you don't ever hurt nobody
Baby girl, work your body, work your body

[Refrain: Swae Lee & French Montana]
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Now you wanna choose
Just pop the bubbly in the 'cuzi
Why not?

[Outro: Swae Lee]
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no, I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do

Put some spotlight on the side

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
All this jewelry ain't no use when it's this dark
It's my favorite part, we see the lights, they got so far
It went too fast, we couldn't reach it with our arms
Wrist on a wrist, a link of charms, yeah
Laying, we're still a link apart
It's like we could die here all young
Like we could dye hair all blonde
If we could see in twenty twin
Twice we could see it 'til the end

Put that spotlight on her face (spotlight)
Put that spotlight on her face (ah, yeah)

(Offset!) Good gracious
Starin' at my diamonds while I'm hoppin' out a spaceship
Need your information, take vacation to Malaysia (Info)
You my baby, the paparazzi flashin' crazy
She swallowed the bottle while I sit back and smoke gelato
Walk in my mansion, twenty thousand painting, Picasso
Bitches be dippin', dabbin' with niggas like a nacho
Took off her panties, diamonds dancin' like Rick Ricardo
She havin' it, went to college, workin' on her bachelor
I know you got a past, I got a past, that's in the back of us
Average, I'ma make a million on the average
I'm ridin' with no brain, bitch, I'm out of it

Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this? (I might)

Daylight
I wake up feeling like you won't play right
I used to know, but now that shit don't feel right
It made me put away my pride
So long
You made a nigga wait for some, so long
You make it hard for boy like that to go on
I'm wishing I could make this mine, oh

Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through (place to come through)
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you

[Verse 1]
At times I wonder why I fool with you
But this is new to me, this is new to you
Initially, I didn't wanna fall for you
Gather my attention it was all for you, so don't
Take advantage, don't leave my heart damaged
To understand that things go a little bit better when you plan it... oh

[Chorus]
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through (place to come through)
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna fall in love off of subtweets, so
Let's get personal
I got a lot of cool spots that we can go
Tell me what's the move and I got you
I'm only acting like this 'cause I like you
Just give me the vibe to slide then
Oh, I might make you mine by the night, and

[Chorus]
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through (place to come through)
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you

Ride, ride, ride, come and vibe with me tonight

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
Hey!
Well nothing ever last forever, no
One minute you're here and the next you're gone
So I respect you, wanna take it slow
I need a mental receipt to know this moment I owe

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Do you mind if I steal a kiss? (Chop, chop)
A little souvenir, can I steal it from you?
To memorize the way you shock me
The way you move it here (Hey)
Just wanna feel it from you (Hey)

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Don't be afraid to catch feels
Ride drop top and chase thrills (Hey)
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills (Hey)
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels
Feels with me

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
I'm your window shopper, sucker for your love, oh
I'm wearing your goggles, virtual reality
It ain't what it cost you, it might be a dollar
As long as it shocks you, memory, electricity

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Do you mind if I steal a kiss? (Chop, chop)
A little souvenir, can I steal it from you? (Oh, yeah)
To memorize the way you shock me (Zap)
The way you move it here (Hey)
Just wanna feel it from you (Hey)

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Don't be afraid to catch feels (Ha)
Ride drop top and chase thrills (Oh-oh-oh, oh)
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills (Hey)
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels (Straight up)
Feels with me (Woah)

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Goddamn, I know you love to make an entrance
Do you like getting paid or getting paid attention?
You mixed the wrong guys with the right intentions
In the same bed, but it still feel long distance
She's looking for a little more consistency
But when you stop looking you gon' find what's meant to be
And honestly, I'm way too done with the hoes
I cut off all my exes for your x and o's
I feel my old flings was just preparing me
When I say I want you, say it back, parakeet
Fly in first-class through the air, Airbnb
I'm the best you had, you just be comparing me to me
I'ma 'at' this at you, if I put you on my phone
And upload it, it'll get maximum views
I came through in the clutch with the lipsticks and phones
Wear your fave cologne just to get you alone

[Chorus: Katy Perry & Big Sean]
Don't be afraid to catch feels
Don't be afraid to catch these feels
Ride drop top and chase thrills (Yeah)
I know you ain't afraid about this (I know)
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels
Woah, woah, woah
Feels with me
Don't be afraid to catch feels (No, no)
Don't be afraid, baby
Ride drop top and chase thrills (Woah, okay)
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills
I know, I know, I know, I know
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels
Feels with me

You heard, spit it, yo

[Chorus]
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Rep the set, gotta rep the set
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Don't chase no bitches

[Verse 1]
Two cups, toast up with the gang
From food stamps to a whole 'nother domain
Out the bottom, I'm the livin' proof (Super)
Ain't compromising, half a million on the coupe
Drug houses, lookin' like Peru
Graduated, I was overdue
Pink molly, I can barely move
Ask about me, I'm gon' bust a move
Rick James, thirty-three chains
Ocean air, cruisin' Biscayne
Top off, that’s a liability
Hit the gas, boostin' my adrenaline

[Chorus]
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Rep the set, gotta rep the set
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Mask on, fuck it, mask off

Don't chase no bitches

[Verse 2]
Four-door Maybach, I drive anything
Buy my Range, make 'em go insane
(Oh my Lord, praise him be)
My guillotine, drank promethazine
TEC and beams, go to those extremes
Parliament, calamari Wednesday
Parlay in Vegas, we was in attendance
Before the business, Theodore lenses
Theo-Dur prescriptions, focus on the missions
Intermission, never take a break
Switch states, touch down, foreign plates
Ain't no way, ain't no fuckin' way
We call the play, we didn't come to play
Rob the bank, we gon' rob the game
They gang, we gang
But they are not the same (Freebandz)

[Chorus]
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Rep the set, gotta rep the set
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Don't chase no bitches

[Outro]
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Gas gone, never nod off
(Cold chills, prison cells)
(Oh my Lord, praise him be)



[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I got, I got, I got, I got—
Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle though, ambition, flow inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got—
Realness, I just kill shit 'cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil, that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, that's him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a—
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction, burners, boosters
Burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids and
I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier's DNA
Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn't have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I'm supposed to, antisocial, extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gonna plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar & Geraldo Rivera]
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a be-, fuck your life
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the makin' of marriages

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me somethin'
You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you're in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy and walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder — these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder — our DNA

[Video Outro]
DNA, DNA
Real nigga in my DNA
Ain't no ho inside my DNA
Drippin' gold inside my DNA
Power shows inside my DNA
DNA
Real nigga in my DNA
Ain't no ho inside my DNA



[Chorus: Khalid]
I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85
I've been thinking way too much
And I'm way too gone to drive
I've got anger in my chest
I've got millions on my mind
And you didn't fit the picture
So I guess you weren't the vibe
I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85
I've been thinking way too much
And I'm way too gone to drive
I've got anger in my chest
I've got millions on my mind
And you didn't fit the picture
So I guess you weren't the vibe

[Verse 1: Future]
Got L-O-V-E on my right leg, that's Gucci (get what I'm sayin'?)
Got L-O-V-E on my main ho, that's Pucci (get what I'm sayin'?)
Caught a lil' jetlag but I'm golden, damn
We deserve Grammys and some Oscars, damn
They deserve Whammy's, they imposters
I be rollin' with my project homies, it's a vibe
I just did some pills with the homie, it's a vibe
Bend her over, switch sides, it's a vibe, yah

[Refrain: Future]
I come through with strippers and some shottas
I gotta accept that I'm a monster
I pull up in several different options
Not all, but most of 'em came topless
I'll shatter your dreams with this cream I make (cream I make)
Gotta be on codeine to think of shit I say (shit I say)
I can't feel my toes and ain't gon' fold up (fold up)
I was in the double R when I rolled up (when I rolled up)

[Chorus: Khalid]
I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85
I've been thinking way too much
And I'm way too gone to drive
I've got anger in my chest
I've got millions on my mind
And you didn't fit the picture
So I guess you weren't the vibe
I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85
I've been thinking way too much
And I'm way too gone to drive
I've got anger in my chest
I've got millions on my mind
And you didn't fit the picture
So I guess you weren't the vibe

[Verse 2: Future]
Pluto
Gotta dig what I'm sayin', Chanel drapes on me, baby
Gotta dig what I'm sayin', she look like she's sponsored by Mercedes
Dig what I'm sayin', this Creed cologne is on me, baby (you dig?)
Dig what I'm sayin'? I'm goin' hard (hard, yeah)
I pop bubbly in your memory
You should be glad I'm showin' you sympathy (showin' you sympathy)
I gave you real love out the gutter (out the gutter)
Ever let you go, you gon' suffer (you gon' suffer from it)

[Refrain: Future]
I come through with strippers and some shottas (shottas)
I gotta accept that I'm a monster
I pull up in several different options
Not all, but most of 'em came topless
I'll shatter your dreams with this cream I make (cream I make)
Gotta be on codeine to think of shit I say (shit I say)
I can't feel my toes and ain't gon' fold up (fold up)
I was in the double R when I rolled up (when I rolled up)

[Outro: Khalid & Future]
Yeah, L-O-V-E on my right leg
Nah Hendrix overload, dig what I'm sayin'?
I feel like I should be giving up
You can leave if it's too much
But I'm tired of you leading me on, oh no
I don't like where this shit is going
I've been stuck in all your apologies
Gave my all but you want more from me
Keep your love, it doesn't feel the same
I hope it hurts you when you're hearin' my name



[Verse 1]
Got a girl from the south side, got braids in her hair
First time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell off my chair
Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats

[Chorus]
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

[Verse 2]
The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt
But I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help
Got hips like honey, so thick and so sweet
It ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets

[Chorus]
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

[Bridge]
We're out here in the boondocks
With the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass
With my lips on hers
On the highway to heaven
Headed south of her smile
Get there when we get there
Every inch is a mile

[Chorus]
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

[Outro]
I'ma take it slow
As fast as I can
Body like a back road
Drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand



[Verse 1]
First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh
Second things second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look to me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

[Chorus]
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

[Verse 2]
Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I was choking in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down
And rained down, like...

[Chorus]
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

[Bridge]
Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flame
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down
And rained down, like...

[Chorus]
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
(Who can relate? Woo!)
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Logic]
I don't wanna be alive
I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die today
I just wanna die
I don't wanna be alive
I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die
And let me tell you why

[Verse 1: Logic]
All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it
I know I'm hurting deep down but can't show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?
They say every life precious but nobody care about mine

[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
(Who can relate? Woo!)
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Logic]
I want you to be alive
I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die today
You don't gotta die
I want you to be alive
I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die
Now lemme tell you why

[Verse 2: Alessia Cara]
It's the very first breath
When your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air
When you're there
Chest to chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long
And seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection
Finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

[Verse 3: Logic]
I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
(Who can relate? Woo!)
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Logic]
I finally wanna be alive
I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die today

[Outro: Khalid]
Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow
But I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry anymore
I wanna feel alive
I don't even wanna die anymore
Oh I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't even wanna die anymore



[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
No limit in the sky
That I won't fly for ya
No amount of tears in my eyes
That I won't cry for ya, oh no
With every breath that I take
I want you to share that air with me
There's no promise that I won't keep
I'll climb a mountain, there's none too steep

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
When it comes to you, there's no crime
Let's take both of our souls, and intertwine
When it comes to you, don't be blind
Watch me speak from my heart
When it comes to you, comes to you

[Post-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Want you to share that
(When it comes to you)

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Cupid ain't a lie
Arrow got your name on it, oh yeah
Don't miss out on a love
And regret yourself on it, oh
Open up your mind, clear your head
Ain't gotta wake up to an empty bed
Share my life, it's yours to keep
Now that I give to you all of me, oh

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
When it comes to you, there's no crime
Let's take both of our souls, and intertwine
When it comes to you, don't be blind

Want you to share that
(Share) When it comes to you
Want you to share that

When it comes to you, don't be blind
Watch me speak from my heart
When it comes to you, comes to you

You got issues that I won't mention for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart

[Chorus]
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways

Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no

[Verse 2]
Listen
Harder buildin' trust from a distance
I think we should rule out commitment for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart
Leavin'
You're just doing that to get even
Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now
They keep fallin' apart

[Chorus]
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no

Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no

[Verse 1]
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

[Verse 2]
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

[Bridge]
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you



[Verse 1]
Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my old life behind
Not a yes sir, not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

[Chorus]
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, thunder
Thunder

[Verse 2]
Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say you're basic, they say you're easy
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage
While you were clapping in the nose bleeds

[Chorus]
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder

[Bridge]
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder, thunder

[Chorus]
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder, thunder



[Verse 1]
I don't wanna fight right now
Know you always right, now
Know I need you 'round with me
But nobody waitin' 'round with me
Been through the ups
Yeah the ups and the downs with me
Got a whole lot of love
But you don't wanna spread it 'round with me, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Never pick up, never call me
You know we're runnin' out of time
Never pick up when you want me
Now I gotta draw a line
Baby I done done enough talking
Need to know that you're mine
Baby we done done enough talking
Gotta be right now, right now

[Chorus]
Baby gon' love me now, now, now, now, now, now
Now or never, hey, hey, hey
I want you to hold me down, down, down, down, down, down
Down forever, hey, hey, hey
Said you know I wanna keep you around
'Round forever, hey, hey, hey
I want you to love me now, now, now, now, now, now
Now or never

[Verse 2]
I'm turnin' off the light right now
I'm callin' it a night now
Wishin' you were 'round with me
But you're in a different town than me
We've been through it all
But you could never spit it out for me
Tryna talk to a wall
But you could never tear it down for me, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Never pick up, never call me
You know we're runnin' out of time
Never pick up when you want me
Now I gotta draw a line
Baby I done done enough talking
Need to know that you're mine
Baby we done done enough talking
Gotta be right now, right now

[Chorus]
Baby gon' love me now, now, now, now, now, now
Now or never, hey, hey, hey
I want you to hold me down, down, down, down, down, down
Down forever, hey, hey, hey
Said you know I wanna keep you around
'Round forever, hey, hey, hey
I want you to love me now, now, now, now, now, now
Now or never

[Bridge]
Yeah, draw the line up
Don't take no more time up, yeah
Make your mind up
I need you to make your mind up, yeah
Draw the line up
Don't take no more time up, yeah
Baby you gotta decide something
Let me know

[Chorus]
Baby gon' love me now, now, now, now, now, now
Now or never, hey, hey, hey
I want you to hold me down, down, down, down, down, down
Down forever, hey, hey, hey
Said you know I wanna keep you around
'Round forever, hey, hey, hey
I want you to love me now, now, now, now, now, now
Now or never



[Intro: Kyle + Lil Yachty]
Man, fuck
What's wrong Kyle?
Man, these kids, man, talkin' shit, makin' me feel bad
Man, fuck them kids, bro! Look around, bro, look at life
Man, you're right
Mmm, you see? You see these fine bitches over here?
Yeah, woah…
You see these trees man? You see this water?
I guess it is okay
Come on, man, you got so much more to appreciate, man
Man you know what, y-you're right…
You damn right I'm right, I can't remember a time I was god-damn wrong
Man, thanks, Lil' Boat
Hey man, that's what I'm here for

[Verse 1: Kyle]
I ain't been gettin' high...
Well maybe a little, baby, I don't wanna lie
I know when you text me, girl, I don't always reply
Well you're not an angel either, you can't even fly
I notice, you think that you know shit
All this shade that's comin' at me, I wonder who throws it
They can't see the vision, boy they must be out of focus
That's a real hot album homie, I wonder who wrote it, oh shit
Otay, pray them niggas go away
Always hella clowns around it look like Cirque Du Soleil
This is not the album either, these are just the throwaways
This shit still so cold when it drop, it's gonna be a mothafuckin' snow day
Ayy, boy is good and he knows it, he don't say it, he shows it
I'm just like DeRozan, if I shoot it, it goes in
I am in Cali just coastin', get 'em so wet they need coasters
I got a selfie with Oprah, I just ain't never post it
And I'm in my happy place posted, I ain't frown since '06
I ain't cried since '01, my pad like Six Flags and your house is no fun
You can come back to mine though, your friend ain't cute but it's fine though
We gon' end on a high note

[Chorus: Kyle]
I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind
Oh, I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind

[Refrain: Kyle]
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I...

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
She said she 21, I might have to I.D. that
All my bitches come in pairs like balls in my nutsack
I remember ridin' around the city in a Hatchback
Lookin' for a problem with my young goblins
I'ma send a model home with her neck throbbin'
I done made so much money that it's non-stoppin'
Got my brothers on my back like the last name
I remember tellin' everyone I couldn't be tamed
Woah, six months later I had snapped and now I'm in the game
Went from fake chains to diamonds in another lane
Went from "Can you take me here?" to screening out the lane
Went from "Damn this nigga lame" to remember my name
So I remember all the people who ain't fucked with me
They went to college, now all them niggas is history
Upgraded from gold to diamonds in my teeth
Riding deep in the van, like we lookin' for a mystery (Raggy!)
So don't fuck with me
No, lately I been livin' like luxury
Boat and Kyle stick together like piano keys
And on my mother's mother I won't fuck a bitch without a damn rubber

[Chorus: Kyle]
I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind
Oh, I...I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind

[Refrain: Kyle]
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I...



[Verse 1]
I was walking down the street the other day
Tryna distract myself
But then I see your face
Oh wait, that's someone else
Tryna play it coy
Tryna make it disappear
But just like the battle of Troy
There's nothing subtle here
In my room there's a king size space
Bigger than it used to be
If you want you can rent that place
Call me an amenity
Even if it's in my dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh you're taking up a fraction of my mind
Ooooh every time I watch you serpentine

[Chorus]
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'

Not to give in to you
No, no, no, no
Not to give in to you
No, no, no, no

[Post-Chorus]
With my feelings on fire
Guess I'm a bad liar

[Verse 2]
I see how your attention builds
It's like looking in a mirror
Your touch like a happy pill
But still all we do is fear
What could possibly happen next?
Can we focus on the love?
Paint my kiss across your chest
If you're the art, I'll be the brush

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh you're taking up a fraction of my mind
Ooooh every time I watch you serpentine

[Chorus]
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Not to think about you
No, no, no, no
Not to think about you
No, no, no, no
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Not to give in to you
No, no, no, no
Not to give in to you
No, no, no, no

[Post-Chorus]
With my feelings on fire
Guess I'm a bad liar

[Bridge]
And oh baby let's make reality, actuality, a reality
Oh baby let's make reality, actuality, a reality

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Not to think about you

[Post-Chorus]
With my feelings on fire
Guess I'm a bad liar

Yeah, yeah, yeah
M-M-M-Murda
Yeah, yeah
Damn right, bro

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
4 AM, I'm just gettin' started
For my birthday I threw me a surprise party
Reminiscin' 'bout the trap, playin' the first Carter
My life changed when I had my first daughter
Got my first quarter flippin' fifty-dollar slabs
Your nigga's lookin' at the bills, askin' you for half
Cut from a different cloth, take pride in results
Anytime she wanna dip I'm providin' the sauce
You on side of the boss, so you kind of the boss
You keep playin' with me, I end up signing your boss
Drop an EP on a nigga for the free-free on a nigga
Yeah you ZZ on a nigga, king like BB on you niggas
Rock with Champagne P
If it wasn't for the struggle then I wouldn't be me
Call me Deuce or Dos, anything but broke
Got my aim from the scope, got the game by the throat, damn!

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Okay, you popped up on me by surprise (yeah, yeah)
You see I never took you for the poppin' type (straight up)
Damn, it's 4 AM so please believe the hype (it's lit)
Hit the lights (yeah), I'm way over top
Pop it, flick it
Drop a pin, send a location (skrrt, skrrt)
I'ma pull up in that bullet-coupe spaceship (skrrt, skrrt)
Drop off a bag of some dangerous (yeah)
I'ma hit you, 4 AM, see if you make it (yeah)

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I dropped ColleGrove out the sky, ooh
In a group with the best rapper that's alive, ooh
Never turn my back on my slime, ooh
I ain't wanna fuck the bitch but she was fine, ooh
Hold up baby, let me take my time, ooh
Hard to get some head and try to drive, ooh
Jumpin' out the cake and that's surprisin', ooh
Pickin' up the duffel bag like exercisin', ooh
Bought mama new house 'cause she deserve it, ooh
Practice makes perfect but nobody's perfect, ooh
Escobar is not open for service, ooh
Send you to Dr. Miami for your surgery, ooh

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Okay, you popped up on me by surprise (yeah, yeah)
You see I never took you for the poppin' type (straight up)

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz & Travis Scott]
Ooh, Riccardo Tisci on the crewneck
Ooh, On a killin' rapper spree and nigga, you next
Ooh, they talkin', chillin', watchin' Netflix (straight up)
Ooh, I used to trap and watch bootlegs
Ooh, I'm on my wave like a durag
Ooh, I see your boo, now where your crew at?
Ooh, talkin' tequila for the pipe-up
Ooh, I hope you got a clean vagina, yeah
Drench god, drench god, really
Representin', we the squad, really (oh, yeah)

Had to use my jeweler for a reference
Might buy a charm with the extras
Might use her legs for a necklace

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Okay, you popped up on me by surprise (yeah, yeah)
You see I never took you for the poppin' type (straight up)
Damn, it's 4 AM so please believe the hype (it's lit)

Drop off a bag of some dangerous (yeah)
I'ma hit you, 4 AM, see if you make it (yeah)

[Outro]
Don't stop trappin', boy
Got 'bout twelve racks this mornin'
Got 'bout twelve racks
Started last night, still goin'
Twelve racks strong
Got the pitbull in the corner, she pregnant
Got the crackhead in the corner, she pregnant
Everybody in here pregnant, 'cept my partner and them
But we gettin' this money though, I'm tellin' you that



[Verse 1]
We should take this back to my place
That's what she said right to my face
'Cause I want you bad
Yeah, I want you, baby
I've been thinkin' 'bout it all day
And I hope you feel the same way, yeah
'Cause I want you bad
Yeah, I want you, baby

[Chorus]
Slow, slow hands
Like sweat drippin' down our dirty laundry
No, no chance

Slow hands (woo)
Slow hands

Yeah, I already know that there ain't no stoppin'
Your plans and those
Slow hands (woo)

[Bridge]
Fingertips puttin' on a show
Got me now and I can't say no
Wanna be with you all alone
Take me home, take me home
Fingertips puttin' on a show
Can't you tell that I want you, baby, yeah

[Chorus]
[Chorus]
Slow, slow hands
Like sweat drippin' down our dirty laundry
No, no chance

Woo, slow hands



[Verse 1]
I wanna follow where she goes
I think about her and she knows it
I wanna let her take control
'Cause everytime that she gets close, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
She pulls me in enough to keep me guessing
And maybe I should stop and start confessing
Confessing, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
There's nothing holding me back
There's nothing holding me back

[Verse 2]
She says that she's never afraid
Just picture everybody naked
She really doesn't like to wait
Not really into hesitation

[Pre-Chorus]
Pulls me in enough to keep me guessing
And maybe I should stop and start confessing
Confessing, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, I've been shaking

You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
There's nothing holding me back

[Bridge]
'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
I know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright
If you were by my side and we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright
'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
I know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright
If you were by my side and we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright

[Chorus]
Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions

There's nothing holding me back
I feel so free when you're with me, baby
Baby, there's nothing holding me back

Letra de "Despacito" ft. Daddy Yankee[Translation]

[Intro: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
Ay, ¡Fonsi! ¡D.Y.!
Ohhh, oh, no, oh, no, oh
Hey, yeah!
Dididiri Daddy, go!

[Intro: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
Sí, sabes que ya llevo un rato mirándote
Tengo que bailar contigo hoy
(¡D.Y.!) Vi que tu mirada ya estaba llamándome
Muéstrame el camino que yo voy

[Verso 1: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
¡Oh!
Tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Sólo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (oh, yeah!)
Ya, ya me está gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro

[Coro: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
(Sube, sube, sube, sube, sube)

[Pos-Coro: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
Quiero ver bailar tu pelo, quiero ser tu ritmo (whoa, whoa)
Que le enseñes a mi boca (woah, woah)
Tus lugares favoritos (favorito, favorito, baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro (whoa, whoa)
Hasta provocar tus gritos (whoa, whoa)
Y que olvides tu apellido

[Verso 2: Daddy Yankee]
Si te pido un beso, ven, dámelo, yo sé que estás pensándolo
Llevo tiempo intentándolo, mami, esto es dando y dándolo
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bang-bang
Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bang-bang
Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empecemos lento, después salvaje

[Pre-Coro: Daddy Yankee]
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas
Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza
¡Oye!

[Coro: Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee]
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
(Sube, sube, sube, sube, sube)

[Pos-Coro: Luis Fonsi , Daddy Yankee]
Quiero ver bailar tu pelo, quiero ser tu ritmo (whoa, whoa)
Que le enseñes a mi boca (whoa, whoa)
Tus lugares favoritos (favorito, favorito, baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro (whoa, whoa)
Hasta provocar tus gritos (whoa, whoa)
Y que olvides tu apellido

[Verso 3: Luis Fonsi]
Despacito
Vamo' a hacerlo en una playa en Puerto Rico
Hasta que las olas griten "¡Ay, Bendito!"
Para que mi sello se quede contigo
¡Bailalo!

[Outro: Daddy Yankee & Luis Fonsi]
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Que le enseñes a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos
(Favorito, favorito, baby)
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Hasta provocar tus gritos (Fonsi)
Y que olvides tu apellido (D.Y.)
Des-pa-cito



[Intro: Drake]
Murda on the beat so it's not nice
Yeah
It’s a Habibis ting, ya?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, my side girl got a 5S with the screen cracked
Still hit me back right away, better not never hesitate
Don't come around thinkin' you gettin' saved
Tryna show the dogs brighter days
Got a torch, tryna light the way
Bitin' everybody, which is ironic
'Cause your next album probably won't ever see the light of day
Had fans, but you let 'em down
But I guess that's how you niggas gettin' down
I'm so high up I'm like, "How is niggas really gettin' down?"
I could never have a kid, then be out here still kiddin' round
Boys playin' around, where you really wanna take it now?
I got a 150,000 dollars for an afterparty
And I gave it to the killas just to break it down
Bring us up, I never take us down
But if you bring me up, then they might take you down
Fake fucked with me back then
But it's gettin' hard for you to fake it now
Fuck bein' rich when I'm forty, man, I'm tryna make it now

[Hook: Quavo]
Hell nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Park the Benz just to the ride the Wraith
Skrrt skrrt
Ten million dollars, gotta hide the safe
Skrrt skrrt, oh
Michael Phelps with the swim moves
Skrrt skrrt, oh
Michael Jordan with the tennis shoes
Skrrt skrrt

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Quavo, young nigga, I invented you (ugh)
Ike Turner with the left hand (Ike)
Griselda Blanco with the trap moves
Gangland with the right hand
Undertaker with the tattoos
Never listen to the class rules
Switch it up, they bit the last move (let's go!)
I'm a magnet for bad bitches
You got the goin' out sad bitches
I spent a fifty on the chain (racks)
You spent your last fifty (ugh, cash)
I got the keys to the streets
You got the key to defeat
I got the keys to the warzone (brrrapt!)
You got the key to the peace (ugh)

[Hook: Quavo]
Hell nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Park the Benz just to ride the Wraith
Skrrt skrrt
Ten million dollars, gotta hide the safe

[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
We gon' go live, we gon' go live, yep
We gon' go live, we gon' go live, yep
Gettin' loose off the Henny, 'Roc and a hint of Goose
Ocean deep in my swimmin' pool
Throwin' Dead Prez in my livin' room
Takin' shots, feelin' bulletproof
Flood my Rollie, told my bitch: "Let's go snorkelin'!"
Out in Portland, tryna get in her organs
No, I did not sign with Jay
But I still send a Tidal wave
Yeah, I might just go get the fade
Buy the du-rag and just tie the waves
Yeah, it's lit at the crib, you could stay
Me and Drake kick like Kid N' Play
The way that she servin' that cake
I gotta sit back and digest
I guess, for the fuck-shit I'm biased
I mix, double the cup when I stress
Got my momma out the basement
That's a different type of face lift
Free Max B out the bracelets
Don't hit us askin' what the wave is

[Hook: Quavo]
Hell nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Park the Benz just to the ride the Wraith
Skrrt skrrt
Ten million dollars, gotta hide the safe
Skrrt skrrt, oh
Michael Phelps with the swim moves
Skrrt skrrt, oh
Michael Jordan with the tennis shoes
Skrrt skrrt, oh
Michael Phelps with the swim moves
Skrrt skrrt, oh
Michael Jordan with the tennis shoes



[Intro: Mr. Talkbox]

[Pre-Chorus: DJ Dahi & Kendrick Lamar]
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired, fire)
All I want tonight is just get high (high, high, high)
Girl, you look so good, it's to die for (die for)
Ooh, that pussy good, it's to die for (on fire)

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar & Rihanna]
It's a secret society
All we ask is trust (all we ask is trust)
All we got is us
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Kung Fu Kenny now
My resume is real enough for two millenniums
A better way to make a wave, stop defendin' them
I meditate and moderate all of my wins again
I'm hangin' on the fence again
I'm always on your mind
I put my lyric and my lifeline on the line
And ain't no limit when I might shine, might grind
You rollin' with it at the right time, right now
(Only for the dollar sign)

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Bad girl RiRi now
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, leave it now
On your pulse like it's EDM
Gas in the bitch like it's premium
Haul ass on a bitch all in the fast lane
Been a bad bitch way before any cash came
I'm established, hundred carats on my name
Run the atlas, I'm a natural, I'm alright

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Rihanna]
I'm a savage, I'm a asshole, I'm a king
Shimmy ya, shimmy ya, shimmy ya rah (yeah)
You can tell your nigga he can meet me outside (yeah)
You can babysit him when I leave him outside
Ain't no other love like the one I know
I done been down so long lost hope
I done came down so hard I slowed
Honestly forever, all a real nigga want

[Pre-Chorus: DJ Dahi & Kendrick Lamar]
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired, fire)
All I want tonight is just to get high up (yeah)
All I want is, all I want is

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar & Rihanna]
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
10-4, no switchin' sides
Feel somethin' wrong
You actin' shifty, you don't ride
With me no more, I need
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it money? Is it fame? Is it weed? Is it drink?
Is it comin' down with the loud pipes and the rain?
Big chillin', only for the power in your name
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it love for the streets when the lights get dark?
Is it unconditional when the 'Rari don't start?
Tell me when your loyalty is comin' from the heart

[Verse 5: Rihanna & Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me who you loyal to
Do it start with your woman or your man? (Mmm)
Do it end with your family and friends? (Mmm)
How you loyal to yourself in advance?
I said, tell me who you loyal to
Is it anybody that you would lie for?
Anybody you would slide for?
Anybody you would die for?
That's what God for

[Pre-Chorus: DJ Dahi]
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired, fire)
All I want tonight is just to get high up
(All I want is, all I want is)

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar & Rihanna]
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
10-4, no switchin' sides
Feel somethin' wrong
You actin' shifty, you don't ride
With me no more, I need
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

[Outro: Rihanna]
It's so hard to be humble
It's so hard to be
Lord knows I'm tryin'
Lord knows I'm dyin', baby

[Hook]
Lil Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in the penitentiary

Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
They sendin' all my homies on a mission
And I ain't tryna miss out on these millions

[Verse 1]
I jumped up out the Wraith, Kodak bought a Wraith
I get any girl I want, any girl I want
She want me to save the day, but I ain't got a cape
She wanna see me every day, she wanna be my bae
That money make me cum, it make me fornicate
Uh, I'm the shit, I need some toilet paper
Follow my player rules, then we gon' be okay
On the real I need a bih' who gon' cooperate

[Hook]
Lil Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'

[Verse 2]
I told you niggas I'm gon' be that fuckin' nigga
Everything be good 'til you doin' better than 'em
They wanna see a nigga shot or see me in the system
All you niggas out here poison like snake venom
Codeine in my liver, rockin' Balenciaga denim
I'm booted even when I'm sober, I don't need a jigga
They sendin' all my niggas on a fuckin' journey
I told that baby to come over 'cause I'm fuckin' horny
My mama told me: "Kill these niggas, son, keep it goin'!"
I'm thug to the bone, but I'm still her baby boy
Lil Kodak, boy they hate to see you in a foreign
They miss when you was in that 'Yota kickin' door

[Verse 1]
I'm jealous, I'm overzealous
When I'm down I get real down
When I'm high I don't come down
But I get angry, baby, believe me
I could love you just like that
And I can leave you just as fast

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But you don't judge me
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too
No, you don't judge me
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too

[Chorus]
'Cause I got issues, but you got 'em too
So give 'em all to me and I'll give mine to you
Bask in the glory, of all our problems
'Cause we got the kind of love it takes to solve 'em
Yeah, I got issues
And one of them is how bad I need you

[Verse 2]
You do shit on purpose
You get mad and you break things
Feel bad, try to fix things
But you're perfect, poorly wired circuit
And got hands like an ocean
Push you out, pull you back in

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause you don't judge me
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too
No, you don't judge me
'Cause you see it from the same point of view

[Chorus]
'Cause I got issues, but you got 'em too
So give 'em all to me and I'll give mine to you
Bask in the glory, of all our problems
'Cause we got the kind of love it takes to solve 'em
Yeah, I got issues
And one of them is how bad I need you

[Bridge]
I got issues, you got 'em too
And one of them is how bad I need you
I got issues, you got 'em too

[Chorus]
'Cause I got issues, but you got 'em too
So give 'em all to me and I'll give mine to you
Bask in the glory, of all our problems
'Cause we got the kind of love it takes to solve 'em
Yeah, I got issues (I got)
And one of them is how bad I need you (You got 'em too)
Yeah, I got issues (I got issues)
And one of them is how bad I need you (You got 'em too)
Yeah, I got issues (I got)
And one of them is how bad I need you



[Intro: Future]
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon shoot you

[Hook: Big Sean]
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Don’t owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me 'cause I'm homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me ‘lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like a edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I’m never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out 'cause I’m enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time, mane
(Thank you God, God bless you, thank you so much)

[Hook: Big Sean]
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Look, I woke up in beast mode
With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though
(Never sold my soul, never will never have)
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory, I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything except worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I’m on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I’m Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga, I don’t act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga, I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot “count to ten” me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen court rooms and court sides, ain’t too many seen both sides
Nigga, fuck what you know
Nigga, I’m takin' back control
The underdog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off, so

[Hook: Big Sean]
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Outro: Kanye West & Big Sean]
Bounce back, bounce, bounce
Bounce back, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bitch, bounce (Yeah)
Is you a real one?
Is you a real one?
Real one
Real one
Is you a real one?
Real one
Real one
Don



[Verse 1]
I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here, and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free, as birds catchin' the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand

[Chorus]
But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you

[Verse 2]
We watched the sun go down as we were walkin'
I'd spent the rest of my life just standing here talkin'
You would explain the current, as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us, just for a while
Do they even exist?
That's when I make the wish, to swim away with the fish
Cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song

[Chorus]
But here I am, next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you
Next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you

[Outro]
We are just like the waves that flow back and forth
Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning
And you're there to save me
And I wanna thank you with all of my heart
It's a brand new start
A dream come true in Malibu



[Chorus: Quavo]

Bitches call me papi, 'sace that's my hobby ('sace)

Space coupe, Quavo Yoda, pourin' drank in sodas

[Verse 3: Offset]
I get high on my own, sir, heard you gon' clone, sir
Stop all that flexin', young nigga don't wanna go there
Never been a gopher, but I always been a soldier
Young niggas in the cut, posted like a vulture
Divin' off the stage in the crowd, it's a mosh pit
Yeah, shawty bad, but she broke 'cause she don't own shit
Mama asked me, "Son, when the trappin' gon' quit?"
I been ridin' round through the city in my new bitch

[Verse 1]
You think that you'll die without him
You know, that's a lie that you tell yourself
You fear that you lay alone forever now
It ain't true, ain't true, ain't true, no

[Pre-Chorus]
So put your arms around me tonight
Let the music lift you up
Like you've never been so high
Open up your heart to me
Let the music lift you up
Like you've never been this free
'Til you feel the sunrise
Let the music warm your body
Like the heat of a thousand fires
The heat of a thousand fires

[Chorus]
Ain't no crying in the club (hey, hey)
Let the beat carry, your tears as they fall, baby
Ain't no crying in the club (hey, hey)
With a little faith, your tears turn to ecstasy
Ain't no crying in the club
I won't, I won't, I...
Ain't no crying in the club
I won't, I won't, I...
Ain't no crying in the club

[Verse 2]
You may think that you'll die without her
But you know, that's a lie that you told yourself
You fear that you'll never meet another so pure
It ain't true, ain't true, ain't true, no

[Pre-Chorus]
So put your arms around me tonight
Let the music lift you up
Like you've never been so high
Open up your heart to me
Let the music lift you up

'Til you feel the sunrise
Let the music warm your body
Like the heat of a thousand fires
The heat of a thousand fires

Ain't no crying in the club
I won't, I won't, I...
Ain't no crying in the club

Ain't no crying...
Ain't no crying in the club, no crying...
I said ain't no... (ain't no...)
Ain't no crying...
Ain't no crying in the club, no crying...

[Chorus]
Ain't no crying in the club (hey, hey)
Let the beat carry, your tears as they fall, baby

To be drunk and in love in New York City
Midnight into morning coffee, burning through the hours talking

[Verse 1: Andrew Taggart]
Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much
And that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends
It was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

[Pre-Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

[Post-Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

[Verse 2: Halsey]
You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that Blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no call
Now I'm lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Halsey]
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

[Post-Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Halsey]
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Halsey]
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

[Post-Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Halsey]
We ain't ever getting older
(No, we ain't ever getting older)
We ain't ever getting older
(No, we ain't ever getting older)
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
(No, we ain't ever getting older)

I don't do it for the 'Gram, I do it for Compton
I'm willin' to die for this shit, nigga
I'll take your fuckin' life for this shit, nigga

None of y'all fuckin' with the flow yeah, the flow yeah

Niggas thought they wasn't gonna see me, huh?
Niggas thought that K-Dot real life
Was the same life they see on TV, huh?
Niggas wanna flex on me and be in L.A. for free, huh?
Next time they hit the 10 freeway, we need a receipt, huh?
'Cause most of y'all ain't real
Most of y'all gon' squeal
Most of y'all just envy, but jealousy get you killed
Most of y'all throw rocks and try to hide your hand
Just say his name and I promise that you'll see Candyman
Because it's all in your eyes, most of y'all tell lies
Most of y'all don't fade, most of y'all been advised
Last LP I tried to lift the black artists
But it's a difference between black artists and wack artists

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar & Kid Capri]
If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
It's the one and only, the world's greatest, the Kid Capri
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy

They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element

[Verse 1: Thomas Rhett]
Every time we have to say goodbye
I'm counting down until we say hello
Every touch is like the strongest drug
I don't know how much longer I can go

[Pre-Chorus: Thomas Rhett]
I never had something that I can't walk away from
But, girl, my self-control's so paralyzed
When it comes to you, no, I ain't got no patience
There's something 'bout you girl I just can't fight

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett & Maren Morris]
You're like that cigarette
That shot of 100 proof
No matter how much I get
I'm always craving
That feeling when we kiss
The way your body moves
No matter how much I get
I'm always craving you
Craving you

All the in-between is killing me
You know I come unglued from missing you
Sunset eyes, no, I don't have to try
Because you know exactly what to do

[Pre-Chorus: Thomas Rhett & Maren Morris]
I never had something that I can't walk away from (walk away from)
But, girl, my self-control's so paralyzed

[Verse 1]
I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

[Pre-Chorus]
Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

[Chorus 1]
I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

[Verse 2]
I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

[Chorus 2]
I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

[Bridge]
I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

[Chorus 3]
I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise till death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

[Outro]
Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go



[Verse 1]
Where should we run to?
We got the world in our hands and we're ready to play
They say we're wasted
But how can we waste it if we're loving every day?
Okay, I got the keys to the universe
So stay, with me, 'cause I got the keys, babe

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna wake up one day wishing that we done more
I wanna live fast and never look back, that's what we here for
Don't wanna wake up one day wondering where'd it all go
'Cause we'll be home before we know, I wanna hear you sing it

[Chorus]
Hey mama, don't stress your mind, we coming home tonight
Hey mama, we gonna be alright, dry those eyes
We'll be back in the morning when the sun starts to rise
So mama, don't stress your mind
So mama, don't stress your mind

[Post-Chorus]
Mama, mama, mama, hey
We coming home tonight
Mama, mama, mama, hey
We coming home tonight

[Verse 2]
Where should we run to?
We got a ticket that takes us wherever we like
We got our problems
But just for the minute, let's push all our troubles aside
Alright, 'cause we got the keys to the universe
Inside our minds, yeah, we got the keys, babe

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna wake up one day wishing that we done more
I wanna live fast and never look back, that's what we here for
Don't wanna wake up one day wondering where'd it all go
'Cause we'll be home before we know, I wanna hear you sing it

[Chorus]
Hey mama, don't stress your mind, we coming home tonight
Hey mama, we gonna be alright, dry those eyes
We'll be back in the morning when the sun starts to rise
So mama, don't stress your mind
So mama, don't stress your mind
Hey, mama, don't stress your mind, we coming home tonight
Hey, mama, we gonna be alright, dry those eyes
We'll be back in the morning when the sun starts to rise

[Chorus]
Hermès link, ice-blue mink
Tat on my ribs like I do not know what permanent is
They want me gone, wait for the kicker
Bury me now and I only get bigger
That's word to my nigga

[Verse 1]
Yeah, October Firm in the cut
Stay at the top like I'm stuck
That's just how I'm givin' it up
She wanna get married tonight
But I can't take a knee, 'cause I'm wearin' all white
Me and my broski are twins, but we don't look alike
I don't take naps
Me and the money are way too attached to go and do that
Muscle relax
That and the spliff put me right on my back, I gotta unpack
Virginia Black
I could go make enough money off that and not even rap
What's that? Facts?
Contract max, I gotta bring that shit back

[Chorus]
Hermès link, ice-blue mink
Tat on my ribs like I do not know what permanent is
They want me gone, out of the picture
Bury me now and I only get bigger
That's word to my, word to my—

[Verse 2]
I'm so hot, yeah, I’m so right now
Who's not gang, bitch? Let me find out
Keep hearin' clicks when I'm talkin' on the iPhone
Feds in the city hate to see us on a high note
I switch flow like I switch time zone
Can't get Nobu, but you can get Milestone
I gotta do mansion 'cause I outgrew condo
Gotta do Maybach, she wanna fuck on the drive home
Yeah, met her once and I got through
I'm never washed, but I'm not new
I know I said top five, but I'm top two
And I'm not two and I got one
Thought you had one, but it's not one, nigga, nah

[Chorus]
Hermès link, ice-blue mink
Tat on my ribs like I do not know what permanent is
They want me gone, wait for the kicker
Bury me now and I only get bigger
That's word to my nigga



[Intro: D.R.A.M.]
Ain't no tellin' what I'm finna be on (aye, aye)
I'm beyond all that fuck shit, hey

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Hey, lil' mama, would you like to be my sunshine?
Nigga, touch my gang, we gon' turn this shit to Columbine
Ice on my neck, cost me ten times three
Thirty thousand dollars for a nigga to get flee
I just hit Rodéo, and I spent like ten Gs
I just did a show and spent the check on my mama
When I go on vacay I might rent out the Bahamas
And I keep like ten phones, damn, I'm really never home
All these niggas clones, tryna copy what I'm on
Nigga, get your own, tryna pick a nigga bone
Word to brother, Skip, boy, I had a good day
Metro PCS, trappin', boy I'm makin' plays
Fifty shades of grey, beat that pussy like Hulk Hogan
I know you know my slogan, if it ain't 'bout guap, I'm gone
Niggas hatin' 'cause I'm chosen, from the concrete I had rose
Shawty starin' at my necklace 'cause my diamonds really froze
Put that dick up in her pussy, bet she feel it in her toes
I'm a real young nigga from the six throwin' 'bows
I'm a real young nigga from the six throwin' 'bows
Real young nigga from the six throwin' 'bows

[Hook: D.R.A.M.]
In the middle of the party, bitch get off me
In the cut, I'm rollin' up my broccoli
Ya, I know your baby mama fond of me
All she want to do is smoke that broccoli
Whispered in my ear, she tryna leave with me
Said that I can get that pussy easily
Said that I can hit that shit so greasily
I'm a dirty dog, I did it sleazily

[Bridge: D.R.A.M.]
Ain't no tellin' what I'm finna be on
I'm beyond all that fuck shit
Ain't no tellin' what I'm finna be on
I'm beyond all that fuck shit

[Verse 2: D.R.A.M.]
I got companies and Pesos
I got people on my payroll
She don't do it 'less I say so
I don't smoke if it ain't fuego
I should sauce 'em up like Prego
Fettucini with Alfredo
All I wanted was the fame and every game they made on Sega
I was five or six years old when I had told myself, "Okay you're special"
But I treat you like my equal never lesser
I was twenty-six years old when we had dropped this one amazing record
Had the world steppin'
That's what I call epic
Couple summers later I got paper
I acquired taste for salmon on a bagel
With the capers on a square plate
At the restaurant with the "why you got to stare" face
To know I either ball or I record over the snare and bass
Rapper face, dread headed
Golden diamond teeth wearin'
They just mad 'cause I got that cheese, bitch, I keep dairy
Turnt up in the party, gettin' lit to Yachty
With a Spanish Barbie, word to my mami

[Hook: D.R.A.M.]
In the middle of the party, bitch get off me (Get off of me)
In the cut, I'm rollin' up my broccoli (My weed, my weed)
Ya, I know your baby mama fond of me (She fond of me)
All she want to do is smoke that broccoli
(My weed, my weed)
Whispered in my ear she trying to leave with me
(She vulnerable)
Said that I can let that pussy easily
(She fallin' for)
Said I can hit that shit so greasily (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
I'm a dirty dog I did it sleazily



[Hook]
These niggas prayed on my downfall (they what?)
These niggas prayed on my downfall
On all ten, bitch I stood tall
Show these disloyal niggas how to ball

[Verse]
Go get a thermometer for the pot, I need this shit cooked right
Let's keep that water 400 degrees Fahrenheit
You ever been inside a federal court room?
Nigga you ever went to trial and fought for your life?
Being broke did something to my spirit
Asked niggas to plug me, they act like they couldn't hear me
Look at me now, driving German engineering
You don't want your baby mama fucked, keep the ho from near me
Kilroy, 'member I used to use your L's to hit the road
Hit the O and make them big boy sales?
Moo, 'member when you had them green things mailed
With vacuum seals trying not to have them green things smelled?
Feds was on me, what you know about related through money
I don't know nothing, I just used to see 'em walk to the Coney
I fuck with bitches my body count go from Pershing to Cody
Any further questions, you can take that up with the lawyer
My nigga Fenkell, J Money, Brightmo Lo, Project Joe
Will tell you everyday before school I sold a half bow
How you think I won best dressed with no support?
And had them paid lawyers coming in and out of court
Ayy, Dwan though, ayy, Theo ain't it a blessing?
We made it out Kentucky after all that happened?
After the pre-trials, after the status
After them impact statements, after the castle
Ayy, JR nigga, ain't it a blessing?
We made it out of Lansing after all that happened?
After Michigan State, after Hubbard
When our mans told on us, them bands they took from us
Joy road bitch, but the money long as six mile
Brick mile, knock your bitch down
Pick her up, knock her back down, pull her tracks out
Yes, I slap girl, yes, I slap dog, yes, I slap loud
Yes, I'll slap a pussy nigga if he act out
Yes, I caught cases on the road with them killers
Bro, kill me if I snitch, 'cause if you snitch I'm gon' kill you
Spent a lot of time on that yard with them gorillas
Stood tall, did I let niggas hoe me? Quit being silly
I know for a fact your bitch pussy get wet for a nigga
Cause I do it better, plus I'm doing better than niggas
I'm at home when I'm down there in Lexington nigga
'Bout the king, they gone drop you and who next to you nigga
Unc said Lil T, "Get ahead of them niggas"
When you take off, don't look back and try to rescue them niggas
You killed his mans? Then make sure you get the rest of them niggas
Don't let them get the best of you, just get the revenue nigga
So let me know what you can handle, okay, come grab it
Here go some extras, so if I'm busy you can manage
Fiends had me Blade dancing, eating sixty dollar salads
Get it there and back, tell the feds I need a challenge
My first offer was 30 years, not a day lower
I told them crackers holler at me when they sober
On parole, I'm a felon, you think I ain't got that blower?
Yeah you right, bro take his head off his fucking shoulders (boom boom boom!)
You hear me? Hit the Rollie store with the Rollie on
What was our getaway car? A Jag Portfolio
You hear me? Ayy, I heard I had some sneak dissers
Whoever feeling hot, that AR got a heat sensor
'Cause said don't entertain them hungry niggas
I wish I would pay attention to these homeless niggas
Don't call my phone, I don't want to do no song with niggas
And tell yo bitch to tighten up before I bone her, nigga
I don't know you niggas, fuck wrong with niggas?
Through these white buffs I can see the hoe in niggas
Free my nigga Parico, that boy be hoeing niggas
Shoot the smile off your face, I don't joke with niggas
Boy, I can't trust you with that strap if you don't got no bodies
Boy, I can't take you on no lick if you ain't robbed nobody
You ain't no shooter, you can't do that shit without no molly
I came home and had the hoes wetter than Kalahari
Thirty months ago niggas ain't think that I was coming home
Shout out to them niggas' freaks that I been cumming on
Get em to the crib, bust em down, now bitch run along
This SK'll get to shaking like there's something wrong
Thirty bands two times, watch this money clone
The feds say my name hot like when the oven on
Bitch I came home to my lil brother gone
Niggas say they looking for me, pull up in the Skuddy zone
Who said I'm a snitch? You just heard a lie from him
Better check the black and white, that paperwork will vouch for him
Zero toleration for that nigga, take his life from him
He don't want that pistol play? Okay I'll Tyson him
I ain't hear from bitches when I had them blues on
So soon as I'm done fucking, put your shoes on
I'm on parole in two states, I can't move wrong
The feds trying to build a case, I can't move wrong
I went to trial back to back, bitch I'm 2-0
The state of Kentucky banned me from every jewelry store
Say I can't even be in public with my hoodie on
Michigan State don't want him here, they don't know what he on

[Hook]
I know they prayed on my downfall
I know they prayed on my downfall
On all ten bitch I stood tall
Show these disloyal niggas how to ball

[Verse 1]
Some girls feel best in their tiny dresses
Some girls, nothing but sweatpants, looking like a princess
Some girls kiss new lips every single night
They're staying out late cause they just celebrating life

[Pre-Chorus]
You know some days you feel so good in your own skin
But it's okay if you wanna change the body that you came in
'Cause you look greatest when you feel like a damn queen
We're all just playing a game in a way, trying to win at life

[Chorus]
Most girls are smart and strong and beautiful
Most girls work hard, go far, we are unstoppable
Most girls, our fight to make every day, no two are the same
I wanna be like, I wanna be like most girls
I wanna be like, I wanna be like most girls
I wanna be like, I wanna be like

[Post-Chorus]
They're staying out late cause they just celebrating
I wanna be like, I wanna be like
They're staying out late cause they just celebrating
I wanna be like, I wanna be like

[Verse 2]
Some girls like to keep their physique real private
Some girls wear jeans so tight 'cause it feels so right, yeah
Some girls, every day searching, keep the page turning
Sleeping in late cause they just celebrating life

[Pre-Chorus]
You know some days you feel so good in your own skin
But it's okay if you wanna change the body that you came in
'Cause you look greatest when you feel like a damn queen
We're all just playing a game in a way, trying to win at life

[Chorus]
Most girls are smart and strong and beautiful
Most girls work hard, go far, we are unstoppable
Most girls, our fight to make every day, no two are the same

[Verse 1]
Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling it's vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a race horse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Verse 2]
Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a race horse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Bridge]
Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily and
Leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes



[Verse 1]
I'm tryna put you in the worst mood, ah
P1 cleaner than your church shoes, ah
Milli point two just to hurt you, ah
All red Lamb’ just to tease you, ah
None of these toys on lease too, ah
Made your whole year in a week too, yah
Main bitch out your league too, ah
Side bitch out of your league too, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
House so empty, need a centerpiece
20 racks a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face man I love my baby
You talking money, need a hearing aid
You talking bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain

[Chorus]
Look what you've done
I’m a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy

[Verse 2]
Every day a nigga try to test me, ah
Every day a nigga try to end me, ah
Pull off in that Roadster SV, ah
Pockets overweight, gettin' hefty, ah
Coming for the king, that's a far cry, ah
I come alive in the fall time, I
No competition, I don't really listen
I’m in the blue Mulsanne bumping New Edition

[Pre-Chorus]
House so empty, need a centerpiece
20 racks a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face man I love my baby
You talking money, need a hearing aid
You talking bout me, I don’t see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain

[Chorus]
Look what you've done
I’m a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin’ starboy

[Verse 3]
Let a nigga brag Pitt
Legend of the fall took the year like a bandit
Bought mama a crib and a brand new wagon
Now she hit the grocery shop looking lavish
Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan
Girls get loose when they hear this song
100 on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars

[Pre-Chorus]
House so empty, need a centerpiece
20 racks a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face man I love my baby
You talking money, need a hearing aid
You talking 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain

[Chorus]
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy



[Intro: Kyla]
Baby, I like your style

[Verse 1: Drake]
Grips on your waist, front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe but I never run away
Even when I'm away
Oti, oti
There's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray

[Chorus: Drake]
That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

[Refrain: Kyla]
Baby, I like your style

[Verse 2: Drake]
Strength and guidance
All that I'm wishing for my friends
Nobody makes it from my ends
I had to bust up the silence
You know you gotta stick by me
Soon as you see the text, reply me
I don't wanna spend time fighting
We've got no time

[Chorus: Drake]
And that's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

[Bridge: Wizkid]
Got a pretty girl and she love me long time
Wine it, wine it, very long time
Oh yeah, very long time
Back up, back up, back up and wine it
Back up, back up and wine it, girl
Back up, back up, back up and wine it
Oh yeah, very long time
Back, up, back up and wine it, girl

[Refrain: Kyla + Wizkid]
Tell me
I need to know, where do you wanna go?
Cause if you're down, I'll take it slow
Make you lose control
Where, where, where
Where, where, where, where
Oh yeah, very long time
Where, where, where
Back, up, back up and wine it, girl
Where, where, where, where
Cause if you're down
Back up, back up and
Cause if you're down
Back up, back up and
Cause if you're down
Back up, back up and

[Chorus: Drake]
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me



[Chorus]
I can swear, I can joke
I say what's on my mind
If I drink, if I smoke
I keep up with the guys
And you see me holding up my middlefinger to the world
Fuck your ribbons and your pearls
'Cause I'm not just a pretty girl

[Verse 1]
I'm more than just a picture
I'm a daughter and a sister
Sometimes it's hard for me to show
That I'm more than just a rumor
Or a song on your computer
There's more to me than people know

[Pre-Chorus]
Some days I'm broke, some days I'm rich
Some days I'm nice, some days I can be a bitch
Some days I'm strong, some days I quit
I don't let it show, but I've been through some shit

[Chorus]
I can swear, I can joke
I say what's on my mind
If I drink, if I smoke
I keep up with the guys
And you see me holding up my middlefinger to the world
Fuck your ribbons and your pearls
'Cause I'm not just a pretty girl

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'm not just a pretty girl
I'm more than just a number
I'm a hater, I'm a lover
Sometimes it's hard for me to show
That I'm more than just a title
Or a comment going viral
There's more to me than people know

[Pre-Chorus]
Some days I'm broke, some days I'm rich
Some days I'm nice, some days I can be a bitch
Some days I'm strong, some days I quit
I don't let it show, but I've been through some shit

[Chorus]
I can swear, I can joke
I say what's on my mind
If I drink, if I smoke
I keep up with the guys
And you see me holding up my middlefinger to the world
Fuck your ribbons and your pearls
'Cause I'm not just a pretty girl, I'm not just a pretty girl
I'm not just a pretty girl, no I'm not just a pretty girl
I can swear, I can joke
I say what's on my mind
If I drink, if I smoke
I keep up with the guys
And you see me holding up my middlefinger to the world
Fuck your ribbons and your pearls
'Cause I'm not just a pretty girl, I'm not just a pretty girl
I'm not just a pretty girl, no I'm not just a pretty girl
I'm not just a pretty girl

[Intro: Future]
Too much poppin' in my life baby, I just really need some time baby
Come and check up on my line baby, out of time baby, ah noo
Fell in love with the lifestyle, black shades, night clout
She want to fuck but she don't love me
Lifestyle, lifestyle
Strapped up but I'm iced down, all white crib with the black towel
She don't want to love me
Lifestyle, lifestyle

[Hook: Future & (YG)]
Oo oo oo oo ooh
You never really loved me (You ain't never loved me)
Ahhh, ahhh, never really loved me (You ain't never loved me)
Oo oo oo oo ooh

It's my lifestyle, it's my lifestyle

[Verse 1: Future]
Lil mama fell in love with the lifestyle
Four bad bitches on a white couch
Last night, tried to pipe down
Told her hol' up, let me put the pipe down
Touchdown, I ain't even ate yet
Serve it on a platter in a red dress
Chinchilla, turn that bitch to Mona Lisa
All she want to do is fuckin' hit the beach
Sand from her toes out the Lambo
Hit 30k golds for your sandals
30 round clip for the wrong day
Drivin' in the whip, up the wrong way

[Pre-Hook: Future]

Come through the back when I come through (back up)
Got the bag, that's a fact when I come through

Mansion in the Hills and my neighbors is so nosy
Only Maybach in Bompton so I'm sliding with the 40
Gotta keep it on me cause I iced out the Rollie
My diamonds on disco and they dancin', hokie pokie
Put my left wrist in, you see that bitch blinged out
Put my right wrist in, you see that bitch blinged out
Put 'em both together, that's 200 on me, ouch
(That's what my lifestyle about)
No, you ain't never loved me, now you want to fuck me
Gotta deal with all this fake shit
Damn I'm so lucky, come here and fuck me girl

They know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just strut
What the fuck?

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
A tiger
Don't lose no sleep
Don't need opinions
From a shellfish or a sheep
Don't you come for me
No, not today
You're calculated
I got your number
'Cause you're a joker
And I'm a courtside killer queen
And you will kiss the ring
You best believe

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
So keep calm, honey, I'ma stick around
For more than a minute, get used to it
Funny my name keeps comin' outcho mouth
'Cause I stay winning
Lay 'em up like

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket
Can't touch this
Another one in the casket

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
Your game is tired
You should retire
You're 'bout cute as
An old coupon expired
And karma's not a liar
She keeps receipts

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
So keep calm, honey, I'ma stick around
For more than a minute, get used to it
Funny my name keeps comin' outcho mouth
'Cause I stay winning
Lay 'em up like

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket
Can't touch this

They just strut
Hahaha, yo

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Pink Ferragamo sliders on deck
Silly rap beefs just get me more checks
My life is a movie, I'm never off set
Me and my amigos (no, not Offset)
Swish swish, aww I got them upset
But my shooters'll make 'em dance like dubstep
Swish, swish, aww, my haters is obsessed
'Cause I make M's, they get much less
Don't be tryna double back
I already despise you
All that fake love you showin'
Couldn't even disguise you
Ran? When? Nicki gettin' tan
Mirror mirror who's the fairest bitch in all the land?
Damn, man, this bitch is a Stan
Muah, muah, the generous queen will kiss a fan
Ass goodbye, I'ma be riding by
I'ma tell my ----- Biggz, yeah that's tha guy
A star's a star, da ha da ha
They never thought the swish god would take it this far
Get my pimp cup, this is pimp shit, baby
I only rock with Queens, so I'm makin' hits with Katy

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket
Can't touch this
Another one in the casket

Slumped over like a dead man
Red and black, 'bout my bread, man

Lace up, learn a lesson
Bitch, I'm saucin', I do this often, don't do no talkin'
My options right when I walk in, jump all them Jordans

Like I'm Davis from New Orleans
Or bitch I'm Harden, I don't miss nothin'
Fuck practice, this shit just happens, know y'all can't stand it

[Verse 1]
Hadn't had a good time
Since you know when
Got talked into going out
With hopes you were staying in
I was feeling like myself for the first time
In a long time
'Til I bumped into some of your friends
Over there talkin' to mine

[Chorus]
Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart storming
The moon went hiding, stars quit shining
Rain was dropping, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

[Verse 2]
Knew it was gonna be a long night
From the moment when
We locked eyes over whiskey on ice
Started talking 'bout us again
If I would've just laid my drink down
And walked out
I wouldn't be in my truck
Driving us to your house

[Chorus]
But you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart storming
The moon went hiding, stars quit shining
Rain was dropping, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

[Bridge]
Yeah, you hit me Category 5
With your smile
Blew me away
And girl, it ain't but midnight
You done killed the lights
Bent my heart back to your bedside

[Chorus]
Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
'Cause I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart storming
The moon went hiding, stars quit shining
Rain was dropping, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane



[Chorus]
Yah, it do not matter
Turned to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smokin' that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster
Turned to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smokin' that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster

[Verse 1]
Money so old, dollars spoiled
Yah, my lil bitch so spoiled
Yah, I rub her down in oil
Yah, I got money, now you know it
Yah, diamonds on my teeth
Yah, your shit look like foil
Yah, Chris Brown said these hoes ain't loyal
None of these hoes got no morals
All my niggas G'ed up
Yah, my glasses be Dita
Never thought it would be days I could kick my feet up
Never thought that she would need me that much if I leave her

[Chorus]
It do not matter
Turned to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smokin' that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster
Turned to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smokin' that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster
Turned to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smokin' that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster

[Verse 2]
All of this was faction
No time for actin', all this money lastin'
Like, go out to eat, get that blackened salmon
When I'm wit' my girl, we Pharrell and Vashtie
Wait... huh? That mean we are not lastin'
In that pussy, you know I like it rough then I'm just blastin'
Yah, tell that lil bitch that I'm really from Mars
Uh, yah, bitch, do not start
Yah, pull up, my car automatic
Yah, uh, dealt with the star, yah!

[Chorus]
It do not matter
Turned to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy

Birds in the trap sing Brian McKnight
Percocet and Codeine please don't take my life
She had a dream with Céline
So I bought it twice
Young nigga make it right back tonight
Girl you're so cute and your ass is nice
Drinkin' on four and I'm shootin' dice
Wrist polar bear, Klondike
And I'm loving all races, hell nah don't discriminize
Drinkin' on clean, sanitize
Ostritch seats with the frog eyes

Letra de "Felices los 4"[Intro]
Maluma baby

[Verso 1]
Apenas sale el sol y tú te vas corriendo
Sé que pensarás que esto me está doliendo
Yo no estoy pensando en lo que estás haciendo
Si somos ajenos y así nos queremos

[Estribillo 1]
Si conmigo te quedas
O con otro tú te vas
No me importa un carajo
Porque sé que volverás

Si conmigo te quedas
O con otro tú te vas
No me importa un carajo
Porque sé que volverás

[Estribillo 2]
Y si con otro pasas el rato
Vamo' a ser feliz, vamo' a ser feliz
Felices los 4
Te agrandamos el cuarto

Y si con otro pasas el rato
Vamo' a ser feliz, vamo' a ser feliz
Felices los 4
Yo te acepto el trato

[Coro]
Y lo hacemos otro rato
Y lo hacemos otro rato
Y lo hacemos otro rato
Y lo hacemos otro rato

[Verso 2]
Y lo hacemos otro rato
Lo nuestro no depende de un pacto
Disfruta y sólo siente el impacto
El boom boom que te quema, ese cuerpo de sirena
Tranquila que no creo en contratos
(Y tu menos...)

[Puente]
Y siempre que se va, regresa a mí
Y felices los 4
No importa el que dirán, nos gusta así
(Te agrandamos el cuarto, baby)
Y siempre que se va, regresa a mí
Y felices los 4
No importa el que dirán, somos tal para cual

[Estribillo 2]
Y si con otro pasas el rato
Vamo' a ser feliz, vamo' a ser feliz
Felices los 4
Te agrandamos el cuarto

Y si con otro pasas el rato
Vamo' a ser feliz, vamo' a ser feliz
Felices los 4
Yo te acepto el trato

[Coro]
Y lo hacemos otro rato
Y lo hacemos otro rato
Y lo hacemos otro rato
Y lo hacemos otro rato

[Estribillo 1]
Si conmigo te quedas
O con otro tú te vas
No me importa un carajo
Porque sé que volverás

Si conmigo te quedas
O con otro tú te vas
No me importa un carajo
Porque sé que volverás

[Estribillo 2]
Y si con otro pasas el rato
Vamo' a ser feliz, vamo' a ser feliz
Felices los 4
Te agrandamos el cuarto

Y si con otro pasas el rato
Vamo' a ser feliz, vamo' a ser feliz
Felices los 4
Yo te acepto el trato

[Coro]
Y lo hacemos otro rato
Y lo hacemos otro rato
Y lo hacemos otro rato
Y lo hacemos otro rato

[Outro]
Y siempre que se va, regresa a mí
(Maluma baby)
No importa el que dirán, nos gusta así
(Kevin ADG, Chan El Genio)
Y siempre que se va, regresa a mí
(El código secreto, baby)
No importa el que dirán, somos tal para cual
Así lo quiso el destino mami
Mua



[Verse 1]
A couple rebel top gun pilots
Flying with nowhere to be
Don't know you super well
But I think that you might be the same as me
Behave abnormally

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lies
Yeah, awesome right?
So let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lines
Seeing me rolling, showing someone else love
Dancing with our shoes off
Know I think you're awesome, right?

[Chorus]
Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite

[Verse 2]
Might get your friend to drive, but he can hardly see
We'll end up painted on the road
Red and chrome
All the broken glass sparkling
I guess we're partying

[Pre-Chorus]
So let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lies
Seeing me rolling, showing someone else love
Hands under your t-shirt
Know I think you're awesome, right?

[Chorus]
Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Now you know it's really gonna blow

Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite

[Outro]
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite



[Verse 1]
Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
Welcome to the final show
Hope you're wearing your best clothes
You can't bribe the door on your way to the sky
You look pretty good down here
But you ain't really good

[Pre-Chorus]
We never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?
We never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?

[Chorus]
Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Just stop your crying, it'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here

[Verse 2]
Just stop your crying, have the time of your life
Breaking through the atmosphere
And things are pretty good from here
Remember everything will be alright
We can meet again somewhere
Somewhere far away from here

[Pre-Chorus]
We never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?
We never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?

[Chorus]
Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Stop your crying, baby, it'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here

[Pre-Chorus]
We never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?
We never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?

[Bridge]
We don't talk enough, we should open up
Before it's all too much
Will we ever learn? We've been here before
It's just what we know

[Outro]
Stop your crying, baby, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away, we got to get away
We got to get away, we got to get away
We got to get away
We got to, we got to, away
We got to, we got to, away
We got to, we got to, away



[Verse 1]
I woke up with a fear this morning
But I can taste you on the tip of my tongue
Alarm without no warning
You’re by my side and we’ve got smoke in our lungs

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Last night we were way up, kissing in the back of the cab
And then you say, “Love, baby, let’s go back to my flat”
And when we wake up, never had a feeling like that
I got a reason, so man, put that record on again

[Chorus]
I don’t wanna hear sad songs anymore
I only wanna hear love songs
I found my heart up in this place tonight
Don’t wanna sing mad songs anymore
Only wanna sing your song
’Cause your song’s got me feeling like I’m

[Post-Chorus]
I’m in love, I’m in love, I’m in love
Yeah, you know, your song’s got me feeling like I’m

[Verse 2]
No fear but I think I’m falling, I’m not proud
But I’m usually the type of girl that would hit and run
No risk so I think I’m all-in
When I kiss your lips, feel my heartbeat thump

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And now we’re way up, dancing on the roof of the house
And then we make love, right there on your best friend’s couch
And then you say “Love, this is what it’s all about”
So keep on kissing my mouth and put that record on again

[Chorus]
I don’t wanna hear sad songs anymore
I only wanna hear love songs
I found my heart up in this place tonight
Don’t wanna sing mad songs anymore
Only wanna sing your song
’Cause your song’s got me feeling like I’m

[Post-Chorus]
I’m in love, I’m in love, I’m in love
I’m in love, I’m in love, I’m in love
I’m in love, I’m in love, I’m in love
Yeah, you know your song’s got me feeling like I’m

[Bridge]
I don’t wanna hear sad songs anymore
I only wanna hear love songs
I found my heart up in this place tonight
Don’t wanna sing mad songs anymore
Only wanna sing your song
’Cause your song’s got me feeling like I’m

[Chorus]
I don’t wanna hear sad songs anymore
I only wanna hear love songs
I found my heart up in this place tonight
Don’t wanna sing mad songs anymore
Only wanna sing your song
’Cause your song’s got me feeling like I’m

[Post-Chorus]
I’m in love, I’m in love, I’m in love
I’m in love, I’m in love, I’m in love
I’m in love, I’m in love, I’m in love
Yeah, you know your song’s got me feeling like I’m

[Hook]
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh

[Verse 1]
She's falling but she doesn't think he'll catch her
'Cause her last relationship was a disaster
Accusations everyday, she didn't know why
All her calls would be ignored, he's on his own time
Should've ended it before it started
All she ever got was broken hearted
He was cheating on her, trying to flip it back on her like a victim
Now she all alone and starting over
Now she got baggage on her shoulder
But the new guy really loves her
She loves him, but she doesn't trust herself anymore

[Hook]
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh

[Verse 2]
Despite her past, she can't help the attraction
He tells her that he's nothing like the last one
He redefines in every way what love is
She fell for him and hasn't gotten up since
Every now and then, she goes off, though
Beating on his chest like a bongo
He understands she's coming from a hurt place
Answers all the questions on her survey
Doesn't get jealous, doesn't break trust
Doesn’t call her, "Hoe" after hang-ups
Give her everything she ever wanted
And even though she still feels haunted

[Hook]
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh

[Verse 1: Kehlani]
Pray to God, but I'm feeling like he's going deaf
Now when I lean on you and I got nothing left
Hey, I've been wanting to call ya, tell you that I'm sorry
Same old fucking story everybody sing

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
And I say I'm okay, but I guess I'm a liar
You say you're okay, but I saw that you liked it
2 AM and faded, I know that's when you like it
Know that's when you miss me, know that's when you crying

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby

[Verse 2: Kehlani]
Nowadays, I'm just a bitch to everybody else
(Fuck you and you)
I don't need no shoulders, I'm good crying by myself
(Fuck you, too)
Moving on's a chore, 'cause you know I still adore ya
An unrequited love is just a lover's hell

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
And I say I'm okay, but I guess I'm a liar
You say you're okay, but I saw that you liked it
2 AM and faded, I know that's when you like it
Know that's when you miss me, know that's when you crying

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
(Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat)
I'm not gonna act like I don't love ya baby
'Cause deep in my mind, girl, I know I do (true)
Tried to search all through the world and not well
But I can't find a girl who looks close like you (no!)
I done made millions of dollars
But I'm still alone until I come home back to you (yah!)
I remember all of the times we were parked by your house
And laughed all on your avenue
Whoa, you can't front
You're a stone cold diva (yaah!)
I had to get counseling from my moms
She's a heartbreak teacher (oh, yah!)
Remember that time I put those pepperonis on your face
Made you a creature
Now I think about you every single time I eat pizza, ohh

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby

[Post-Chorus: Kehlani]
Why you holding me?
Why you holding me?

[Outro: Lil Yachty]
Oh, she killed that shit
She was killing it, that was hard, bruh
I didn't know she could get that high but she killed that
Go Lani, go Lani



[Intro]
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope,  sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I don't want no picture with the president
I just wanna talk to the man
Speak for the boys in the bando
And my nigga never walkin' again
Apologize if I'm harpin' again
I know these things happen often
But I'm back on the scene
I was lost in a dream as I write this
The team down in Austin
I been buildin' me a house
Back home in the South, ma
Won't believe what it's costin'
And it's fit for a king, right?
Or a nigga that could sing
And explain all the pain that it cost him
My sixteen should've came with a coffin
Fuck the fame and the fortune
Well, maybe not the fortune
But one thing is for sure though
The fame is exhaustin'
That's why I moved away, I needed privacy
Surrounded by the trees and Ivy League
Students that's recruited highly
Thinkin' "You do you and I do me"
Crib has got a big 'ol back 'ol yard
My niggas stand outside and pass cigars
Filled with marijuana, laughin' hard
Thankful that they friend's a platinum star
In the driveway there's no rapper cars
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Welcome to the Sheltuh, this is pure
We'll help you if you've felt too insecure
To be the star you always knew you were
Wait, I think police is at the door

[Hook]
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope sellin' dope
The neighbors think I'm—neighbors think I'm—
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Well motherfucker, I am

[Verse 2]
Some things you can't escape:
Death, taxes, and a ra-
-cist society that make
Every nigga feel like a candidate
For a Trayvon kinda fate
Even when your crib sit on a lake
Even when your plaques hang on a wall
Even when the president jam your tape
Took a little break just to annotate
How I feel, damn, it's late
I can't sleep cause I'm paranoid
Black in a white man territory
Cops bust in with the army guns
No evidence of the harm we done
Just a couple neighbors that assume we slang
Only time they see us we be on the news, in chains, damn

[Bridge]
Don't follow me
Don't follow me
Don't follow me
Don't follow me

[Hook]
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
The neighbors think I'm...neighbors think I'm—
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Well motherfucker, I am

[Outro]
I am, I am, I am, I am
Well, motherfucker, I am
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
I am, I am, I am
Well, motherfucker, I am
So much for integration
Don't know what I was thinkin'
I'm movin' back to south side
So much for integration
Don't know what I was thinkin'
I'm movin' back to south side



[Verse 1]
Lighting stog after stog, I choke on the smoke
They tell me to quit, don't listen what I'm told
Help me forget that this world is so cold
I don't even know what I'm chasin' no more
Tell me what I want, just keep searchin' on
It's never enough, cup after cup
Blunt after blunt
I wouldn't give one if I could find a fuck, ha, ha, ha, uh
In the cut and I put that on my momma
And my bitch called talkin' 'bout some drama
I swear there ain't no time for women on the come up
It's either the pussy or the commas

[Chorus]
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

[Verse 2]
Uh, yeah, push the gas, get a motherfuckin' nose bleed
She ain't never met a youngin' do it like me
She got a man but she says she really like me
She doin' things to excite me
She sendin' all her friends snaps of my new tracks
'Cause all these hoes know whats about to come next
I hit my plug up, got the paper connect
I drop a couple bands I just wanna go...

[Chorus]
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

[Bridge]
Knowing all of this, it just don't make a difference
I'm just talking shit to the ones that'll listen
I come with the heat man, I swear I'm never missing
And I'm still the same and I swear I'm never switching
Knowing all of this, it just don't make a difference
I'm just talking shit to the ones that'll listen
I come with the heat man, I swear I'm never missing
And I'm still the same and I swear I'm never switching

[Chorus]
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
Cold with the flex

Throw some Jolly Ranchers in, make it sweeter

And she snorting three lines like Adidas
Got a black girl rolling off Molly
Got a white bitch snorting up snow
Say she want real niggas in the party

I got a couple pussy niggas in their feelings
'Cause their main bitch wanna come see me
She said she want more
Your girl is a ho, you need to let go
She fucked all my bros, she's snorting the snow (that coca)

She said she want more
Fuck it, I'ma get more (I'ma get more)

[Verse 1]
I can't count the times
I almost said what's on my mind
But I didn't
Just the other day
I wrote down all the things I'd say
But I couldn't
I just couldn't

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I know that you've been wondering
Mmm, so here goes nothing

[Chorus]
In case you didn't know
Baby, I'm crazy bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know

[Verse 2]
The way you look tonight
That second glass of wine
That did it
There was something 'bout that kiss
Girl it did me in
Got me thinking

[Pre-Chorus]
One of the things that I've been feeling
Mmm, it's time you hear em

[Chorus]
In case you didn't know
Baby, I'm crazy bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know

[Bridge]
You've got all of me
I belong to you
Yeah you're my everything

[Chorus]
In case you didn't know
I'm crazy bout you
I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
Yeah, you had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know
In case you didn't know



[Verse 1: Andrew Taggart]
We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought, “Wow
If I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out”
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought “How
Could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else?”

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Emily Warren]
If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better

[Verse 2: Andrew Taggart]
We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
You look so proud
Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the Internet
Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air of this small town
On our own, cuttin' class for the thrill of it
Getting drunk on the past, we were livin' in

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Emily Warren]
If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better

[Post-Chorus: Emily Warren & Andrew Taggart]
Let's show them we are
Show them we are
Let's show them we are
Show them we are
Let's show them we are better
We were staying in Paris
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are
Show them we are
Let's show them we are
Show them we are
Let's show them we are better

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Emily Warren]
If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better

[Bridge: Andrew Taggart & Emily Warren]
We were staying in Paris (If we go down)
We were staying in Paris (If we go down)
We were staying in Paris (If we go down)
We were staying in Paris (If we go down)
Let's show them we are better
We were staying in Paris

[Outro: Andrew Taggart & Emily Warren]
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better
If we go down
Let's show them we are better
If we go down
Let's show them we are better
If we go down
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better



[Intro]
Yeah, yeah

Alright

[Verse 1]
And she said
"You a god-damn lie"
I ain't mean to say that shit girl I was god-damn high
So we left the crib now we in the god-damn ride
She lookin' god-damn fine
I wanted a bitch who was down to Earth
But she want the god-damn sky, uh
List of my problems
Got this one on my line that won't stop fucking callin'
It's crazy I made her that way
Every time I see her out, I see the hate in her face
Like why you do that?
Tell her you love her when next week you just want your space
Why you do, why you do that?
Tell her you want her but next week you do your own thing
Why you do, why you do that?
I can't explain it but just know it working for me
She text me "I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you"
But how the fuck can you hate me?
When I ain't did shit, but be the real thang
She know I'm the real, that'll never change
I never been the one to try to explain
While you catch them feels I'mma sip on this drank, it's easing my brain

[Hook]
I got real shit to stress about, girl, I ain't worried 'bout shit ('Bout shit)
Remember that I tried to build ya, now I ain't worried 'bout shit
I got real shit to stress about, girl, I ain't worried 'bout shit ('Bout shit)
Remember that I tried to build ya, now I ain't worried 'bout shit
So I found me a new thang, I'm not as lost as you think
Got plenty queens in my hometown, all they need is drank and that dank
So I found me a new thang, I'm not as lost as you think
Got plenty queens in my hometown, all they need is drank and that dank

[Verse 2]
Now I'm like
It's a goddamn shame
We done crashed, we done burned
But baby you the god-damn blame
See I wanted love but you wanted god-damn fame
Every god-damn thang
I wanted a bitch who was on the move
But you want to god-damn lay
Uh, list of my problems
Got this one in my bed and she just wants to sleep
Fucking up all of the sheets
She only wake up to eat
Do this shit every week
Like, why you do that?
Crying you want to be great, but sleepin' until the next day
Why you do that?
Don't got that much in the bank, we go out she order the steak
Why you do, why you do that?
She can't explain it but just know it working for her
She claiming she down on her luck but really she don't give a fuck
And I cannot make this shit up
And I ain't did shit but be the real thang
She know I'm the real, that'll never change
I won't be the one to try to explain
While you catch them feels I'mma sip on this drank, it's easing the pain

[Hook]
I got real shit to stress about, girl, I ain't worried 'bout shit ('Bout shit)
Remember that I tried to build ya, now I ain't worried 'bout shit

Remember that I tried to build ya, now I ain't worried 'bout shit
So I found me a new thang, I'm not as lost as you think
Got plenty queens in my hometown, all they need is drank and that dank
So I found me a new thang, I'm not as lost as you think
Got plenty queens in my hometown, all they need is drank and that dank

[Intro]
First things first: rest in peace Uncle Phil
For real, you the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant, I'ma be a better you
Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville, fulfilled
Listen, even back when we was broke, my team ill
Martin Luther King woulda been on Dreamville
Talk to a nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Verse 1]
No role models and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed
By the baddest bitch, not Trina but I swear to God
This bitch'll make you call your girl up
And tell her, "Hey, what's good?"
"Sorry I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good."
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, "Nah, I was the same without it."
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
Before I started callin' bitches "bitches" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
You wasn't sweatin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Verse 2]
I want a real love, dark skinned Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga, I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do'
Nigga, you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt 'fore she leave
I'ma need my shirt back (nigga, you know how it go)

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Interlude: George W. Bush]
There's an old saying in Tennessee—I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee—that says, fool me once… shame on… shame on you. Fool me, you can't get fooled again.

[Bridge]
Fool me one time, shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you
Fool me one time, shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you

[Verse 3]
My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script, the bitch probably couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret, could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

Put your ice on rocks, they need to help me

[Verse 1: Future & Young Thug]
No baby, your collection, won't stand for it
You know you're in relationship with all us

Get in your bag, uh, yeah, get in your bag, uh
Hundred new purse for a brat, uh, comin' down the street, new Jag
Turbo bitch 'bout to drag, nigga had M's 'fore ass
Got a brand new bitch, who that?
Rock the flooded AP, all black
White toes, give me a tan, cocaine, killing time
All a bitch wanna do is shine, Audemars, pick which kind
I made you a starter, you went from a dime to a quarter
I Chico DeBarge it, I'm leaving that loud in apartments, yeah
Don't play with a sergeant, I'm ready to spoil it
She suck on my dick, I'm hidin' in the closet
I'm higher than the moon, three mil' in the room
You get silver spoon, I bought you some goons

[Chorus: Young Thug & Future]

[Verse 2: Future & Young Thug]
I don't do jet-skis, give me the yacht please
I made you queen status, check out my lean status
I'm in a relationship with all my bitches, yeah
I put my dick inside her mouth before she left
Yeah, I built relationships with all my bitches, yes
I put my dick right in her mouth before she act
I got your bitch in a backpack
I paid extra for the crib, it got a kid shack
I paid extra for the crib, it got a game room
Got a penthouse in the back, it ain't my main room
Tamika, Jo and Porsche they kept it solid
That's the only reason I let 'em fly private

[Chorus: Young Thug & Future]
Shinin' hard 'cause we back up
Rose gold from your neck up
You know shit gon' get sloppy, tryna check us
Pop an X pill like we Malcolm, yeah, hey

You heard, spit it, yo

[Chorus: Future]
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Rep the set, gotta rep the set

Percocets, molly, Percocets
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Don't chase no bitches

[Verse 1: Future]
Two cups, toast up with the gang
From food stamps to a whole 'nother domain
Out the bottom, I'm the livin' proof (super)
Ain't compromising, half a million on a coupe
Drug houses, lookin' like Peru
Graduated, I was overdue
Pink molly, I can barely move
Ask about me, I'm gon' bust a move
Rick James, thirty-three chains
Ocean air, cruisin' Biscayne
Top off, that’s a liability
Hit the gas, boostin' my adrenaline

[Chorus: Future]
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Rep the set, gotta rep the set
Chase a check, never chase a bitch

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, I got a halo
I level up every time God say so
Shooter on payroll
Lookin' like Pancho, lookin' like Pedro
Money tree from Tarzan
Ten dividends gon' grow when I say "grow"
Kung Fu Kenny with the Midas touch
Ain't no penny that I don't touch
All my enemy bite on dust
Ain't no talkin' when it's fatal
Havin' heart, I can't tell
Half of y'all might need help
I might fall in Rodeo (bitch)
I might ball in Australia (say no more)
I might call her for real (say no more)
All the ass gon' unveil
Wind blows in the windows
And I snuck in when the vent close
She copy like 10-4
Know who we sent for
Platinum, platinum, platinum
Gotta look at self and ask what happened
How y'all let a conscious nigga go commercial
While only makin' conscious albums?
How y'all let the braids on TV?
How y'all let the hood at the table?
Now y'all don't even know how to rate him
Niggas lookin' like I'm a created player
Everybody who didn't pay respect
Gotta 'fess up now and pay ya debts
Gotta lay somethin' down if makin' threats
Gotta say somethin' now, don't hold ya breath
I mean, I'm floatin', I got the sauce, got the potion
I got 'em all in convulsions and emotions
I put careers in negotions
And put the body in the ocean
I made an oath when my nigga told me to go in
Then he died on a cold bench
All my old friends livin' life on a slow end
Gotta keep shit rollin', it's deep (it's deep)
I done fucked so much, I can't sleep
I done fucked so much, I'm retired (swear to God)
I'm 'bout to live my life through Dave Free (swear to God)
She said she broke down when Prince died (it's alright)
Bitch, my hair down, Prince live through me (I am Prince)
Get your ass up and be inspired (get inspired)
You know how many bodies in the street? (how many?)
Take the mask off so you can see

[Chorus: Future]
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Rep the set, gotta rep the set
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Don't chase no bitches

[Outro: Future]
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Gas gone, never nod off
Vengeance is mine, said the Lord

Taking pain pills on the plane, gettin' chartered
Poppin' tags on tags, I was starvin'

Turn a five star hotel to a traphouse
Roaches everywhere, like we forgot to take the trash out
Flood my cross with ice, gettin' money my religion
Got my baby momma and my side bitch kissin'

This the sixth time gettin' kicked out
I can't feel my face, I'm on Adderall, nauseous
Niggas tryna ride my fuckin' wave, now they salty

Shoot you in your back like you Ricky

[Intro: Swae Lee & Gucci Mane]
Black Beatles in the city
Be back immediately to confiscate the moneys
(Ear Drummers)
Rae Sremm, Guwop, Mike WiLL!
I sent flowers, but you said you didn't receive 'em
But you said you didn't need 'em (Mike WiLL!)

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinking
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Getting so gone I'm not blinkin'
What in the world was I thinkin'?
New day, new money to be made
There is nothin' to explain
I'm a fuckin' black Beatle, cream seats in the Regal
Rockin' John Lennon lenses, like to see ‘em spread eagle
Took a bitch to the club and let her party on the table
Screamin', "Everybody's famous!"
Like clockwork, I blow it all
And get some more
Get you somebody that can do both
Black Beatles got the babes belly rollin'
She think she love me, I think she trollin'

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Came in with two girls, look like strippers in their real clothes
A broke ho can only point me to a rich ho
A yellow bitch with green hair, a real weirdo
Black man, yellow Lamb', red light go
They seen that Guwop and them just came in through the side door
There's so much money on the floor we buyin' school clothes
Why you bring the money machine to the club for?
Pint of lean, pound of weed, and a kilo
I Eurostep past a hater like I'm Rondo
I upgrade your baby mama to a condo
Like Chapo servin' yayo to the gringos
Black Beatle, club close when I say so

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

[Verse 3: Slim Jxmmi]
She's a good teaser, and we blowin' reefer
Your body like a work of art, baby
Don't fuck with me, I'll break your heart, baby
D&G on me, I got a lot of flavor
15 hundred on my feet, I'm tryna kill these haters
I had haters when I was broke, I'm rich, I still got haters
I had hoes when I was broke, I'm rich, I'm still a player
I wear leather Gucci jackets like it's still the 80s
I've been blowin' OG Kush, I feel a lil' sedated
I can't worry about a broke nigga or a hater
Black Beatle, bitch, me and Paul McCartney related

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle



[Verse 1]
I used to leave the doors unlocked and leave the lights on
I used to stay awake, just counting hours all night long
I had so many empty rooms inside this chateau
Yeah, oh yeah
I'm done with sharing space with people that I don't know
Trading pieces of my heart 'til I felt shallow
I had so many empty rooms inside this chateau, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
But ever since I met you
No vacancy because of you
There's no vacancy, no empty rooms
Got no vacancy, ever since I met you
No vacancy because of you

[Chorus]
Used to be that I felt so damn empty
Ever since I met you, no vacancy
Used to be that I felt so damn empty
Ever since I met you, no vacancy
No vacancy, no vacancy
Used to be that I felt so damn empty
Ever since I met you, no vacancy
Used to be that I felt so damn empty
Ever since I met you, no vacancy
No vacancy, no vacancy

[Verse 2]
I used to be the type to never take a chance, oh
Had so many walls, you'd think I was a castle
I spent so many empty nights with faces I don't know

[Pre-Chorus]
But ever since I met you
No vacancy because of you
There's no vacancy, no empty rooms
Got no vacancy ever since I met you
No vacancy because of you

[Chorus]
Used to be that I felt so damn empty
Ever since I met you, no vacancy
Used to be that I felt so damn empty
Ever since I met you, no vacancy
No vacancy, no vacancy

[Bridge]
Come on, come on, listen, oh yeah
Come on, come on, listen, oh yeah
When I fell, I fell, I fell, I fell for you
So no vacancy, no vacancy

[Chorus]
Used to be that I felt so damn empty
Ever since I met you, no vacancy
Used to be that I felt so damn empty
Ever since I met you, no vacancy
No vacancy, no vacancy

[Outro]
Come on, come on, listen
No vacancy, oh yeah
Oh yeah, no vacancy

But I know what they want from me, dollars, lot of stock in me
It ain't nothing personal, it's business and I'm a commodity

When there's a boss in me, I'll be damned

I got so many felonies, I might can't never go to Canada
But Drake said he gon' pull some strings, so let me check my calendar
I just popped me one of them one what-you-call-its and it boosted my stamina
Now I'm fucking her on the banister, guess I just East Atlanta'd her
I'm in an all-red drop tarantula, fuck a Challenger
Damn these hoes ain't got no manners, bruh, where's the manager?
I keep throwing rubber bandies up, hoe, pull your panties up
Cause you fuck like a granny fuck, you're just an amateur
This Patek Philipe gon' make this crooked judge try throw the book at me
I look like half a million worth of heroin when she look at me
But you ain't gotta fuck with me, my nig, but you're stuck with me
But how you called the cops on me, my nig? You grew up with me

[Hook: Drake]
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high

I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, I'm both
Yeah, I had a drink, yeah, I smoked
Yeah, you think I need you but I don't
Just left out Dubai with all my folk
Open water, my location is remote
Shout-out Yachty but this ain't a Lil Boat
This some shit I wrote about when I was broke
See, the power of the mind is not a joke
Man, I said that I would do it and I did
Used to get left-overs out the fridge
Nobody was famous where I lived
Till I got it jumping at the crib
Took a lot to be able to give, I mean

[Hook: Drake]
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jeremih]
I think I’m ready to jump out the window
And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend, though
We already wasted too much time
And your time is the only thing I wish was mine
So yeah, oh yeah, I think I’m ready to jump out the window

[Verse 1]
Straight up, straight up, look
Know ya momma didn’t raise you to take no disrespect, yeah
I feel, I feel like real queens know how to keep the game in check, yeah
You cried on my phone the whole night
That time he crossed the line yeah, yeah, yeah
(Oh I was there) I went to straighten his ass out
And you told me never mind yeah, yeah, yeah
The question isn't, "Do he love ya?" The question is, "Do ya love yourself?"
You give the best advice to your friends and not take it for yourself
Remember when you used to come through and hit the Mario Kart
And you always picked the princess
I realized you was princess way back then
We the best thing that never happened, but

[Chorus]
I think I'm ready to jump out the window
And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend though
We already wasted too much time
And your time is the only thing I wish was mine
So yeah, oh yeah, I think I'm ready to jump out the window

[Verse 2]
You been up at night, sleep deprivation
What's the hesitation? What's ya reservation?
You been trippin', trippin' with no destination
You need separation, you need recreation
Y'all been arguing every other day
Ya friends gotta step in and break it up like chill, chill, chill
It's no need to turn this into Kill Bill, look
Funny we ran into each other while we leaving
You walked in with a perm
And now yo' hair look like The Weeknd's
I know that you been needin' clarity
Don't mean to sit ya down and turn this into therapy
But you gave too much time to that boy charity, hear me

[Chorus]
I think I'm ready to jump out the window
And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend, though
We already wasted too much time
And your time is the only thing I wish was mine
So yeah, oh yeah, I think I'm ready to jump out the window

[Outro]
I don't mean to sound like the jealous type
But you oughta know (oughta know)
I think me and you should get together sometimes
On the low low low
Sometimes I wonder if you even know
How much you worth, I gotta know
Sometimes I wonder if you even know
How much you worth, I gotta know
I don't mean to sound like the jealous type
But you oughta know (oughta know)
I think me and you should get together sometimes
On the low low low
Sometimes I wonder if you even know
How much you worth, I gotta know
Sometimes I wonder if you even know
How much you worth I gotta know
I gotta know, I gotta know, I gotta know
I think I'm ready to jump out the window
This one's for you, you, you, you, you, you, you



[Verse 1]
When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

[Pre-Chorus]
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

[Verse 2]
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

[Pre-Chorus]
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

[Bridge]
One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill



[Verse 1]
I'm a dirt road in the headlights
I'm a mama's boy, I'm a fist fight
Kinda county line, kinda cold beer
Little hat down, little John Deere
I kinda give a damn
I kinda don't care
You see that girl standing right there

[Chorus]
She loves a small town boy like me
She's my ride or die baby
She's my cool, she's my crazy
She's my laid back in the front seat
She's my with me to the end girl
I'm turning it up to ten girl
She can have anybody that she wants
Or be anywhere she wants to be
She loves a small town boy like me

[Verse 2]
She likes my T-shirt
She likes my old boots
Likes to slow dance to some old school
She'll take a full moon over those city nights
And I ain't scared to get all up in them bright lights
Yeah, I can smooth it out
I can stick it up
I guess that's why she can't get enough of

[Chorus]
A small town boy like me
She's my ride or die baby
She's my cool, she's my crazy
She's my laid back in the front seat
She's my with me to the end girl
I'm turning it up to ten girl
She can have anybody that she wants
Or be anywhere she wants to be
She loves a small town boy like me
She loves a small town boy like me, yeah

I take a plan and then I back-to-back it
Hit after hit, check the batting average
I take the work, flip it, acrobatic
Got a little time and a lot of talent
Do a little talking and a lot of action
Seen the competition, hm, not a challenge
I lean, I move, I walk through in this bitch
Packed out, but I can count on my hands who I'ma talk to in this bitch
Girls from law school in this bitch
Yeah, they paralegals
Barely 21, that's very legal
But they doing shit that's probably barely legal, aw, man
It's that nigga that you probably least expected
I just had a couple dots that need connecting
Now your top five getting redirected
From here on out, it'll be consecutive
We making moves like Tarantino, like J.J. Abrams
Moving like Channing Tatum
Moving like Jason Statham
Motherfuck the whole industry
Half of these niggas my mini-me's
I got this bitch going off more than breaking and entering
You hot for a minute, me
I make the shit that last for infinity
Hop in the booth, man, that shit like a gym to me, don't test the agility
Silly, silly, thinking that the negativity you talking could ever fuck up the tranquility
Okay, okay, okay, I'm on Rodeo for the day
If you owe me then you better pay your layaway, away
Stay away, or your ass might get K.O., kay today
Man, that "pew! pew!" hit your ass from like way, a-ways, away

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Off top, run a nigga out his socks
Niggas talk more than bitches
Niggas really be on cock though
Just fucked a ho out in France
Paint her face like Picasso
I iced out my vatos, I'm really up
Big ass Beamer, big Benz and my Bentley next
Stop playin' around on my phone ho, gimme sex
Watch on my wrist out of date, but it's Rolex
Grizzley up next, I'm up now
Strap your bullet vest

[Verse 2: Tee Grizzley]
500 50's, 600 hundreds
700 20's, let's get straight to it
800 10's, what's that, 8 bands?
Hit the store and get some rubber bands
Let's get straight to it
Everybody come together, everybody got the plan
He came with you, so if he steal it fall on you, we on your ass
Have your mans call his mans, make sure they ain't movin' fast
Soon as they touch Atlanta, get with Boat
Secure the bag, nigga

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
Oh, A bag secure, that's on my mama, bro
Asian lil' ho, she ride that dick, Yokohama flow
Made that shit double, got an Uzi, I don't scuffle
Not a banger but that banger in my car like an airbag
Niggas only aimin' in the sky, call those Air Mags
All up in Neiman's, coppin' shit like fuck a price tag
I'm ballin', ain't near a rap nigga in the game that I'm callin'
If I need help, I'll dial it by my se-kelf

[Verse 4: Tee Grizzley & Lil Yachty]
You swear your bitch faithful, she sent her location
I hit her at the trap in Decatur, she basic (Crazy)
Chop with the laser, get decapitated
Can't smoke, I'm on papers
Hold on, this my Jamaican (love one)
Niggas want me dead, so I'm steady prayin'
Ain't no disrespect without retaliation
Fuck a hotel, I hit her in the basement
Text her later like, "I'm done with you
I got a situation, baby"

[Verse 5: Lil Yachty]
Well shit, bro, let me get her then
I'ma dog her out then switcheroo into the lion's den
Nigga talkin' down, my bro got more heat than a fryin' pan
Gucci 'round my hair, wrapped tight like I'm Taliban

[Verse 6: Tee Grizzley]
Like I'm Taliban, how we drop shit (we go)
Lot of dreadheads, lot of chopsticks
Touch my nigga Yachty, get your top ripped
Don't ask the price if you know you ain't tryna cop shit

[Verse 7: Lil Yachty]
You the type to look around but never cop shit, ayy
I'm the type to buy the store, make them restock it, ayy
Beam on everythin' I own, I will not miss
Grizzley by my side like a pilot ridin' cockpit

[Verse 8: Tee Grizzley & Lil Yachty]
Yachty, I might stop rappin' for this one reason (oh, for real?)
If the Feds hear this shit I'm doin' a hundred seasons
In the hood, shootin' craps in my Yeezys
Put angels on you niggas who be playin' like y'all demons
You dig?

[Verse 9: Lil Yachty]
Middle finger to them niggas hatin' and fakin'
They plottin' on my death, I give their mothers deep penetration
Diamond choker for some reason give me pure ventilation
Every real nigga livin' will respect this collaboration

[Verse 10: Tee Grizzley]
We the bust down brothers, check the Rollies out
Say you winnin' one more time, I'm pullin' trophies out
Niggas know we out, no Shaqs, all Kobes out
In other words, I'm with all shooters that'll blow you down

[Verse 11: Lil Yachty]
From the D to the A, put respect on it
If that's your ho, why my dick got her mouth on it?
I'm from the south, I got diamonds in my teeth
I got fur on my fleece, my new ring could pay your lease

[Verse 12: Tee Grizzley]
Lease, nigga
Chain on my dresser next to my indictment
When they said not guilty I was so excited
From the A to the D, bitch you heard Yachty
Wraith comin' this summer, I'ma have your bitch drivin'
Bitch!




Letra de "Escápate Conmigo" ft. Ozuna[Intro: Wisin, Ozuna]
Ozuna, W

Será la magia que tienen tus ojos
Y esos truquitos para enamorar
Tú me seduces a tu antojo
Y de tu hechizo no puedo escapar
Qué ganas tengo de buscarte (aja)
Y de volverte a besar (baby)
Por más que traten de alejarte
Baby, hoy conmigo tú te vas

Yo sólo quiero que confíes en mí y seas valiente, bebé

[Pre-Coro: Ozuna, (Wisin)]
Escápate conmigo esta noche, bebé (aja)
Te quiero comer, te va a encantar
Tú sabes que conmigo siempre la pasas bien (la pasas bien)
Te quiero comer, tus labios besar

[Coro: Wisin, Ozuna]
Bebé, no digas que no (no, no)
Si sólo somos tú y yo (yey, yey, yey)
Si se te eriza la piel (se te eriza la piel)
Cuando entramos en calor
Bebé, no digas que no (no, no)
Si sólo somos tú y yo (yey, yey, yey)
Si se te eriza la piel (se te eriza la piel)
Cuando entramos en calor (llenos de sudor)

Señores, la poderosa

[Verso 1: Wisin]
Mi supernova, la que una sonrisa me roba
Tremenda loba, sólo un beso y calienta la alcoba
Se me pega y me soba, no se incomoda
La baby es una pantera, yo soy su casanova
Escápate conmigo, donde no haya testigos
Si te preguntan, diles que soy tu mejor amigo
Yo quiero un beso, tú quieres castigo
Sabes que no te obligo
Te deseo, siempre te lo digo

Mamita, deja la ventana abierta

[Pre-coro: Ozuna, (Wisin)]
Escápate conmigo esta noche, bebé
Te quiero comer, te va a encantar
Tú sabes que conmigo siempre la pasas bien (la pasas bien)
Te quiero comer, tus labios besar

(Yo en verdad no sé qué tiene)

[Puente: Wisin, Ozuna]
Es que yo quiero un poco más (un poco más)
De tu rica desnudez (de tu desnudez)
Es que el sudor de tu piel (de tu piel)
Es el que yo quiero probar (princesa)
Es que yo quiero un poco más (un poco más)
De tu rica desnudez (de tu desnudez)
Es que el sudor de tu piel (yeah)
Es el que yo quiero probar

Baby, andamos con los poderes
Ozuna

[Verso 2: Ozuna, (Wisin)]
Dime que descontrola
Y si la llamo, ella me dice que la busque que está sola
Que no hay tiempo, pero haciéndolo se demora
Si le fallo, usted tranquilo, porque no se enamora
Tranquila, la vida conmigo te la vacilas
Que no he visto otra baby de tu liga
Esos besitos que me dan ganas
De amanecer contigo todas las mañanas

(Cada madrugada estoy en tu casa)

[Pre-coro: Wisin, Ozuna]
Escápate conmigo esta noche, bebé (aja)
Te quiero comer, te va a encantar
Tú sabes que conmigo siempre la pasas bien
Te quiero comer, tus labios besar

[Coro: Wisin, Ozuna]
Bebé, no digas que no (no, no)
Si sólo somos tú y yo (yey, yey, yey)
Si se te eriza la piel (se te eriza la piel)
Cuando entramos en calor
Bebé, no digas que no (no, no)
Si sólo somos tú y yo (yey, yey, yey)
Si se te eriza la piel (se te eriza la piel)
Cuando entramos en calor (llenos de sudor)

I love my baby, when I come home, I be rubbin' on her feet
And she be always in my chair, she hate when I be in the streets

You think a nigga in a band the way I hit him with that drum, ayy

[Chorus]
I'm sippin' on Belaire, my chick from Bel-Air
My whip from Germany, I'm cooler than LL
I'm sippin' on Belaire, my chick from Bel-Air
My whip from Germany, I'm cooler than LL
I clap a nigga like patty cake
I clap a nigga like patty cake
I'm swaggin', I got flavor, I got sauce, call me Ragu
I love my baby girl pussy bald, call her Caillou
I clap a nigga like patty cake

[Verse 2]
My chain VVS
I'm booted up, I got more pills than a CVS
I'm the shit, baby girl, so I got stains in my drawers
All this money like a nigga hit the fuckin' Power Ball
Sippin' on champagne, my whip on Dana Dane's
No time for you lames, I'm flyer than a plane
I'm ridin' like a train, she love to give me brain
You shootin' with your eyes closed, you ain't Sniper Gang
She held me down when I was gone, I bought her Audemars Piguet
I love her like I love my brother, so I let her be my connect
I put her thick ass in the vet, ten bracelets on her neck
You know lil' Kodak love to flex, I got my momma out the 'jects

[Chorus]
I'm sippin' on Belaire, my chick from Bel-Air
My whip from Germany, I'm cooler than LL
I'm sippin' on Belaire, my chick from Bel-Air
My whip from Germany, I'm cooler than LL
I clap a nigga like patty cake
I clap a nigga like patty cake
I'm swaggin', I got flavor, I got sauce, call me Ragu
I love my baby girl pussy bald, call her Caillou
I clap a nigga like patty cake



[Verse 1]
I’ve been hearin' symphonies
Before, all I heard was silence
A rhapsody for you and me
And every melody is timeless
Life was stringin' me along
Then you came and you cut me loose
Was solo, singin' on my own
Now I can’t find the key without you

[Pre-Chorus]
And now your song is on repeat
And I’m dancin' on to your heartbeat
And when you’re gone, I feel incomplete
So, if you want the truth...

[Chorus]
I just wanna be part of your symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
Symphony
Like a love song on the radio
Will you hold me tight and not let go?

[Verse 2]
I’m sorry if it’s all too much
Every day you’re here, I’m healin'
And I was runnin' outta luck
I never thought I’d find this feelin'
'Cause I’ve been hearin' symphonies
Before all I heard was silence
A rhapsody for you and me (a rhapsody for you and me)
And every melody is timeless

[Pre-Chorus]
And now your song is on repeat
And I’m dancin' on to your heartbeat
And when you’re gone, I feel incomplete
So, if you want the truth...

[Chorus]
I just wanna be part of your symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
Symphony
Like a love song on the radio
Will you hold me tight and not let go?

[Interlude]
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
And now your song is on repeat
And I’m dancin' on, to your heartbeat
And when you’re gone, I feel incomplete
So if you want the truth (oh)

[Chorus: Zara Larsson]
I just wanna be part of your symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
Symphony
Like a love song on the radio
Symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
Symphony
Like a love song on the radio
Will you hold me tight and not let go?



[Intro]
Okay I was gone for a minute but I'm back now
Sit the fuck back down
Seem like everybody nowadays Hollywood
Oh it’s like that now?
I'ma show you mothafuckas how to act now
I'ma show em how to act
I'ma show em how to act

[Verse 1]
Okay now picture little Bobby just a youngin' runnin' round
With his mans, hammer in his hands, feelin' like the man
Run, mothafucka, run
Before the popo get the gun, put it to your brain like goddamn!
Everybody know you ain't about it
Everything you talk about I know I can live without it
Red light, stop. Green light, go!
Everything ain't what it seem like
Mothafucka I know!
Hold up, what you mean, where you been?
Bitch I been in
This is merely the beginning again
What you been living in?
A box, under the bridge, like Anthony Kiedis?
Looking for something to complete us
And maybe lead us, fuck an elitist
Hell of a long way from equal is how they treat us
Body of a builder with the mind of a fetus
Turn on the television and see the vision they feed us
And I wish I could erase that, face facts

[Chorus]
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know, how it go
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know

[Verse 2]
I been knockin doors down like a Jehovah witness
God as my witness, I'm with this
But on the real I think I need another witness!
If it was 1717, black daddy, white momma wouldn't change a thing
Light skin mothafucka certified as a house nigga
Well I'll be God damned, go figure
In my blood is the slave and the master
It's like the devil playin spades with the pastor
But he was born with the white privilege!
Man what the fuck is that?
White people told me as a child, as a little boy, playin with his toys
I should be ashamed to be black
And some black people look ashamed when I rap
Like my great granddaddy didn’t take a whip to the back
Not accepted by the black or the white
I don't give a fuck, praise God, I could see the light
Everybody talkin' 'bout race this, race that
I wish I could erase that, face facts

[Chorus]
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know, how it go
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know

[Outro]
Okay I was gone for a minute but I'm back now
Sit the fuck back down
Seem like everybody nowadays Hollywood
Oh it's like that now?
I'ma show you mothafuckas how to act now
I'ma show em how to act
I'ma show em how to act



[Verse 1: Rob $tone]
Rob $tone, two damn phones
Babylons can't crack the code (no)
Used to sip out styrofoam
But figured I should stick to dro (trees!)
Backwoods overload
Don't like to smoke them swishers, ho
If you hit my liquor store
It's 50 cents for single Ports

[Hook: Rob $tone]
Said she wanna roll with me and smoke up all my weed
I said, "Baby just buy Dutches 'cause you can't smoke for free
I got some loud but no money, babe, buy me a Fiji"
She said, "You need a job", bitch, fuck a job, I still get cheese

[Verse 2: J. Davi$]
Two cell phones, Mr. Mothafuck-A-Thot
Mr. I-Be-On-That-Block, 12-07 fuck an op
They hear my name, they see my squad
Rolling dope up on the spot
I'm with your bitch, she on my jock
Ain't got no time to love a thot
Got niggas mad, my flow so hot
Got niggas mad, my squad won't stop
We in the game, won't take no loss
I'm sippin' water out the Voss
Got lean all in my fuckin' Sprite
Turnin' up on fuckin' sight
Mr. Kenny Powers
Bout to take your girlfriend home tonight, bitch

[Verse 3: Spooks]
And I'm smokin' on that widow when you see it out the window
Got a dusty old tee, lookin' bummy, leave it simple
Growin' up, I was always in the middle
So I gotta hold it down for my older and my little
And my brothas beside me so fuck it we mobbin' deep
Always grimey, no findin' me but I be in LG
If your lil' fuckboy lame ass wanna creep
I live by the lemon 'cause that fucka chose me

[Hook: Rob $tone]
Said she wanna roll with me and smoke up all my weed
I said, "Baby just buy Dutches 'cause you can't smoke for free
I got some loud but no money, babe, buy me a Fiji"
She said, "You need a job", bitch, fuck a job, I still get cheese



[Chorus]
Drivin' solo, I'm just swervin' through my ends
When I'm sober I just don't like who I am
Pour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again
Roll me up some dope and I'll feel like myself again
I'ma break every box they try to put me in
I got a lot of enemies who used to be my friends
Pour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again
Roll me up some dope and I'll feel like myself again

[Verse 1]
I was sober for an hour but I'm rollin' off a bean now
The drugs, they give me confidence, I'm sayin' what I mean now
The xannies help me slow up, the lean it help me speed down
Ballin', yeah I'm ballin', I won't hit it if she beat now
Callin', yeah she callin', your bitch got me on the speed dial
Driving through the Rex I look at faces don't see no smiles
It's grimy in the 6, who can I trust? I'll never know now
Sprite is extra dark now, my doggie in the dog pound
They say I'm on the come up, but I've been on the come down
See me doin' good, they start to hate, that's how it goes now
I don't know why they mad at me, I always stay ten toes down
Drivin' through my city by myself, that's how I roll now

[Chorus]
Drivin' solo, I'm just swervin' through my ends
When I'm sober I just don't like who I am
Pour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again
Roll me up some dope and I'll feel like myself again
I'ma break every box they try to put me in
I got a lot of enemies who used to be my friends
Pour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again
Roll me up some dope and I'll feel like myself again

[Verse 2]
I remember being a kid my teachers told me I wouldn't be shit
Diamonds in my pinky, look like water, make me seasick
Never had no help so don't approach me on some free shit
Did this by myself so why the fuck would I do a remix?
His bitch gave me top, don't want the pussy, he can keep it
Money and the power, fuck respect 'cause I don't need it
Drivin' to the west, I popped a bean and now I'm speedin'
Know some people in the 6 that dissed me for no reason
Sending shots, they sendin' shots, on road I never see them
Taking Ls, they takin' Ls, I never wanna be them
Got your bitch beside me, she just asked me what a bean is
Put her number in my phone, and you know I delete it

[Chorus]
Drivin' solo, I'm just swervin' through my ends
When I'm sober I just don't like who I am
Pour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again
Roll me up some dope and I'll feel like myself again
I'ma break every box they try to put me in
I got a lot of enemies who used to be my friends
Pour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again
Roll me up some dope and I'll feel like myself again

[Outro]
Drivin' solo, I'm just swervin' through my ends
Pour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again
I'ma break every box they try to put me in
Pour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again
Roll me up some dope and I'll feel like myself again

Drivin' solo, I'm just swervin' through my ends



[Verse 1]
You walked into the room
And now my heart's been stolen
You took me back in time to when I was unbroken
Now you're all I want
And I knew it from the very first moment
Cause a light came on when I heard that song
And I want you to sing it again

[Chorus]
I swear that every word you sing
You wrote them for me
Like it was a private show
But I know you never saw me
When the lights come on and I'm on my own
Will you be there to sing it again
Could I be the one you talk about in all your stories
Can I be him

[Verse 2]
I heard there was somone but I know he don't deserve you
If you were mine I'd never let anyone hurt you
I wanna dry those tears, kiss those lips
It's all that I've been thinking about
Cause a light came on when I heard that song
And I want you to sing it again

[Chorus]
I swear that every word you sing
You wrote them for me
Like it was a private show
But I know you never saw me
When the lights come on and I'm on my own
Will you be there to sing it again
Could I be the one you talk about in all your stories

[Bridge]
Can I be the one
Can I be the one
Can I be the one
Oh, can I, can I be him

Won't you sing it again
Oh, when you sing it again
Can I be him
Won't you sing it again
Oh, when you sing it again
Can I be him

[Chorus]
I swear that every word you sing
You wrote them for me
Like it was a private show
But I know you never saw me
When the lights come on and I'm on my own
Will you be there, will you be there
Can I be the one you talk about in all your stories
Can I be him
Can I be him
Can I be him
Can I be him



[Verse 1: Kane Brown]
You say what if I hurt you, what if I leave you
What if I find somebody else and I don't need you?
What if this goes south, what if I mess you up?
You say what if I break your heart in two, then what?

[Pre-Chorus: Kane Brown]
Well I hear you girl, I feel you girl, but not so fast
Before you make your mind up, I gotta ask

[Chorus: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close, what if I lean in?
And the stars line up, and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days, baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?

[Verse 2: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
What if the sky falls (sky falls)
Or the sun stops burnin'?
We could worry about them what ifs 'til the world stops turnin'?
Or I could kiss you (you should kiss me)
What if you liked it? (bet I'd like it)
Well we ain't never gonna know unless we try it

[Chorus: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close, what if I lean in?
And the stars line up, and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?
Awe yeah
C'mon

[Bridge: Kane Brown]
You say what if I hurt you, what if I leave you?
What if I find somebody else and I don't need you?
Damn

[Chorus: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close, what if I lean in?
And the stars line up, and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?

[Outro: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
Away (away)
What if?



[Verse 1]
Record man play my song on the radio
You too busy tryna find that blue-eyed soul
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I swear too much on the regular
We gone let them hits fly, we gone let it go
If it ain't XO then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talking 'bout a face numbing off a bag of blow
I'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate
All my niggas blew up like a propane
All these R&B niggas be so lame
Got a sweet Asian chick, she go Lo Mein

[Chorus]
You know me, you know man, you know me
Every time you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me (pow! pow!), you know me

[Verse 2]
Said I'm just tryna swim in something wetter than the ocean
Faded off a double cup, I'm mixing up the potion
All I wanna do is make that money and make dope shit
It just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit
Everybody knows it, all these niggas know me
Platinum off a mixtape, sipping on that codeine
Pour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed
I'ma keep on singing while I'm burning up that OG
All my niggas get it they make money all alone
Rock a chain around they neck, making sure I'm getting home
When I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil' a show
And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know
Used to walk around with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor
Now my shit straight
Eating all day, tryna lose weight
That good sex, we'll sweat it out
Hotel bed springs, we'll wear it out
I ain't gotta tell you 'cause

[Chorus]
You know me, you know me
You know man, you know me
Every time you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me (pow! pow!), you know me

[Bridge]
Why don't you shake some, shake somethin'
For the Don? Don't you break nothin', break nothin'
Baby girl, won't you work some, work somethin'
For the Don? Don't you hurt nothin', hurt nothin'
Big girl, won't you shake some, shake somethin'
For the Don? Don't you break nothin', break nothin'
Baby girl, won't you work some, work somethin'
For the Don? don't you hurt nothin', hurt nothin'

[Outro]
'Cause you know me, they know me
You ain't know me, yet you know me



[Verse 1]
"No thank you" is what I should've said
I should be in bed
But temptations of trouble on my tongue
Troubles yet to come

[Pre-Chorus]
One sip, bad for me
One hit, bad for me
One kiss, bad for me
But I give in so easily
And no thank you is how it should've gone
I should stay strong

[Chorus]
But I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak

(Ooh waaaaaaa ee ya ee ya)
(Ooh waaaaaaa ee ya ee ya)
But I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
(Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that)

[Verse 2]
No thank you
They call me after dark, I don't want no part
My habits, they hold me like a grudge
I promise I won't budge

[Pre-Chorus]
One sip, bad for me
One hit, bad for me
One kiss, bad for me
But I give in so easily
And no thank you is how it should've gone
I should stay strong

[Chorus]
But I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak
(Ooh waaaaaaa ee ya ee ya)
(Ooh waaaaaaa ee ya ee ya)
But I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that

[Bridge]
We, we fall for that
Wake up, we fall again
We, we fall for that
Can't wait to fall again

[Pre-Chorus]
One sip, bad for me
One hit, bad for me
One kiss, bad for me
But I give in so easily
And no thank you is how it should've gone
I should stay strong

[Chorus]
But I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak
Go!
(Ooh waaaaaaa ee ya ee ya)
(Ooh waaaaaaa ee ya ee ya)
But I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
Ooh waaaaaaa ee ya ee yaaaaa



[Verse 1]
Can't keep my hands to myself
Think I'll dust 'em off, put 'em back up on the shelf
In case my little baby girl is in need
Am I coming out of left field?

[Chorus 1]
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I been feeling it since 1966, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

[Verse 2]
Got another mouth to feed
Leave it with a baby sitter, mama, call the grave digger
Gone with the fallen leaves
Am I coming out of left field?

[Chorus 2]
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I been feeling it since 1966, now
Might've had your fill, but you feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

[Verse 3]
We could fight a war for peace
(Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now)
Give in to that easy living
Goodbye to my hopes and dreams
Start flipping for my enemies
We could wait until the walls come down
(Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now)
It's time to give a little to the kids in the middle
But, oh until it falls
Won't bother me

[Bridge]
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming back?

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, yeah
Your love is an abyss for my heart to eclipse, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

[Chorus 3]
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I've been feeling it since 1966, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Might've had your fill, but I feel it still

I want you bad as ever
Don't let me just let up

Baby, it's whatever
Somebody gotta step up
Girl, I'm that somebody, so I'm next up
Be damned if I let him catch up
It's easy to see that you're fed up
I am on a whole 'nother level
Girl, he only fucked you over cause you let him
Fuck him, girl, I guess he didn't know any better
Girl, that man didn't show any effort
Do all I can just to show you you're special
Certain it's your love that holds me together
Lately you say he been killin' the vibe
Gotta be sick of this guy
Pull up, skrr, get in the ride
Left hand is steerin' the other is grippin' your thigh
Light up a spliff and get high
Shawty, you deserve what you've been missin'
Lookin' at you I'm thinkin' he must be trippin'
Play this song for him, tell him, "Just listen"

[Hook]
Don't

Girl, said he keeps on playin' games
And his lovin' ain't the same
I don't know what to say, but
What a shame
If you were mine you would not get the same
If you were mine you would top everything
Suicide in the drop switchin' lanes
And that thing so fire, baby, no propane
Got good pussy, girl, can I be frank?
To keep it one-hundred, girl, I ain't no saint
But he the only reason that I'm feelin' this way
Givin' you the world, baby, when you get space
Pen game get me laid, baby, that's penetrate
Oh baby

[Chorus]
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"

[Verse 1]
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

[Chorus]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

[Verse 2]
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

[Chorus]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

[Verse 3]
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

[Chorus]
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

New Kung Fu Kenny

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Throw a steak off the ark
To a pool full of sharks, he'll take it
Leave him in the wilderness
With a sworn nemesis, he'll make it
Take the gratitude from him
I bet he'll show you somethin', whoa
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothin'
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothin'
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothin'
I'll chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, "Bitch, I did that!"
X-rated
Johnny don't wanna go to school no mo', no mo'
Johnny said books ain't cool no mo' (no mo')
Johnny wanna be a rapper like his big cousin
Johnny caught a body yesterday out hustlin'
God bless America, you know we all love him
Yesterday I got a call like from my dog like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
Talkin' out his head, philosophin' on what the Lord had done
He said: "K-Dot, can you pray for me?
It been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome."
He was lookin' for some closure
Hopin' I could bring him closer
To the spiritual, my spirit do know better, but I told him
"I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel:
If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed."
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
I'll wait in front a niggas spot and watch him hit his block
I'll catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all I got
I'll chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, "Bitch, I did that!"
Ain't no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward
I can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours
It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird be on the street, paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my momma
Touch my sister, touch my woman
Touch my daddy, touch my niece
Touch my nephew, touch my brother
You should chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Matter fact, I'm 'bout to speak at this convention
Call you back—

[Break: Kendrick Lamar]
Alright, kids, we're gonna talk about gun control
(Pray for me) Damn!

[Chorus: Bono]
It's not a place
This country is to me a sound
Of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look around

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Hail Mary, Jesus and Joseph
The great American flag is wrapped in drag with explosives
Compulsive disorder, sons and daughters
Barricaded blocks and borders
Look what you taught us!
It's murder on my street, your street, back streets
Wall Street, corporate offices
Banks, employees, and bosses with
Homicidal thoughts; Donald Trump's in office
We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again
But is America honest, or do we bask in sin?
Pass the gin, I mix it with American blood
Then bash him in, you Crippin' or you married to blood?
I'll ask again — oops, accident
It's nasty when you set us up
Then roll the dice, then bet us up
You overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us
Gang members or terrorists, et cetera, et cetera
America's reflections of me, that's what a mirror does

[Chorus: Bono]
It's not a place
This country is to me a sound
Of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look ar—



[Verse 1]
I'll undress you, 'cause you're tired
Cover you as you desire
When you fall asleep inside my arms
May not have the fancy things
But I'll give you everything
You could ever want, it's in my arms

[Pre-Chorus]
So baby tell me yes
And I will give you everything
So baby tell me yes
And I will be all yours tonight
So baby tell me yes
And I will give you everything
I will be right by your side

[Chorus]
If I can't find the cure, I'll

No matter what you know, I'll
I'll fix you with my love
And if you say you're okay
I'm gonna heal you anyway
Promise I'll always be there
Promise I'll be the cure (be the cure)

[Verse 2]
Rub your feet, your hands, your legs
Let me take care of it, babe
Close your eyes, I'll sing your favorite song
I wrote you this lullaby
Hush now baby, don't you cry
Anything you want could not be wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
So baby tell me yes
And I will give you everything
So baby tell me yes
And I will be all yours tonight
So baby tell me yes
And I will give you everything
I will be right by your side

[Chorus]
If I can't find the cure, I'll

Promise I'll always be there
Promise I'll be the cure (be the cure)

[Bridge]
I'll fix you with my love
(I'll fix you with my love-lo-love)
I'll fix you with my love
(I'll fix you with my love-lo-love)

[Chorus]
If I can't find the cure, I'll
I'll fix you with my love
No matter what you know, I'll
I'll fix you with my love
And if you say you're okay
I'm gonna heal you anyway
Promise I'll always be there
Promise I'll be the cure (be the cure)
Promise I'll be the cure (be the cure)

[Outro]
I'll fix you with my love



[Chorus: Shawn Hook, Vanessa Hudgens & Both]
She keeps reminding me
That you’re still gone
And I’m still lonely
He keeps reminding me
How good it was
When we were crazy

[Verse 1: Shawn Hook]
Wine, she’s spitting out the wine
I forgot you left behind
Our favorite cherry red
Oh, love, I know this isn’t love
'Cause I’m still thinking of you
While she’s getting undressed
I never should have left

[Chorus: Shawn Hook]
She keeps reminding me
That you’re still gone
And I’m still lonely
She keeps reminding me
How good it was
When we were crazy

[Post-Chorus: Shawn Hook]
In love, love
She keeps reminding me
How good it was, was
She keeps reminding me

[Verse 2: Vanessa Hudgens]
Nights, I miss the faded nights
Staying out 'til morning light
Having breakfast in bed
Now he, he's laying in the sheets
The ones you bought for me
All tangled in a mess
It should be you instead

[Chorus: Shawn Hook & Vanessa Hudgens]
He keeps reminding me
That you’re still gone
And I’m still lonely
He keeps reminding me how good it was
When we were crazy

[Post-Chorus]
In love, love
He keeps reminding me
How good it was, was
He keeps reminding me

[Bridge: Shawn Hook & Vanessa Hudgens]
Well, I’m tryna forget you with no regrets
But I’m still hanging onto the memories that you left
I deleted your number with every text
I’m still tryna forget you, forget you

[Chorus: Shawn Hook, Vanessa Hudgens & Both]
She keeps reminding me
That you’re still gone
And I’m still lonely
He keeps reminding me
How good it was
When we were crazy
She keeps reminding me
That you’re still gone
And I’m still lonely
He keeps reminding me
How good it was
When we were crazy

[Post-Chorus: Shawn Hook & Vanessa Hudgens]
In love, love
She keeps reminding me
How good it was, was
She keeps reminding me

[Outro: Shawn Hook]
Wine, she’s spitting out the wine
I forgot you left behind

[Verse 1]
This what happen when I think 'bout you
I get in my feelings, yeah
I start reminiscing, yeah
Next time around, fuck, I want it to be different, yeah
Waiting on a sign, guess it's time for a different prayer
Lord, please save her for me, do this one favor for me
I had to change my player ways, got way too complicated for me
I hope she's waiting for me
Everywhere she go they playin' my song
That's why I say the things that I say
That way I know you can't ignore me
But so, so (Yeah)

[Hook]
So give me all of you in exchange for me
Just give me all of you in exchange for me, for me

[Break 1]
Break it down, yeah
Yes sir
Check

[Verse 2]
We used to lay up and then stay up
Have sex and then blow dank
I shouldn't have played no games with you, just leveled-up my rank
Last time I saw you we ain't speak, that was strange
Guess it's nothing I can do, man, it's true, exes change, yeah
Aye, guess you changed for the better (better!)
I know you know how to make me jealous
I was never loyal, let you tell it, yo
But I'm ready to fix it if you ready, baby
But so, so (Yeah)

[Hook]
So give me all of you in exchange for me
Just give me all of you in exchange for me, for me

[Break 2]
For real shawty
You already know

[Verse 3]
Yeah, is you at Two Keys or Tin Roof?
Turn up with young Tiller, we just gettin' loose
Maybe I'm lowkey feelin' you, don't be cynical
Won’t fuck you over, wanna fuck you over and again
The truth is I ain't really here to start problems
Girl, I swear to God them hoes can't never say they got him
Know how bad you wanna tell 'em, "don't try him"
I don't wanna tell 'em, let's surprise 'em
I don't wanna get into it – why you stressin' him? I've been drivin'
Back and forth, from Louisville to Lexington, mileage
On the whip, got your ass in my grip
College make you wanna strip for them dollars
Nah girl, I got a job for you, swear to God I can do a lot for you
Saw you strollin' through the campus, I had to stop for you
I was scrollin' through the 'gram, girl, I had to follow you
Say what's up with you?
You got my soul



[Verse 1]
I think she love me, 'cause I got the check on me
Wan' spend the day and flex on me
Put a curse and hex on me
Scratch out my name, put the X on me
You should come check on me
Talk dirty and caress on me
Fuck it, might as well get undressed for me
Love how you get that pussy wet for me
Put a lot of stress on me
You used to obsess for me
Call the station and request for me
You done went and got a big head on me

[Chorus]
You're running me dry
Oh girl, you're running me dry
Cried my last tear drop
Saw bad when I told her "Bring it here"
Drop down, pick it up up up
Swing it around, Imma go go go
Drop that, down, Imma pick it up up up
Swing it around, Imma go go go
Oh, you tryna roll
Let's go
Let's go, oh yeah
Oh, you're the reason I even
Saw bad when I told her "Bring it here"
Drop down, pick it up up up
Swing it around, Imma go go go
Drop that, down Imma pick it up up up
Swing it around, Imma go go go

[Verse 2]
Aye, aye, aye, aye
Used to break my neck for you
Spend my paycheck on you
Put my account in the red for you
Damn near put myself in debt for you
You made me obsessed for you
Thought I had the same effect on you
Couldn't see I was the best for you
Now you gotta figure out what's next for you
Now you feel regret, oh, do you?
Baby, I could care less for you
Trust, I'm not even sweating you
You ran me dry, bet it gets to you (Oh yeah)
Out of respect for you
I curved bitches on the internet for you
I lost all respect for you
Baby, it's my turn to flex on you

[Chorus]
You're running me dry
Oh girl, you're running me dry
Cried my last tear drop
Saw bad when I told 'em bring it here
Drop down, pick it up up up
Swing it around, Imma go, go, go
Drop that, down, Imma pick it up, up, up
Swing it around, Imma go, go, go
Oh, you tryna roll
Let's go
Let's go, yeah
Oh, you're the reason I even
Saw bad when I told her bring it here
Drop down, pick it up, up, up
Swing it around, Imma go, go, go
Drop that, down Imma pick it up, up, up
Swing it around, Imma go, go, go



[Verse 1]
And you got me like, "Oh, what you want from me?"
(What you want from me?)
And I tried to buy your pretty heart, but the price too high
Baby you got me like "Oh"
You love when I fall apart (fall apart)
So you can put me together and throw me against the wall

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby you got me like i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-hiii, woo i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-hiii
Don't you stop loving me (loving me)
Don't quit loving me (loving me)
Just start loving me (loving me)
Owwwwww

[Chorus]
And babe I’m fist-fighting with fire
Just to get close to you
Can we burn something babe
And I run for miles just to get a taste
Must be love on the brain
That’s got me feeling this way
It beats me black and blue but it fucks me so good
And I can’t get enough
Must be love on the brain yeah
And it keeps cursing my name
No matter what I do
I’m no good without you
And I can’t get enough
Must be love on the..... brain

[Verse 2]
Baby keep loving me
Just love me
Yeah, just love me
All you need to do is love me, yeah
Got me like, ah-ha-ha-owww
I’m tired of being played like a violin
What do I gotta do to get in your motherfuckin’ heart?
Baby like i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-hiii, woo i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-hiii

[Pre-Chorus]

Just start loving me (loving me)
Ooooooohhh

[Chorus]
And babe I’m fist-fighting with fire
Just to get close to you
Can we burn something babe
And I run for miles just to get a taste
Must be love on the brain
That’s got me feeling this way
It beats me black and blue but it fucks me so good
And I can’t get enough
Must be love on the brain yeah
And it keeps cursing my name
No matter what I do
I’m no good without you
And I can’t get enough
Must be love on the.... brain

I am not the only traveler
Who has not repaid his debt
I've been searching for a trail to follow again
Take me back to the night we met

And then I can tell myself
What the hell I'm supposed to do
And then I can tell myself
Not to ride along with you

I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Take me back to the night we met

When the night was full of terrors
And your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet
Oh, take me back to the night we met

I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Take me back to the night we met



[Verse 1]
When you feel the world around you
Spinnin' out of control
You can find someone around you
To bring you out of the cold
But you don't ever have to hide
What you really feel inside

[Chorus]
So put 'em up
Two high
We can walk together with our hands up in the sky
So put 'em up
Tonight
We can come together
We won't give up on the fight

[Post-Chorus]
Woah-ooh
So put 'em up
Put 'em up
Two high

[Verse 2]
Sometimes it's hard to tell
What we're really living for
Hear the voices calling out from the streets
Singin' get ready
Get ready for more
Singin' get ready
Get ready for more now

[Chorus]
So put 'em up
Two high
We can walk together with our hands up in the sky
So put 'em up
Tonight
We can come together
We won't give up on the fight

[Post-Chorus]
Woah-ooh
So put 'em up
Put 'em up
Two high
Put 'em up
Put 'em up
Two high

[Bridge]
Before we're gone
Keep holding on
Keep holding on

And put 'em up
Two high
We can walk together with our hands up in the sky
So put 'em up
Tonight
We can come together
We won't give up on the fight
So put 'em up
Two high
We can walk together with our hands up in the sky
So put 'em up
Tonight
We can come together
We won't give up on the fight

[Verse]
Young nigga, I got old cash, spazzin' on they ass
I got Prada on my hoe ass, got my last one mad
Pop a nigga like a damn tag, shoppin' on they ass
I just bought a new old Jag, yeah, it's so fast
Smokin' flocka, you a jackass, all I smoke is gas

I ain't talking 'bout my niggas, dammit, but y'all tripping, too
Is it you? Damn, my nigga, what the hell got into you?
Project Baby, y'all was skipping in the hallway, I was skipping school
On my Ps and Qs,  on them jiggas, call me jiggaboo
Bleeding concrete, bet you niggas won't come cross the street
Pardon me, I don't talk to you, so don't you talk to me
I ain't dissing on nobody B, I'm vibing on the beat
Honestly, I'm just trying to be, I just gotta be
Trying to get over on anything, they telling lies to me
I spent five on my pinky ring, she love my diamond ring
Anyway, I'm married to the game, she said her vows to me
I ain't getting on my knees, bae, you bow down to me
You go down for me, you lay down and do the time for me
Sorry, boo, yeah, I lie to you, but don't you lie to me
It's little Kodak, the finesse kid, boy who hot as me?
Told the doctor I'm a healthy kid, I smoke broccoli
I will run around your whole board like Monopoly
Ol' boy, you's a broke boy, flocka's got you beat
Chocolate, call me Reese's, can't catch me without the piece
C'est la vie, I'm ten toes down, you falling off your feet
I will trick your ass for a treat, call it Halloween
Yeah, that money's what I play for, call it lottery
Goddamn, you's a clown to me, you's a clown to me
You can't smoke no Black & Mild with me, get in the car with me
You a funny guy, don't you even joke around with me
How could it be? Get from 'round a G, you grounded from me
I'm a freeband junkie, you a junkie
You getting skinny, I'm getting chunky, getting money
Want some food? Boy, you hungry, I want them hundreds, hundreds



[Verse 1]
I do my makeup in somebody else's car
We order different drinks at the same bars
I know about what you did and I wanna scream the truth
She thinks you love the beach, you're such a damn liar

[Refrain]
Well those great whites, they have big teeth
Hope they bite you
Thought you said that you would always be in love
But you're not in love no more
Did it frighten you
How we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?
On the light up floor

[Pre-Chorus]
But I hear sounds in my mind
Brand new sounds in my mind
But honey I'll be seein' you wherever I go
But honey I'll be seein' you down every road
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

[Chorus]
'Cause honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, I wish I could get my things and just let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I wake up in a different bedroom
I whisper things, the city sings 'em back to you

[Refrain]
Well those rumors, they have big teeth
Hope they bite you
Thought you said that you would always be in love
But you're not in love no more
Did it frighten you
How we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?
On the light up floor

[Pre-Chorus]
But I hear sounds in my mind
Brand new sounds in my mind
But honey I'll be seein' you wherever I go
But honey I'll be seein' you down every road
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

[Chorus]
'Cause honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Yes, honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, I wish I could get my things and just let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

[Outro]
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it



[Intro]
2, 3, 4

[Verse 1]
The hard part always seems to last forever
Sometimes I forget that we aren't together
Deep down in my heart, I hope you're doing alright
But from time to time I often think of why you aren't mine

[Chorus]
But I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that no one else
Is gonna hold you down the way that I do

[Verse 2]
Now, I can't say I'll be alright without you
And I can't say that I haven't tried to
But, all your stuff is gone
I erased all the pictures from my phone
Of me and you
Heres what I'll do

[Chorus]
I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that no one else
Is gonna hold you down the way that I do

[Bridge]
I hope you think of all the times we shared
I hope you'll finally realize I was the only one who cared
It's crazy how this love thing seems unfair
You won't find a love like mine anywhere

[Chorus]
But I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that no one else
Is gonna hold you down the way that I do
But I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that I'm finally over you
I'm finally over you

I'm sorry, I'm not the most pretty
I'll never ever sing like Whitney
Ooh, but I still wanna dance with somebody (Tunechi)

[Verse 1: Bebe Rexha & Lil Wayne]

Every time she dance it's exotic
Throw a bunch of bands arms get tired

Kiss both boobs right before I sign 'em
Can't dance but kinda grind 'em

We can turn this dance floor to a island

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha & Lil Wayne]
I just wanna dance with somebody (Mula)

[Intro: Machine Gun Kelly]
Ayy
Woke up in, woke up in
Soundin' real godly
Quavo
Sonny rollin' grams of wax (yeh)

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Woke up in Paris
Broke all the mirrors (what that mean?)
Must mean, last night was too turnt
They caught me fucking on camera

Pull up, back home, flag on, tats out
What the fuck is that 'bout?
I'm home-bred, hometown
Been around the world, I'm back now
I'm Mr. Miyagi with wax in the sake
And I'm running the streets of the city like Rocky
Who da champ? Who da champ?
Diamond fangs like a vamp
Where's the package with the stamp?
Bust it open by the lamp
Roll it up 'till I cramp
Uh, four rings on my hands, uh
Smoke rings from the grams , uh
Got a lady and a tramp
Bitch I made it from the trap
Gunner

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
I woke up in Paris
In the bed, with a bad bitch (bad bitch, bad bitch)
First, I roll up the lettuce
Then I went back for seconds
Swear that pussy the wettest
I woke up in Paris
In the bed, with a bad bitch (bad bitch, bad bitch)
First, I roll up the lettuce
Then I went back for seconds
Swear that pussy the wettest

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Made it from the bottom
What you thinking of me? (what you thinking)
I made it from the bottom
What you thinking of me? (what you thinking)
When I was on the bottom
You didn't hang out with me (no way)
Now I got some dollars
They keep hanging with me (yeah)
Take a lot of Molly, that's your fantasy (that's your fantasy)
Pull up with the gang and stop playing with me (stop playing)
You took too much of Coco
It made your nose bleed (trippin)
Too turnt for the bando (too)
Shoot two times through the window (shoot)
Pop one off with a kick though (pop one)
Pop one off this endo (shoot)
Old money like a Nintendo
Bring it back home, this the reload (bring back)
Crips mights call it a kilo (crip)
Bloods might call it a bilo (blood)
Put my wrist in a freezer (wrist)
Heat it up, turn it up to beast mode (yeah)
Bitch, I made it from the trap (trap)
Whole thang in my lap
Bitch, I made it from the trap (trap)
Got your girl in my lap (yeah)

[Verse 1]
Baby last night was hands down
One of the best nights that I've had, no doubt
Between the bottle of wine and the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love

[Chorus 1]
If I never get to see the Northern lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man
A happy man baby

[Verse 2]
And baby that red dress brings me to my knees
Oh but that black dress makes it hard to breathe
You’re a saint, you’re a goddess, the cutest, the hottest, a masterpiece
It's too good to be true, nothing better than you in the wildest dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love

[Chorus 1]
If I never get to see the Northern lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man, yeah

[Bridge]
I don't need no vacation, no fancy destination
Baby you're my great escape
We could stay at home, listen to the radio
Or dance around the fireplace

[Chorus 2]
Oh if I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
Or drive a sports car up the coast of California
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man

[Post-Chorus]
Baby I could die a happy man
Oh I could die a happy man
You know I could die
I could die, I could die a happy man



[Verse 1: Florida Georgia Line]
May we all get to grow up in our red white and blue little town
Get a won't start hand me down Ford to try to fix up
With some part time cash from driving a tractor
Find a sweet little thang, wears your ball cap backwards
Kinda place you can't wait to leave but nobody does
Cause you miss it too much

[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line]
May we all know that nothing ain't cool 'til you wear the new off
The sound of a quarter rollin' down a jukebox
Play the Travis Tritt right above the 2Pac
Hope you get lost down some road
Slow rolling with the top off the back of a Bronco
Buy a cold sixer with a cashed in lotto
She's smilin' with her hair blowing out the window
Where you 'bout to go?
Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall
May we all

[Verse 2: Tim McGraw]
May we all get to see those fields of green turn gold
Watch a marching band play with the harvest moon coming up
And know that fifteen minutes of famous
Ain't gonna be what makes us or breaks us but
We'll all be watching the TV the day that it comes

[Chorus: Tim McGraw]
May we all know that nothing ain't cool 'til you wear the new off
The sound of a quarter rollin' down a jukebox
Play the Travis Tritt right above the 2Pac
'Fore you get lost down some road
Slow rolling with the top off the back of a Bronco
Buy a cold sixer with a cashed in lotto
She's smilin' with her hair blowing out the window
Where you 'bout to go?
Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall
May we all

[Verse 3: Both]
May we all do a little bit better than the first time
Learn a little something from the worst times
Get a little stronger from the hurt times
May we all get to have a chance to ride the fast one
Walk away wiser when we crashed one
Keep hoping that the best one is the last one

[Outro]
Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall
May we all
May we all
May we all
May we all
May we all
May we all (get to have a chance to ride the fast one)
May we all (walk away wiser when we crashed one)
May we all (keep hoping that the best one is the last one)
(yeah the last one)
Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall
May we all



[Justin Bieber]
Everybody gets high sometimes
You know
What else can we do when
We're feeling low


So take a deep breath
And let it go
You shouldn't be
Drowning on your own


And if you feel you're sinking
I will jump right over
Into cold, cold
Water for you


And although time may take us
Into different places
I will still be
Patient with you


And I hope you know
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline, tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline, tonight


Cause we all get lost
Sometimes you know
It's how we learn
And how we grow


And I wanna lay with
Until I'm old
You shouldn't be fighting
On your own


And if you feel you're sinking
I will jump right over
Into cold, cold
Water for you


And although time may take us
Into different places
I will still be
Patient with you


And I hope you know
I won't let go (I won't let go, no, no, no more)
I'll be your lifeline, tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline, tonight

[MØ]
Come on, Come on
Save me from the rocking boat
I just wanna stay afloat
I'm all alone


And I hope, I hope
Someone's gonna take me home
Somewhere I can rest my soul (rest my soul)
I need to know, you won't let go


[Justin Bieber]
(I won't let go, no, no, no more)
I'll be your lifeline, tonight
[MØ]
You won't let go


[Justin Bieber]
I'll be your lifeline, tonight
I won't let go
I won't let go, go



[Verse 1]
It's electric how my lipstick
Makes its own way right into your kiss, and
It's pathetic how we both get
Kinda fucked up, hanging on each other
We're ahead now, should we slow down?
Should we slow down now?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm getting some kind of shake without you

[Chorus]
Uh-huh! I think you're movin' in too close
But I think that it's my body wanting it the most, like
Uh-huh! I don't know what it is I feel
But I know it's my emotions going in for the kill, like

[Hook]
Uh-huh! (Uh-huh!) Uh-huh! (Uh-huh!)
But I know it's my emotions going in for the kill

[Verse 2]
It's electric how symmetric
We both get when you lay beside me
It's phonetic how our mouths grip
Almost too tight to the words we're sayin'
We're in deep now, should we slow down?
Should we slow down now?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm getting some kind of shake without you

[Chorus]
Uh-huh! I think you're movin' in too close
But I think that it's my body wanting it the most, like
Uh-huh! I don't know what it is I feel
But I know it's my emotions going in for the kill, like

[Hook]
Uh-huh! (Uh-huh!) Uh-huh! (Uh-huh!)
But I know it's my emotions going in for the kill, like
Uh-huh! (Uh-huh!) Uh-huh! (Uh-huh!)
But I know it's my emotions going in for the kill

[Post-Chorus]
Goin' in for the kill
Goin' in for the kill

[Bridge]
It's rare when the panic in my mind
Feel so damn good
Woo!

[Chorus]
Uh-huh! I think you're movin' in too close
But I think that it's my body wanting it the most, like
Uh-huh! I don't know what it is I feel
But I know it's my emotions going in for the kill, like

[Hook]
Uh-huh! (Uh-huh!) Uh-huh! (Uh-huh!)
But I know it's my emotions going in for the kill, like
Uh-huh! (Uh-huh!) Uh-huh! (Uh-huh!)
But I know it's my emotions going in for the kill

[Outro]
Goin' in for the kill
Goin' in for the kill
Uh-huh!

Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, yeah

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
If I'ma talk, I'ma talk, I'ma keep it real
Me and my boys, and my boys, we would split a pill
Noodles and pots in a pot was a nigga meal
Now that we on, that we on, we gon' split a mill'
I take a jet, take a jet when I'm overseas
None of my girls, of my girls gon' get over me
Shout-out to Hawk, shout-out Dooly, shout-out Hennessy
Them be my bros, be my bros 'til the death of me
Nobody, nobody know how I really be
I got some bars for a nigga if he wanna see
Dress up your talk if a nigga wanna talk to me
Fuck your phone calls, I don't want apologies
Everyone said, yeah, they said I was gonna peak
Most number ones, number ones in a nigga league
I think your girl, think your girl, fell in love with me
She say my fuck, and my tongue game a remedy

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Oh yeah, yeah
I just hit a lick, and I know you feelin' some way
(Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)

She just want a nigga like me, you feelin' some way, way, way
She just want a nigga like me, I play no

[Verse 2: Nav]
Way, we got 'em feelin' some way
Way, 'cause you see XO in the place, told her, "Wait"
I gotta get myself together, it's a date
I spent two thousand on a sweater, way
I think the belts inside the store look better on my waist
I think my nuts look better on her face
This bitch got addicted, all she did was take a taste
Now you gettin' mad because you got replaced
The brown boy and the Starboy on a track
Haters gonna say "this shit is wack"
I went to the hills straight from the trap
I'ma fuck your bitch and give her back
She said she pop pills, I told her "Stop it"
Check my little pocket, I got options
I'm the first brown boy to get it poppin'
If I say the word, my shooters gonna pop 'em

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Oh yeah, yeah
I just hit a lick, and I know you feelin' some way
(Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
I just took that chick, and I know you feelin' some way, oh yeah
She just want a nigga like me, you feelin' some way, way, way
She just want a nigga like me, I play no games



[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Look, open your eyes, déjà vu
In ways I knew my focus remains on you
I'm so true, I love that, 'cause who woulda knew?
LBC, me? Do what it do
Question: is your bath water ready for ya?
'Cause I could be the man for ya
Baby, are your bills paid?
Were those dinner reservations made?
The whistles, the bells, how 'bout your hair?
What about your nails?
See I can have it done for ya
Looks like I'm the one for ya
I'll crack the whip
And get a little action in here, my dear
But first, relax a bit
The questions and answers are clear

[Chorus: John Legend]
A holiday
What you wanna do? Want to do with you
Let's make everyday a holiday
What you wanna do? Want to do with you

She say Rodeo, I say I'm thinking 'bout Tokyo (Tokyo)
With the top gone, won't turn up the stereo (stereo)
Singing every word of my song that's on radio (aye)

Sit back, let your mind float (phew) never give up hope (no)
And if ya got a problem, let me know (let me know)

But y'all know (but y'all know)

[Verse 1]
She grew up around here, on that southwest side
Where the corn grows, up to the road side
Went to high school here, got that Panther pride
She'll be cheering them on every Friday night

[Verse 2]
She couldn't hide her beauty with a baseball cap
Couldn't help but shine with a heart like that
New York called when she turned 21
But she never forgot, where she came from

[Chorus]
I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl

[Verse 3]
Her mamma's mamma was born right here
And her roots run deeper than that old town square
She's a good girl, but she's not uptight
She can rise and shine and she can hang all night

[Chorus]
I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
She's got an old soul
She's the salt of the earth
When she gives her love she knows what it's worth
There's a lot of pretty girls out there to me
But there's nothing like the one right across the street

[Chorus]
I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl

[Outro]
I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl ...



[Verse 1]
What's with the drugs (these days?)
These days I don't feel nothin'
Unless our bodies touchin', babe
Losin' my buzz, on no
Go get the bartender
Fix me up something better, babe

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I can't get high
No, I can't get high no, no, no
No, I can't get high
No, I can't get high

[Chorus]
I can't get high without your love
I can't get high without your love
All of these drugs, they ain't enough
They don't do what your body does
I can't get high without your love
I can't get high without your love
All of these drugs, they ain't enough
I can't get high without your love

[Post-Chorus]
I can't get high, oh no, oh no
I can't get high without your love

[Verse 2]
You got me on one, uh-huh
Now you're the only reason

What's up with the drugs? They don't
No, they don't feel the same
Ain't callin' my dealer
'Cause I got you feelin' my body, babe (my body, babe)

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I can't get high
No, I can't get high, no, no, no
No, I can't get high
No, I can't get high

What's up with the drugs?
These days, these days
You got me on one
I can't, I can't

[Chorus]
I can't get high without your love
I can't get high without your love
All of these drugs, they ain't enough
They don't do what your body does
I can't get high without your love
I can't get high without your love
All of these drugs, they ain't enough
I can't get high without your love

[Outro]
(I can't get high without your love)
I need it so bad, I need it so bad
I'm never sober, I need it, I need it
I need it so bad, I need it so bad
I'm never sober, I need it, I need it
(So good, I need it so bad)
(So good, I need it so bad)



[Verse 1: Keith Urban]
I know he hurt you
Made you scared of love, too scared to love
He didn't deserve you
Cause your precious heart is a precious heart
He didn't know what he had and I thank God, oh, oh, oh
And it's gonna take just a little time
But you're gonna see that I was born to love you

[Chorus: Keith Urban and Carrie Underwood]
What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you baby I'll be the fighter
What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I promise I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you baby I'll be the fighter

[Verse 2: Keith Urban]
Look in the mirror
You're beautiful, so beautiful
I'm here to remind you
You're my only one, let me be the one
To heal all the pain that he put you through
It's a love like you never knew
Just let me show you

[Chorus: Keith Urban and Carrie Underwood]
What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?

When they're tryna get to you baby I'll be the fighter
What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I promise, I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you baby I'll be the fighter

I wanna believe that you got me baby
I swear I do from now until the next life
I wanna love, wanna give you all my heart

[Chorus: Keith Urban and Carrie Underwood]
What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you baby I'll be the fighter
What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I promise I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you baby I'll be the fighter

[Outro: Keith Urban and Carrie Underwood]
What if I fall?
What if I cry?
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you baby I'll be the fighter



[MOANA]
There's a line where the sky meets the sea and it calls me
But no one knows, how far it goes
All the time wondering where I need to be is behind me
I'm on my own, to worlds unknown

Every turn I take, every trail I track
Is a choice I make, now I can't turn back
From the great unknown where I go alone
Where I long to be

See her light up the night in the sea, she calls me
And yes I know that I can go
There's a moon in the sky and the wind is behind me
Soon I'll know how far I'll go



[Intro: Sean Paul]
Call it love and devotion
Call it a mom's adoration, foundation
A special bond of creation, hah
For all the single moms out there
Going through frustration
Clean Bandit, Sean-da-Paul, Anne-Marie
Sing, make them hear

[Verse 1: Anne-Marie & Sean Paul]
She works at nights, by the water
She's gone astray, so far away
From her father's daughter
She just wants a life for her baby
All on her own, no one will come
She's got to save him (daily struggle)

[Pre-Chorus 1: Anne-Marie & Sean Paul]
She tells him, "Oh, love, no one's ever gonna hurt you, love."
"I'm gonna give you all of my love."
"Nobody matters like you."
(Stay up there, stay up there!)
She tells him, "Your life ain't gon' be nothing like my life." (Straight!)
"You're gonna grow and have a good life."
"I'm gonna do what I've got to do."
(Stay up there, stay up there!)

[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
So, rockabye, baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye, baby, don't you cry
Somebody's got you
Rockabye, baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye, baby, don't you cry
Ah, Rockabye, no

[Post-Chorus 1: Sean Paul & Anne-Marie]
Rockabye, rocka-rocka-rocka-bye
(Rockabye, yeah, yeah)
Rockabye, rocka-rocka-rocka-bye

[Verse 2: Sean Paul & Anne-Marie]
Single mum, how're you doing out there?
Facing the hard life, without no fear (Yeah!)
Just so you know that you really care
'Cause any obstacle come, you're well prepared (Oh, no!)
And no, mama, you never shed tear
'Cause you have to shed things year after year
And you give the yout love beyond compare (Yeah!)
You find his school fee and the bus fare (Yeah!)
Mh, Marie, the paps' disappear
In the wrong bar, can't find him nowhere
Steadily your workflow, heavily you know
So your non-stop, no time, no time for ya dear

[Bridge: Anne-Marie]
Now she got a six-year-old
Trying to keep him warm
Trying to keep out the cold
When he looks in her eyes
He don't know he is safe

[Pre-Chorus 2: Anne-Marie]
When she says, "Oh, love, no one's ever gonna hurt you, love."
"I'm gonna give you all of my love."
"Nobody matters like you."

[Chorus: Anne-Marie & Sean Paul]
So, rockabye, baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye, baby, don't you cry
Somebody's got you
Rockabye, baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye, baby, don't you cry
(Badda-bang-bang-bang, alright then)
Ah, Rockabye, no

[Post-Chorus 2: Sean Paul & Anne-Marie]
Rockabye, rocka-rocka-rocka-bye
(Rockabye, yeah, yeah)
Rockabye, rocka-rocka-rocka-bye
Rockabye, don't bother cry
Lift up your head, lift it up to the sky, yo
Rockabye, don't bother cry
Angels surround you, just dry your eye

[Bridge: Anne-Marie]
Now she got a six-year-old
Trying to keep him warm
Trying to keep out the cold
When he looks in her eyes
He don't know he is safe when she says

[Pre-Chorus 1: Anne-Marie & Sean Paul]
She tells him, "Oh, love, no one's ever gonna hurt you, love."
"I'm gonna give you all of my love."
"Nobody matters like you."
(Stay up there, stay up there!)
She tells him, "Your life ain't gon' be nothing like my life." (Straight!)
"You're gonna grow and have a good life."
"I'm gonna do what I got to do.", yeah

[Chorus: Anne-Marie & Sean Paul]
So, rockabye, baby, rockabye
(Rockabye, rocka-rocka-rocka-bye)

[Post-Chorus 3: Sean Paul & Anne-Marie]
Rockabye, don't bother cry
Lift up your head, lift it up to the sky (Ah, Rockabye!)
Rockabye, don't bother cry (Yeah!)
Angels surround you, just dry your eye (Yeah, ah, rockabye!)
Rockabye, don't bother cry (No!)
Lift up your head, lift it up to the sky (Oh, Rockabye!)

And I'm playing the field, Brad Wingin the punt

Whips in immigration, everything on them is custom
Now they calling me Billy, I'm the goat
No Achilles heel since I left Philly

Beep beep beep beep, put the hurt on me
Yeah, I'm wearing jeans, but he put the skrt on me
Rode him to sleep, and then I put his shirt on me
Pussy clean, these niggas ain't got no dirt on me
Gotta play it by my rules or I swerve on him
Bout my cash money, you can ask Bird or Slim
Took him to my paradise, silk ribbon my linen
Now he got a big thing for Caribbean women

Beep beep, babe, I need you to skrt on me, babe
Drop down low; Said you know I need to know
'Cause you keep telling me your love ain't free, babe

Scrolling through these mother fucking texts
They ain't say nothing but the same shit
Put that shit on do not disturb
Bitch I'm in the studio
Three in the morning I'm on "do not disturb"
My last little fling I put that shit in the dirt
Pop out the car screamin'

[Chorus]
I can hear my ex calling
Don't know why my ex calling
Why the fuck my ex calling
Don't know why my ex calling

Hold up why my ex calling
Don't know why my ex calling
Why the fuck my ex calling

[Bridge]
I can see my ex calling
Oh no, now my next calling
I don't know why I stress all 'em
I just want the best out 'em

[Verse 1]
We been through some things yeah
Thought I could restrain ya
I don't wanna tame ya
Impossible to change ya
Every time I try to put the fire out it boosts the flames up
You text me like I called ya
Well I don't mean to stall ya
But I cannot afford ya
So I gotta ignore ya
Cause I just want to ball yeah and you just want to fall yeah
I pick up my phone what the heck
Coming at my neck
Tripping via text disrespect
I don't fuck with that
Can't put me in check
You the ex calling for the sex
Want me cause I'm next
I'm the future where the Percocets

[Bridge]
I can see my ex calling
Oh no, now my next calling
I don't know why I stress all 'em

[Verse 2]
There's something wrong with my hand
Can't pick up the phone, goddamn
Hope you understand
I can't have you fuck up the plans
And if you gotta choose then you better choose the other man
See I weighed out that good side and that bad side so I'm done
I broke it down it was crunch time got focused and we won
Your favorite rapper gon want to join it the dream team and we come
Don't do this shit just for fun
Do this shit just to run
Run it back like a punt
Run that shit like Chris Breez'
All these hoes is on me
All this ice on me
All these lights on me
Not really, I like to stay lowkey
But still all that vice is on me
Never been 'bout that bird talk
To me that's that absurd talk
Always been 'bout the splurge talk
Back when we used to Bird Walk
And knocked off of my course man that one time and I  swear
I never wanna go there
That's unless she got nice brown skin good credit man and long hair

[Bridge]
I can see my ex calling
Oh no, now my next calling
I don't know why I stress all 'em
I just want the best out 'em

[Chorus]

Why the fuck my ex calling
Don't know why my ex calling
I can see my ex calling
Hold up why my ex calling
Don't know why my ex calling
Why the fuck my ex calling



[Verse 1: Drake]
Your heart is hard to carry after dark
You're to blame for what we could have been
'Cause look at what we are
Your friends are scared to tell you, you went too far
Funny that it's always been all about you from the start
I met someone new last night and we kicked it
And I'm going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind, this time
Going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?

[Verse 2: Drake]
Out of body
That's just how I feel when I'm around you, shawty
Last night we didn't say it
But girl, we both thought it
Why second guess? I should have stayed
You say the word, I'm on the way
This shit feels like teenage fever
I'm not scared of it, she ain't either
Why second guess? I should have stayed
'Cause you know what's on my mind tonight

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?

[Outro: Santan Dave]

Number one like I'm McGrady
Boy you said that you made me
Go ahead make another one
Do what I want cause I'm trusting none
I'ma love her, till the love is done
Took your girl, she ain't try to run
Hit from the back, so her legs get numb
Hit from the back so long
That my own legs starting to get numb
Suckin' me up, give me brain now she dumb
Tell her it's repercussions
Play her just like a drum
Make in a night what you make in a month

[Chorus]
Back then they napped on me
Now they all just act homie
Now I'm hot they all on me
Pull out the Snapchats on me
I ain't got no Snapchat homie
I think it's too personal
That's what I got Twitter for
Instagram I'll bag ya hoe
Back then they napped on me
Now they all just act homie
Now I'm hot they all on me
Pull out the Snapchats on me
I ain't got no Snapchat homie
I think it's too personal
That's what I got Twitter for
Instagram I'll bag ya hoe
Back then they napped on me
Now they all just act homie
Now I'm hot they all on me
Pull out the Snapchats on me
I ain't got no Snapchat homie
I think it's too personal
That's what I got Twitter for
Instagram I'll bag ya hoe

[Verse 2]
Boy you said that you made me
Go ahead make another one
Do what I want cause I'm trusting none
I'ma love her, till the love is done
Took your girl, she ain't try to run
Hit from the back, so her legs get numb
Hit from the back so long, that my own legs starting to get numb (skrrt)

[Pre-Chorus]
Know I walk with the racks on me
Bad bitch want back back
And you know she throw that ass on me
I don't want that girl cause
She want me cause the cash on me
Yeah, you know she cappin' homie
Dreadlock that cap on me

[Chorus]
Back then they napped on me
Now they all just act homie
Now I'm hot they all on me
Pull out the Snapchats on me

[Outro]
I ain't gone lie
The baddest girls do be on Snapchat
Finna make one



[Hook: PnB Rock]
I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won’t get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won’t get back
Yeah I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don’t think about the times
I wish that I could rewind

[Hook: PnB Rock]
‘Cause I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won’t get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won’t get back
Yeah I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don’t think about the times
I wish that I could rewind

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
I told my mama we gon’ be fine
So I’m up all night way after sleep time
I’m just thinkin’ ‘bout Lil Kuda
Gave my dog a dime
He put a buckshot in a nigga’s behind
No daddy so I grew up to the street life
But my son, I’ma keep him in the beehive
Scheming on a heist, I need to change my life
Been geekin’ all night, I’m going senile
With two niggas toting three 4-5’s
I seen a nigga play gangsta, then he broke down
Lost a lot, lost his mind in the courthouse
I’m on XXL, I’m in New York now

[Hook: PnB Rock]
‘Cause I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won’t get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won’t get back
Yeah I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don’t think about the times
I wish that I could rewind

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
I keep thinkin’ ‘bout my niggas
I think I need a jigga
I would keep on falling victim
Lost up in the system
Miss my brothers and my sisters
Damn I miss my lil one
I know sometimes I be tripping
But I just miss my niggas
I got codeine in my liver
I gave the judge a piece of me
I’m too street for the industry
But I think that’s where I need to be
‘Cause verbally, mentally, and physically I keep that heat
Me and my brother fit in
We smoking one with PnB
Niggas say they fuck with me
But lowkey they be easin' me
Bitches don’t mean shit to me
People tryna sentence me
How a youngin’ posted on the street, gon’ call it Sesame
1K ‘til the death of me, don’t put your life in jeopardy

[Hook: PnB Rock]
I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won’t get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won’t get back
Yeah I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don’t think about the times
I wish that I could rewind

[Chorus]
Don't you open up that window
Don't you let out that antidote (yah)
Poppin' pills is all we know (ooh)
In the hills is all we know (Hollywood)
Don't go through the front door (through the back)

So don't you open up that window (ooh)
Don't you let out that antidote (yah)

[Verse 1]
Party on a Sunday (that was fun)
Do it all again on Monday (one more time)
Spent a check on a weekend (oh my God)
I might do it all again (that's boss shit)
I just hit a three peat (ooh)
Fucked three hoes I met this week (Robert Horry)
I don't do no old hoes (oh, no, no)
My nigga, that's a no-no (straight up)
She just want the coco (cocaina)
I just want dinero (paper huntin', well)
Who that at the front door? (who that is?)
If it's the feds, oh, no, no, no (don't let 'em in, shhh)

[Chorus]
Don't you open up that window (yah)
Don't you let out that antidote (yah, ooh)
Poppin' pills is all we know (yah)

Bottles got us right though, we ain't sippin' light, no

Only got one night though, we can do it twice though

[Verse 3]
Stackin' up day to day, young nigga
You know you gotta go get it, go get it, my nigga
They hatin', they stankin', they waitin'
Don't be mistaken, we dyin', they stayin'
Lord, I'm on fire, they think that I'm Satan
Callin' me crazy on different occasions
Kickin' the cameraman off of my stages
'Cause I don't like how he snappin' my angles
I'm overboard and I'm over-impatient
Over my niggas and these kids my ages
Dealin' with Mo' shit that's more complicated
Like these two bitches that might be related
H-Town, you got one
And you Bun B like a number one
It's late night, got a late show
If you wanna roll, I got a place where...

[Chorus]
Poppin' pills is all we know (ooh)
In the hills is all we know (Hollywood)
Don't go through the front door (through the back)
It's lowkey at the night show (ooh)
So don't you open up that window (ooh)
Don't you let out that antidote
