I'm on the way, I know connection is vague
Pick up the phone for me, babe
Dammit, we jammin'
Bad attitude from yo' nanny
Curves and your hips from yo' mammy
Remember Gardena, I took the studio camera
I know Top will be mad at me
I had to do it, I want your body, your music
I bought the big one to prove it
Look what you made
Told you that I'm on the way
I'm like a exit away, yep

[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar & Zacari]
If I didn't ride blade on curve, would you still love me?
If I made up my mind at work, would you still love me?
Keep it a hundred, I'd rather you trust me than to love me
Keep it a whole one hund': don't got you, I got nothin'

[Chorus: Zacari & Kendrick Lamar]
Give me a run for my money
There is nobody, no one to outrun me
So give me a run for my money
Sippin' bubbly, feelin' lovely, livin' lovely
Just love me
I wanna be with you, ayy, I wanna be with
Just love me, just love me, just love me
I wanna be with you, ayy, I wanna be with
Love me
I wanna be with you
Love me, just love me



[Verse 1: Florida Georgia Line]
Baby, lay on back and relax
Kick your pretty feet up on my dash
No need to go​ nowhere fast
Let's enjoy right here where we at

[Pre-Chorus: Florida Georgia Line]
Who knows where this road is supposed to lead?
We got nothing, but time
As long as you're right here next to me, everything's gonna be alright

[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line]
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, just let it be
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, just let it be
So won't you ride with me, ride with me?
See, where this thing goes
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, if it's meant to be

[Verse 2: Bebe Rexha]
I don't mean to be so uptight
But my heart's been hurt a couple times
By a couple guys that didn't treat me right
I ain't gon' lie, ain't gon' lie
'Cause I'm tired of the fake love
Show me, what you're made of
Boy, make me believe

[Pre-Chorus: Florida Georgia Line]
But hold up, girl, don't you know you're beautiful?
And it's easy to see

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha & Florida Georgia Line]
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, just let it be
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, just let it be
So won't you ride with me, ride with me?
See, where this thing goes
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, if it's meant to be

[Post-Chorus: Bebe Rexha & Florida Georgia Line]
So c'mon, ride with me, ride with me
See, where this thing goes
So c'mon, ride with me, ride with me
See, where this thing goes
Baby, if it's meant to be

[Bridge: Bebe Rexha & Florida Georgia Line]
Maybe we do
Maybe we don't
Maybe we will
Maybe we won't

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha & Florida Georgia Line]
But if it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, just let it be (take it, baby)
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be (c'mon)
Baby, just let it be (let's go)
So won't you ride with me, ride with me?
See, where this thing goes
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, if it's meant to be

[Outro: Bebe Rexha & Florida Georgia Line]
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, if it's meant to be
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, if it's meant to be



[Verse 1]
Something must've gone wrong in my brain
Got your chemicals all in my veins
Feeling all the highs, feeling all the pain
Let go on the wheel, it’s the bullet lane
Now I'm seeing red, not thinking straight
Blurring all the lines, you intoxicate me

[Pre-Chorus]
Just like nicotine, heroin, morphine
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need, yeah, you're all I need

[Chorus]
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never ever, ever be the same

[Post-Chorus]
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same

[Verse 2]
Sneaking in L.A. when the lights are low
Off of one touch, I could overdose
You said, "stop playing it safe, girl, I wanna see you lose control"

[Pre-Chorus]
Just like nicotine, heroin, morphine
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need, yeah, you're all I need

[Chorus]
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never ever, ever be the same

[Post-Chorus]
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same

[Bridge]
You're in my blood, you're in my veins, you're in my head (I blame)
You're in my blood, you're in my veins, you're in my head (I'm sayin')

[Chorus]
I'm saying it's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame (you're to blame)
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same (I'll never be the...)
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never ever, ever be the same

You are now listening to a Bobby Johnson beat
What? Yeah, ayy, ayy

[Verse 1]
Pop the trunk, I open up, I sold my soul for a good price
Outta sight, and my hoe got talent, right?
Whole squad ran through that shit, yikes
Ayy, I’m a business man, I did my business, damn
But I'ma bend it down and I'ma lick her up, then dick her down
She gon' turn around then I'm gon' kick her out
She gon' talk that shit but say
How you make it up? How you fake a love?
Holy son, I was the chosen one
I'm sippin' out the grail, she gon' kiss and tell
She keep my wishes well (but) I don't need her, well
How my enemy a friend of me?
Why y'all feed off my energy? Like I ain't dead yet
Higher entity, foreign bitch that think she into me
Whip the foreign very viciously
Why these dudes wanna take pics with me?
She said she gay but still into me, said she gay but still into me
Said that she hates that I'm in the streets
And said that I hate that I'm in the streets
I wanna blow up or make history
And she said that she hate my Insta feed

[Chorus]
Xans don't make you
Xans gon' take you
Xans gon' fake you
And Xans gon' betray you
Xans don't make you
Xans gon' take you
Xans gon' fake you
Xans gon' betray you

[Verse 2]
And her pussy tastes like Skittles, what?
Yeah, ayy, and you can really taste the rainbow, what? (hah, no)
Yo' bitch just like a crayola (what, ayy)
You can draw her on the table, flip her like some yola
Heart shaped kisses, I really miss my mistress
666, evil bitches want my mentions
Heart shaped kisses, I really miss my mistress
And it's 666, evil bitches want my mentions

[Chorus]
Xans don't make you
Xans gon' take you
Xans gon' fake you
And Xans gon' betray you
Xans don't make you
Xans gon' take you
Xans gon' fake you
Xans gon' betray you

[Outro]
Xans gon' fake you
Xans gon' betray you
Xans gon' take you
Xans gon' betray you
Xans gon' take you
Xans gon' take you
What, ayy, what, ayy
Xans gon'—, xans gon' take you
Yeah, Xans gon'—

Xans' gon take you



[Intro]
Are you alright?

(yeah, yeah, yeah)
Countin' them bands
On my way to the top 'til we fallin' over

[Chorus]
I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you shoulda never lied

She said: "Baby, I am not afraid to die."
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge

[Verse 1]
Phantom that's all red, inside all white
Like somethin' you ride a sled down, I just want that head
My Brittany got mad, I'm barely her man now
Everybody got the same swag now
Watch the way that I tear it down
Stackin' my bands all the way to the top
All the way 'til my bands fallin' over
Every time that you leave your spot
Your girlfriend call me like, "Come on over!"
I like the way that she treat me
Gon' leave you, won't leave me, I call it that Casanova
She say I'm insane, yeah
I might blow my brain out (hey)
Xanny, help the pain, yeah
Please, Xanny, make it go away
I'm committed, not addicted, but it keep control of me
All the pain, now I can't feel it
I swear that it's slowin' me, yeah

[Chorus]
I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you shoulda never lied
Saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said: "I am not afraid to die."
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge (yeah)
All my friends are dead, yeah, ooh
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead, yeah
All my friends are dead, yeah

[Verse 2]
That is not your swag, I swear you fake hard
Now these niggas wanna take my cadence
Rain on 'em, thunderstorm, rain on 'em (ooh, yeah)
Medicine, lil' nigga, take some (yeh, yeh)
Fast car, NASCAR, race on 'em
In the club, ain't got no ones, then we would beg them
Clothes from overseas, got the racks and they all C-Notes
You is not a G though
Lookin' at you stackin' all your money, it all green though
I was countin' that and these all twenties, that's a G-roll

[Bridge]
She say: "You're the worst, you're the worst."
I cannot die because this my universe

[Chorus]
I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you shoulda never lied
Shoulda saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said: "Baby, I am not afraid to die."
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge



[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, mmm, ayy

[Chorus]
Candy paint with the white on top
Lambo doors are the oo-op drop
If you busy plotting on what I got
Kick in your door, that's SWAT you thot
Hundred thousand dollars on the table top
Half price my whip, same price my watch
Got no jumper but I ball a lot
Bitch, I'm young Stoney, I do what I want
Candy paint with the white on top (skrrt)
Lambo doors are the oo-op drop (drop)
If you busy plotting on what I got
Kick in your door, that's SWAT you thot (pop)
Hundred thousand dollars on the table top
Half price my whip, same price my watch (bling)
Got no jumper but I ball a lot (swish)
Bitch, I'm young Stoney, I do what I want

[Verse 1]
Didn't know that was your girl when she gave me top (yuh)
Kicked her out the Rolls said, "Thanks a lot"
Goddamn I love paper like I'm Michael Scott (yeah)
I can do things that your man cannot (yeah)
Slide boy comin' down, damn, I'm hot (hot)
Everybody say that I gotta be stopped (stopped)
Even though my final form ain't unlocked (locked)
I'm so ahead of you motherfuckers
How you comprehend what you ain't understanding?
Count a hundred bands and I watch it vanish
Diamonds going crazy like they on the dance floor
Got a lot of ass, nothing I can't handle

[Pre-Chorus]
Flavor lasts forever, you should try a sample (doddamn)
Baby, I'm the boss like I'm Tony Danza (Tony Danza)
Everybody trying to tell me what I stand for
But you don't fucking know me, homie, you don't want war (ayy)

[Chorus]
Candy paint with the white on top

Half price my whip, same price my watch (yeah)
Got no jumper but I ball a lot (swish)

[Verse 2]
I've been rolling twenty ash, hit the road (woo)
Hit the switch up the suicide doors (damn)
We already know you vanished though (ooh)
Hit my momma when I ride in that, oh
All these motherfuckers so false with me (yah)
If your money funny, don't talk to me (nah)
I know there ain't shit that you could offer me (no)
Take a second if you think about crossing me

[Pre-Chorus]
It lasts forever, you should try a sample (goddamn)
Baby, I'm the boss like I'm Tony Danza (Tony Danza)
Everybody trying to tell me what I stand for (what I stand for)
But you don't fucking know me, homie, you don't want war (you don't want war)

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
Let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I guess I'm a disappointment, doin' everything I can
I don't wanna make you disappointed, it's annoying
I just wanna make you feel like everything I ever do was never tryna make an issue for you
But I guess the more you thought about everything you were never even wrong in the first place, right?
Yeah, I'ma just ignore you
Walking towards you with my head down, lookin' at the ground, I'm embarrassed for you
Paranoia, what did I do wrong this time?
That's parents for you
Very loyal?
Shoulda had my back, but you put a knife in it—my hands are full
What else should I carry for you?
I cared for you, but...

[Chorus]
Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you don't wanna make this work, you just wanna make this worse
Want me to listen to you, but you don't ever hear my words, you don't wanna know my hurt yet
Let me guess, you want an apology, probably
How can we keep going at a rate like this?
We can't, so I guess I'ma have to leave
Please, don't come after me, I just wanna be alone right now, I don't really wanna think at all
Go ahead, just drink it off, both know you're gonna call tomorrow like nothing's wrong
Ain't that what you always do?
I feel like every time I talk to you, you're in an awful mood
What else can I offer you?
There's nothing left right now, I gave it all to you

[Chorus]
Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down

[Verse 3]
Yeah, don't talk down to me, that's not gonna work now
Packed all my clothes and I moved out, I don't even wanna go to your house
Every time I sit on that couch, I feel like you lecture me, eventually
I bet that we could have made this work and probably woulda figured things out
But I guess I'm a letdown, but it's cool, I checked out, oh, you wanna be friends now?
Okay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now, sit around and talk about the good times that didn't even happen
I mean, why are you laughing?
Must have missed that joke, let me see if I can find a reaction—no, but at least you're happy

[Chorus]
Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
Oh, I let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
And I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Oh, let you down

[Outro]
I'm sorry
I'm so sorry now
I'm sorry that I let you down



[Music Video Intro: Juicy J]
Ride with the gang, ride with them things
Put a nigga thoughts outside of his brain
Got a bomb on the gas, Garrison Lane
For these kinda bags, you gon' need a crane
I remember comin' up from Memphis in the trenches
Northside, hoppin' fences to ride Benzes

[Chorus]
Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah
Check in with me and do your job
Ferg is the name, Ben Baller did the chain
Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane

[Verse 1]
Yamborghini chain, rest in peace to my superior
Hermès link could feed a village in Liberia
TMZ taking pictures, causin' mad hysteria
Momma see me on BET and started tearin' up
I'mma start killin' niggas, how you get that trife?
I attended Harlem picnics where you risked your life
Uncle used to skim work, sellin' nicks at night
I was only 8 years old, watching Nick at Nite
Uncle Psycho was in that bathroom buggin'!
Knife to his guts, hope Daddy don't cut him
Suicidal thoughts brought to me with no advisory
He was pitchin' dummy, sellin' fiends mad ivory
Grandma had the arthritis in her hands, bad!
She was poppin' pills like rappers in society
I fuck yo bitch for the irony
I'll send Meechy at yo hoe if yo bitch keep eyein' me

[Chorus]
Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah
Check in with me and do your job
Ferg is the name, Ben Baller did the chain
Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane
Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah
Check in with me and do your job
Ferg is the name, Ben Baller did the chain
Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane

[Post-Chorus]
Suck a nigga dick or somethin'
Suck a nigga dick or somethin'
Suck a nigga dick or somethin'
Suck a nigga dick or somethin'

[Verse 2]
I'ma explain why you probably never seen me
I'm in a sunken place, no Instagram, I'm watchin' TV
I think I trade my breakfast, lunch and dinner for some kitty
Please believe me, I see RiRi, I'ma eat it like panini
I go dumb up in the broad, hit the walls like graffiti
Indian burns all up on a nigga wee-wee
I think I need a foursome, Bella, Kendall, Gigi
It'd be easy if Reneezy hook it all up on the leezy
I go crazy in my Yeezy, Kirk Kneezy on the beat
I told 'em now we finna glow up in the street
Rappers talk subliminal but they don't talk to me
Put 'em in a Jersey shore like Pauly D

[Chorus]
Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah
Check in with me and do your job
Ferg is the name, Ben Baller did the chain
Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane
Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah
Check in with me and do your job
Ferg is the name, Ben Baller did the chain
Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane

[Post-Chorus]
Suck a nigga dick or somethin'
Suck a nigga dick or somethin'
Suck a nigga dick or somethin'
Suck a nigga dick or somethin'



[Video Intro]
Wicked or weakness?
You gotta see this
Waaaaay (yeah, yeah!)

[Album Intro]
Nobody pray for me
It's been that day for me
Waaaaay (yeah, yeah!)

[Verse 1]
Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I'm countin' this
Parmesan where my accountant lives; in fact, I'm downin' this
D'USSÉ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy yo' ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know

[Chorus]
Bitch, be humble (hol' up, bitch)
Sit down (hol' up, lil', hol' up, lil' bitch)
Be humble (hol' up, bitch)
Sit down (hol' up, sit down, lil', sit down, lil' bitch)
Be humble (hol' up, hol' up)

Sit down (hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)

[Verse 2]
Who dat nigga thinkin' that he frontin' on Man-Man? (Man-Man)
Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)
Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
I make a play fucking up your whole life
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still will take you down right on your mama's couch in Polo socks
Ayy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy
I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy
I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy
I stay modest 'bout it, ayy, she elaborate it, ayy
This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ayy
Watch my soul speak, you let the meds talk, ayy
If I kill a nigga, it won't be the alcohol, ayy
I'm the realest nigga after all

[Chorus]
Bitch, be humble (hol' up, bitch)
Sit down (hol' up, lil', hol' up, lil' bitch)
Be humble (hol' up, bitch)
Sit down (hol' up, sit down, lil', sit down, lil' bitch)
Be humble (hol' up, hol' up)
Bitch, sit down (hol' up, hol' up, lil' bitch)

Sit down (hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)



[Verse 1]
You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

[Chorus]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Verse 2]
I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done

[Pre-Chorus]
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

[Chorus]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Post-Chorus]
I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck about you

[Bridge]
No, I don't give a damn
You keep reminiscin' on when you were my man
But I'm over you
Now you're all in the past
You talk all that sweet talk, but I ain't comin' back
Cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
(I'll tell you why)

[Chorus]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
(Too late now)
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
(Boy, I don't give a fuck)

[Post-Chorus]
I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me (get to me)
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Intro: Lil Skies]
CashMoneyAP
Aye, aye, aye

[Chorus: Lil Skies & Landon Cube]
Nowadays I'm too cool for a girlfriend
Nowadays I don't know when the world spins
Live your life like we die when the world ends
So it's alright every time we fuckin' break a sin
Nowadays shit's not the same
Life switched lanes, now these hoes act strange
And I lost my grip on the world in bliss
It's so, it's so

[Verse 1: Lil Skies]
Ayy, it's so lonely on the east side
I don't give a fuck, I keep it real I'm not gon' let it slide
Now she see me up, she let me fuck
Want me to cum inside
Broski going dumb, hopped in the car, he said he down to ride
You a little pup, stop playing tough, ain't make no sacrifice
Yeah, smokin' cookie for my appetite
I don't trust nobody, people talking and be telling lies
We just wanna win and shock them all and catch 'em by surprise
I was saucin' down until we up and then we all rise, yeah
But niggas don't stick to the G-code, balling on my haters
I think that I'm stuck in beast mode
Make it through the foul run to the line and make the free throw
I think that I'm D. Rose
Do 'em like I'm Deebo

[Pre-Hook: Lil Skies]
Aye, but I like to fade away
I got these diamonds on me, and these bitches all in my face
And you wanna be a star, and you wanna win the race
But you cannot rock with me 'cause I was caught on the chase

[Chorus: Lil Skies & Landon Cube]
Nowadays I'm too cool for a girlfriend
Nowadays I don't know when the world spins
Live your life like we die when the world ends
So it's alright every time we fuckin' break a sin
Nowadays shit's not the same
Life switched lanes, now these hoes act strange
And I lost my grip on the world in bliss
It's so, it's so

[Verse 2: Landon Cube]
I think it's so damn strange what these people be saying
I can never even listen to a word that they say
I'm on the west side, that's the best side
By the cliff smoking blicks, that's the best high
And I got a shawty with the best eyes
Talking shit girl, why you putting up a fight?
I'm in my own world, far from the satellites
They want my information, they get no conversation
'Cause nowadays everybody calling
I need a manager 'cause I can't really fuck with nobody (I can't really fuck with nobody, so)

[Pre-Hook: Lil Skies]
Aye, but I like to fade away
I got these diamonds on me, and these bitches all in my face
And you wanna be a star, and you wanna win the race
But you cannot rock with me 'cause I was caught on the chase

[Chorus: Lil Skies]
Nowadays I'm too cool for a girlfriend
Nowadays I don't know when the world spins
Live your life like we die when the world ends
So it's alright every time we fuckin' break a sin

Coming with that bullshit, I just put it to the side
Balling since a baby, they could see it in my eyes

[Chorus: Post Malone & Quavo]
My momma called, seen you on TV, son

Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Verse 1]
I'm from the east side of America
Where we choose pride over character
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is
I live on the west side of America
Where they spin lies into fairy dust
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is

[Refrain]
And don't believe the narcissism
When everyone projects and expects you to listen to 'em
Make no mistake, I live in a prison
That I built myself, it is my religion
And they say that I am the sick boy
Easy to say, when you don't take the risk, boy
Welcome to the narcissism
Where we're united under our indifference

[Verse 2]
And I'm from the east side of America
Where we desensitize by hysteria
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is
I live on the west side of America
Where they spin lies into fairy dust
And we can pick sides, this is us, this is us, this is

[Chorus]
I am the, I am the, I am the sick boy
I am the, I am the, I am the sick boy
They say that I am the sick boy
And they call me the sick boy

[Refrain]
Don't believe the narcissism
When everyone projects and expects you to listen to 'em
Make no mistake, I live in a prison
That I built myself, it is my religion
And they say that I am the sick boy
Easy to say, when you don't take the risk, boy
Welcome to the narcissism
Where we're united under our indifference

[Bridge]
Feed yourself with my life's work
How many likes is my life worth?
Feed yourself with my life's work
How many likes is my life worth?
Feed yourself with my life's work
How many likes is my life worth?
Feed yourself on my life's work
How many likes is my life worth?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm from the east side of America
I am the, I am the, I am the sick boy
I live on the west side of America
I am the, I am the, I am the sick boy
I'm from the east side of America
They say that I am the sick boy
I live on the west side of America
Yeah, they call me the sick boy

[Chorus]
I am the, I am the, I am the sick boy
I am the, I am the, I am the sick boy
They say that I am the sick boy
Yeah, they call me the sick boy



[Verse 1]
So you're still thinking of me
Just like I know you should
I can not give you everything, you know I wish I could
I'm so high at the moment
I'm so caught up in this
Yeah, we're just young, dumb and broke
But we still got love to give

[Chorus]
While we're young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada
Young dumb broke high school kids

[Verse 2]
We have so much in common
We argue all the time
You always say I'm wrong
I'm pretty sure I'm right
What's fun about commitment?
When we have our life to live
Yeah, we're just young dumb and broke
But we still got love to give

[Chorus]
While we're young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada
Young dumb broke high school kids

[Bridge]
Jump and we think - do it all in the name of love
Love
Run into sin, do it all in the name of fun
Fun
Whoa-oa-oa
I'm so high at the moment
I'm so caught up in this
Yeah, we're just young, dumb and broke
But we still got love to give

[Chorus]
While we're young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb

Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids

[Intro: Kodak Black]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Take that all the way up
I'm about to take off on these niggas
And I'm codeine dreaming
(And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming
And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming)

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinkie
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinkie
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
I'm in Uranus right now, I think I've seen a demon
I thought I left you back there in the cell or am I dreamin'?
Say I ain't dealing with your dawg, going a different way
I broke up with my redbone, I went the milky way
I'm ridin' in a Wraith feeling like I'm in outer space
Stars on my sunroof, Planet of the Apes
I couldn't wait until they released me, right back on the turf
I took off on you bustas, left you right on planet Earth
I feel like Jimmy Neutron, how I blast off on a verse
I know my son gon' like this song so I ain't finna curse
Know he gon' wanna explore the world so I'm gon' show him first
Say we're just distinguished  beings, baby, me and you diverse

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinkie
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinkie
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
(And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming
And I'm codeine dreaming)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Bout to take off on you peons and go back to Mars
Bout to leave these peons behind like the Jackson 4
Tried to moonwalk on the moon and had to wax the floors
Tried to put me in a box and then I crashed the Porsche
Bout to wake up in your biatch and go back & forth
Got her trapping out the the Fiat, she be back and forth
'Bout to put myself together, take it back apart
Got the codeine on my breath it smell like caviar
Codeine dreaming, they come true too, that's my spaceship, brp brp!
My milky way got pregnant, she said it's for you hoo
FaceTime Kodak with my new new, I left you 'cause he knew you
I'm wet dreaming 'bout Actavis, 2 new cups feel like new boobs
Tunechi!

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinkie
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinkie
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling

[Verse 3: Kodak Black]
Bout to go to Saturn, heard they got the baddest species
You can hit me on my Galaxy, you tryna reach me
I went to Mars to get some Xanax bars and to go to sleep
I'm in my Orange space shuttle flyin' two seats
I left Future in Pluto cause that boy was too geeked
End up playing Sudoku all the way in Mercury
I took too much of shrooms feel like I'm on Neptune
I'm with an alien, she show me what that neck do
And I'm a metamorphosis, you just a regular dude
You need a space suit to get up on this latitude
If she ain't foreign, then she boring, I need a Zircon
You takin' morphine, homie you a moron

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinkie
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinkie
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
(And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming
And I'm codeine dreaming)



[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said "Bye Suzanne"
After the first night, but tonight I am

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
A one-night stand turned a two-night stand
It was "come sunlight, scram," now we hug tight, and...
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck!

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
My name's (ooh), my name's (ooh)
River (ooh), river run
Call me (ooh), call me (ooh)
River (ooh), we'll let the river run

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Always the bridesmaid, never "The bride, hey!"
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one (I'm sorry)
I don't want to admit to something (I fucked up)
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run



[Verse 1]
I found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Verse 2]
Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

[Chorus 2]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Instrumental]

[Chorus 3]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight

[Intro: Justin Timberlake]
Mhmm, yeah, alright
Ooh

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
Everyone knows all about my direction
And in my heart somewhere I wanna go there
Still, I don't go there

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Everybody says, "say something
Say something, say something
Say something, say something
Say something"
I don't wanna get caught, up in the rhythm of it
But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Maybe I'm looking something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking something I can't have

[Verse 2: Chris Stapleton & Justin Timberlake]
Everyone knows all about my transgressions
Still in my heart somewhere, there's melody and harmony
For you and me, tonight (whoa)
I hear them call my name

[Chorus: Chris Stapleton & Justin Timberlake]
Everybody says, "say something
Say something, say something
Say something, say something
Say something"
I don't want to get caught up in the rhythm of it
But I can't get help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Maybe I'm looking something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking something I can't have)

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something is to say nothing

[Part-Chorus: Justin Timberlake, Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
But I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Maybe I'm looking something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have)

[Outro: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing



[Intro]
(Why I go easy?)
(Know why I go easy)
Wait

[Verse 1]
King of my city, king of my country, king of my homeland
King of the filthy, king of the fallen, we livin' again
King of the shooters, looters, boosters, and ghettos poppin'
King of the past, present, future, my ancestors watchin'
King of the culture, king of the soldiers, king of the bloodshed
King of the wisdom, king of the ocean, king of the respect
King of the optimistics and dreamers that go and get it
King of the winners, district, and geniuses with conviction
King of the fighters, king of the fathers, king of the belated
King of the answer, king of the problem, king of the forsaken
King of the empathy, you resent me, king of remorse
King of my enemies, may they father feed, I rejoice
King of the skyscrapers, dodgin' haters, broke religion
Nine faces, go against 'em, I erased 'em with precision
I embrace them with collision
Kings did it, king's vision, Black Panther, King Kendrick
All hail the king

[Verse 2]
I dropped a million tears
I know several responsibilities put me here
I don't pedal backwards, but I live old-fashioned
The lens that I'm lookin' through
Won't prescribe me the right glasses, masses are now free
Ashes I'm dumpin' out, 'bout to spread all 'cross seas
Sisters and brothers in unison, not because of me
Because we don't glue with the opposition, we glue with peace
But still'ed fuck up your organization if any beef
What do you stand for?
Are you a activist? What are your city plans for?
Are you a accident? Are you just in the way?
Your native tongue contradictin' what your body language say
Are you a king or you jokin'? Are you a king or you posin'?
Are you a king or you smokin' bud rocks to keep you open?
Because the king don't cry, king don't die
King don't lie, king give heart, king get by, king don't fall
Kingdom come, when I come, you know why
King, king, king, king
I am T'Challa



[Verse 1]
I don't really say this that often
But there's somethin' that the papers forgot
Every time I read them, I know I feed them
But I know, they're painting, but they can't leave a mark
'Cause my friends don't read the papers
And they don't really care if we're awesome or not
So every time I read them, I know I feed them
But I know, they wanna see me hang on the wall

[Chorus]
You don't know me
Don't you think that I get lonely?
It gets dark inside my head
Check my pulse, and if I'm dead, you owe me
If you're lonely
Don't you think you're on your own?
When it gets dark inside your head
Check my pulse, and if I'm dead, you owe me

[Verse 2]
Say it to my face if you mean it
Say it to my face, but you won't
I know I'm not losin'
But I'm losin' my mind
Does anybody know what that's like?

[Chorus]
You don't know me
Don't you think that I get lonely?
It gets dark inside my head
Check my pulse, and if I'm dead, you owe me
If you're lonely
Don't you think you're on your own?
When it gets dark inside your head
Check my pulse, and if I'm dead, you owe me

[Bridge]
If I'm dead, you owe me
If I'm dead, you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
If I'm dead, you owe me

[Drop]
If I'm dead, you owe me
(If I'm dead, if I'm dead, If I'm dead, you owe me)

[Outro]
You don't know me
Don't you think that I get lonely?
It gets dark inside my head
Check my pulse and if I'm dead, you owe me
If you're lonely
Don't you think you're on your own?
When it gets dark inside your head
Check my pulse, and if I'm dead, you owe me



[Intro]
1, 2...

[Chorus]
Moon river, wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style someday (someday, day)
A dream maker (maker, maker)
My heartbreaker (you heartbreaker)
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' that way (the same, the same...)

[Refrain]
Two drifters off to see the world
There's such a crazy world to see
We're all chasin' after all the same
Chasin' after our rainbow's end

[Chorus]
Moon river, wider than a mile
Crossin' in style someday
My dream maker, heartbreaker
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' the same

[Refrain]
Two drifters off to see the world
It's such a crazy world you'll see
What I see, who I become
What I see, who I become
We're all chasin' after our end
Chasin' after our ends

[Outro]
Life's just around the bend, my friend
Moon river and me

[Intro]
One, one, one, one, one...

[Verse 1]
Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

[Pre-Chorus]
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

[Chorus]
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

[Verse 2]
I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, no way)
(Nowhere to turn, no)
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

[Pre-Chorus]
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

[Chorus]
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

[Bridge]
Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna learn it by heart (I got new rules, I count 'em)
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I... (I got new...)

[Pre-Chorus]
One: Don't pick up the phone (yeah)
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone (alone)
Two: Don't let him in (uh-ooh)
You'll have to kick him out again (again)
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

[Chorus]
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
(Whoa-ooh, whoa-ooh, whoa)
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
(Baby, you know I count 'em)
I gotta tell them to myself

[Outro]
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
You're gettin' over him



[Intro]
KSR
It's Cardi, ayy
Said, "I'm the shit, they can't fuck with me if they wanted to"

[Chorus]
Said, "Lil bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to"
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

[Verse 1]
Now she say she gon' do what to who? Let's find out and see
Cardi B, you know where I'm at, you know where I be
You in the club just to party, I'm there, I get paid a fee
I be in and out them banks so much, I know they're tired of me
Honestly, don't give a fuck 'bout who ain't fond of me
Dropped two mixtapes in six months, what bitch working as hard as me?
I don't bother with these hoes, don't let these hoes bother me
They see pictures, they say, "Goals," bitch, I'm who they tryna be
Look, I might just chill in some BAPE, I might just chill with your boo
I might just feel on your babe, my pussy feel like a lake
He wanna swim with his face, I'm like, "Okay"
I'll let him get what he want, he buy me Yves Saint Laurent
And the new whip, when I go fast as a horse, I got the trunk in the front
I'm the hottest in the street, know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth, hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
And I pay my mama bills, I ain't got no time to chill
Think these hoes be mad at me, their baby father run a bill

[Chorus]
Said, "Lil bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to"
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

[Verse 2]
If you a pussy, you get popped, you a goofy, you a opp
Don't you come around my way, you can't hang around my block
And I just checked my accounts, turns out, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I put my hand above my hip, I bet you dip, he dip, she dip
I say I get the money and go, this shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter as gold, tell that lil bitch play her role
I just arrove in a Rolls, I just came up in a Wraith
I need to fill up the tank, no, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know that none of their niggas is safe
I go to dinner and steak, only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's, now it's a crib with a gate
Rollie got charms, look like Frosted Flakes
Had to let these bitches know, just in case these hoes forgot
I just run and check the mail, another check from Mona Scott

[Chorus]
Said, "Lil bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to"
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

[Chorus]
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through (place to come through)
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you

[Verse 1]
At times I wonder why I fool with you
But this is new to me, this is new to you
Initially, I didn't wanna fall for you
Gather my attention it was all for you, so don't
Take advantage, don't leave my heart damaged
To understand that things go a little bit better when you plan it... oh

[Chorus]
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through (place to come through)
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna fall in love off of subtweets, so
Let's get personal
I got a lot of cool spots that we can go
Tell me what's the move and I got you
I'm only acting like this 'cause I like you
Just give me the vibe to slide then
Oh, I might make you mine by the night, and

[Chorus]
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through (place to come through)
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you

[Outro]
Ride, ride, ride, come and vibe with me tonight
I don't need nothing else but you
(I don't need nothing else but you)
Ride, ride, ride, come and vibe with me tonight
I don't need nothing else but you
Nothing else but you
Do, do, do, do, do, do
Oh, oh, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, mmm, mmm, mmm
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
I don't need nothing else but you



[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
(Who can relate? Woo!)
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Logic]
I don't wanna be alive
I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die today
I just wanna die
I don't wanna be alive
I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die
And let me tell you why

[Verse 1: Logic]
All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it
I know I'm hurting deep down but can't show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?
They say every life precious but nobody care about mine

[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
(Who can relate? Woo!)
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Logic]
I want you to be alive
I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die today
You don't gotta die
I want you to be alive
I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die
Now lemme tell you why

[Verse 2: Alessia Cara]
It's the very first breath
When your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air
When you're there
Chest to chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long
And seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection
Finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

[Verse 3: Logic]
I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
(Who can relate? Woo!)
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Logic]
I finally wanna be alive
I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die today
I don't wanna die
I finally wanna be alive
I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die

[Outro: Khalid]
Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow
But I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry anymore
I wanna feel alive
I don't even wanna die anymore
Oh I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't even wanna die anymore

Throw a stack on the Bible
Never Snapchat or took molly
She fall through plenty, her and all her ginnies
Yeah, we at the top floor, right there off Doheny
Oh no, I can't fuck with y'all

I wanna green light, I wanna be like, I wanna press my
Mama, dear, spare your feelings
I'm reliving moments, peeling more residual
(I can) buy the building, burn the building, take your bitch, rebuild the building just to fuck some more
(I can) justify my love for you and touch the sky for God to stop, debating war
Put the pussy on a pedestal
Put the pussy on a high horse
That pussy to die for
That pussy to die for
Peter, piper, picked a pepper
So I could pick your brain and put your heart together
We depart the shady parts and party hard, the diamonds yours
The coupe forever
My best shots might shoot forever like (brr)

[Hook: Travis Scott]
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah
You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine

I get those goosebumps every time, I need the Heimlich

[Intro]
Menoh

[Hook: Lil Skies]
And I got all the drugs in the world that you need
We get high to pass time but bitch I ain't no fiend
I got money on my mind, I be stacking my green
Shawty said she like my style, I be dripping with ease
Please don't send me naked pictures, I don't like to be teased
Say she got that super soaker, well girl just let me see
I ain't worried bout shit, these niggas ain't scaring me
I was destined for this life, this is my destiny
Friends wanna be friends when you doing the most
How you tell me you my bro then you went out and told
Niggas say they down to ride but be folding like clothes
Purple hearts all on my garment, I ain't trusting a soul

[Verse 1: Lil Skies]
I roll up the Mary Jane, no they can't feel my pain
I'm still trapping everyday, I think I'm stuck in my ways
If you looking for a handout get the fuck out my face
I don't care about no friends because they all were just fake
In my inbox like I owe you, I got this by myself
I was broken down bad when you said you would help
Now I'm up, they love to hate me, that's just bad for your health
And she say she a college girl but left her books on the shelf
She gon' fuck me like a porn star, a rock star
Trying to skirt off in that fast car, like NASCAR
Girl you know I got a cold heart
If I would give it to you, would you tear that shit apart
Red roses on my grave, bury me with art
And with some Backwoods and a lighter just so I could spark
Midnight rider, never put the car in park
I'm shining bright just like a light cause I came from the dark
I ain't never had nobody, put that on my mommy
I might have to catch a body if you try to stop me
She ride like a Kawasaki and she like it sloppy
Oh you got a hotty body, come ride on my Johnny
Imma go show you the wave, just give me some space
Why you all up in my face like you need a taste
Good designer on my waist, shooters keep the K
I tell them boys to play it safe, don't lay in your grave
I ain't never taking time off, I'm steady grinding
I'm never lying, was never crying
Take flights I'm flying, no you can't see me
Say you need me but you deceive me

[Hook: Lil Skies]
And I got all the drugs in the world that you need
We get high to pass time but bitch I ain't no fiend
I got money on my mind, I be stacking my green
Shawty said she like my style, I be dripping with ease
Please don't send me naked pictures, I don't like to be teased
Say she got that super soaker, well girl just let me see
I ain't worried bout shit, these niggas ain't scaring me
I was destined for this life, this is my destiny
Friends wanna be friends when you doing the most
How you tell me you my bro then you went out and told
Niggas say they down to ride but be folding like clothes
Purple hearts all on my garment, I ain't trusting a soul

[Verse 2: Landon Cube]
I ain’t never forgotten, not a soul worth remembering
Cause all these motherfuckers turn to foe when they envy
So I don't talk, I work hard
Cause you could be someone today and just be nobody tomorrow
She said I'll never be shit but a god damn rock star
That blunt ash on the floor
Well she ain't that far off
Said she ain't that far off
Roll, smoke
That's all we know
Toke
Took a drag out that wood now she goin for my wood
So we going to my hood
Yea she gonna get it good
And she know who we are
She want this rock star life and she said I'm going far
And she off a bar
And she can't feel her face no more
Yeah she off a bar and she can't feel her face no more
She said she can't feel her face no more



[Verse 1: Phillip Carlyle]
You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
I know you want me
So don't keep saying our hands are tied
You claim it's not in the cards
And fate is pulling you miles away
And out of reach from me
But you're here in my heart
So who can stop me if I decide
That you're my destiny?

[Chorus 1: Phillip Carlyle]
What if we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine
Nothing could keep us apart
You'd be the one I was meant to find
It's up to you, and it's up to me
No one can say what we get to be
So why don't we rewrite the stars?
Maybe the world could be ours
Tonight

[Verse 2: Anne Wheeler]
You think it's easy
You think I don't want to run to you
But there are mountains
And there are doors that we can't walk through
I know you're wondering why
Because we're able to be
Just you and me
Within these walls
But when we go outside
You're gonna wake up and see that it was hopeless after all

[Chorus 2: Anne Wheeler]
No one can rewrite the stars
How can you say you'll be mine?
Everything keeps us apart
And I'm not the one you were meant to find
It's not up to you, it's not up to me
When everyone tells us what we can be
How can we rewrite the stars?
Say that the world can be ours
Tonight

[Post Chorus: Both, Anne Wheeler, Phillip Carlyle]
All I want is to fly with you
All I want is to fall with you
So just give me all of you
It feels impossible
It's not impossible
Is it impossible?
Say that it's possible

[Chorus 3: Phillip Carlyle and Anne Wheeler]
How do we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine?
Nothing can keep us apart
Cause you are the one I was meant to find
It's up to you, and it's up to me
No one can say what we get to be
And why don't we rewrite the stars?
Changing the world to be ours

[Outro: Anne Wheeler]
You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
But I can't have you
We're bound to break and
My hands are tied



[Verse 1]
You must think that I'm stupid
You must think that I'm a fool
You must think that I'm new to this
But I have seen this all before

[Refrain]
I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

[Pre-Chorus]
But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true

[Chorus]
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
No way that you'll see me cry
(No way that you'll see me cry)
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)

[Verse 2]
I know you're thinkin' I'm heartless
I know you're thinkin' I'm cold
I'm just protectin' my innocence
I'm just protectin' my soul

[Refrain]
I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

[Pre-Chorus]
But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true

[Chorus]
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
No way that you'll see me cry
(No way that you'll see me cry)
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)

[Bridge]
No
No, no, no, no, no
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
No, no, no, no
No, no, no
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
(No way that you'll see me cry)
Ahhh
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)

[Outro]
'Cause every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true
I'm way too good at goodbyes



[Intro: Shiloh Dynasty]
I know you so well, so well
I mean, I can do better than he can
I've been pretty—

[Bridge: XXXTENTACION]
I know you're somewhere, somewhere
I've been trapped in my mind, girl, just holding on
I don't wanna pretend we're something, we're nothing
I've been stuck thinking 'bout her, I can't hold on

[Verse: XXXTENTACION]
I'm in pain, wanna put 10 shots in my brain
I've been trippin' 'bout some things, can't change
Suicidal, same time I'm tame
Picture this, in bed, get a phone call
Girl that you fucked with killed herself
That was this summer and nobody helped
And ever since then, man, I hate myself
Wanna fuckin' end it, pessimistic
All wanna see me with no pot to piss in
But niggas been excited 'bout the grave I'm diggin'
Havin' conversations 'bout my haste decisions
Fuckin' sickenin'; at the same time
Memories surface through the grapevine
'Bout my uncle playin' with a slip knot
Post-traumatic stress got me fucked up
Been fucked up since the couple months they had a nigga locked up

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb
I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb

[Outro: Shiloh Dynasty]
I know you so well (I know you, girl)
I mean, I can do better than he can
I've been pretty—
I know you so well



[Verse 1]
It was the 14th of October
Had that t-shirt off your shoulder
I was drunk, said I was sober
And you said yeah right
We were talkin’ for a minute
Then some guy tried to cut in
You took my hand and we pretended
Like I was your guy

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, then I tried to guess your middle name
For 30 minutes bet we played that game

[Chorus 1]
That mango-rita you were drinkin’
And that Coldplay song that you were singin’
And I bet right now you’re probably thinkin’
That it’s crazy I remember every detail, but I do
From your blue jeans to your shoes
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable

[Verse 2]
We were dancin’, we were buzzin’
Takin’ shots like it was nothin’
Did the runnin’ man, you loved it
Yeah, you laughed out loud
You brushed away your blonde hair
And you kissed me out of nowhere
I can still show you the spot
Where everything went down

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I told you I was gonna marry you
You probably didn’t think that it was true

[Chorus 2]
That mango-rita you were drinkin’
And that Coldplay song that you were singin’
And I bet right now you’re probably thinkin’
That it’s crazy I remember every detail, but I do
I can still smell your perfume
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable

[Bridge]
Oh, that night was just like you, baby
I can taste the mango-rita you were drinkin’
And it feels just like it was last weekend
That we jumped in
Right off the deep end

[Chorus 2]
That mango-rita you were drinkin’
And that Coldplay song that you were singin’
And I bet right now you’re probably thinkin’
That it’s crazy I remember every detail, but I do
I can still smell your perfume
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable

[Outro]
From your blue jeans to your shoes
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable



[Verse 1]
Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my old life behind
Not a yes sir, not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

[Chorus]
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, thunder
Thunder

[Verse 2]
Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say you're basic, they say you're easy
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage
While you were clapping in the nose bleeds

[Chorus]
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder

[Bridge]
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder, thunder

[Chorus]
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder, thunder



[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'd rather be a lover than a fighter (fighter)
'Cause all my life, I've been fighting
Never felt a feeling of comfort
All this time, I've been hiding
And I never had someone to call my own, oh nah
I'm so used to sharing
Love only left me alone
But I'm at one with the silence

[Chorus]
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been silent for too long

[Drop]
I've been quiet for too long
I've been quiet for too long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long

[Verse 2]
I'm in need of a savior, but I'm not asking for favors
My whole life, I've felt like a burden
I think too much, and I hate it
I'm so used to being in the wrong, I'm tired of caring
Loving never gave me a home, so I'll sit here in the silence

[Chorus]
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been silent for too long

[Drop]
I've been quiet for too long
I've been quiet for too long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long

Drop the top, pop it, let it bang (ay)

Can't find her, someone to—
(My eyes are all cried out)
Lost it, riots
(Gunfire inside my head)
I've lost it, riots
(Gunfire inside my head)

[Pre-Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Baby I need you in my life, in my life
Please bae, don't go switchin' sides, switchin' sides
I swear this is where you reside, you reside
Please bae, don't go switchin' sides, switchin' sides

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & Trippie Redd]
Ooooh
Please don't throw your love away, huh
Please don't throw your love away, huh
Please don't throw your love away, huh, yeah



[Pre-Chorus]
That's true, that's right
She's sipping Moet, and yeah I swear it gets her wetter
My Louboutins new, so my bottoms, they is redder
No I'm not a rat but I'm all about my cheddar
Just talked to your homie she said we should be together
Gave me brain, was so insane that I made her my header
If she ever call my phone you know I gotta dead her
But I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her
Hello I was listening to this song
It goes like

[Chorus]
I know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it
You'll find another life to live
I swear that you'll get over it
I know you're sad and tired
You've got nothing left to give
You'll find another life to live
I know that you'll get over it

[Verse 1]
Wish I never ever ever told you things
I was only only trying to show you things
Iced out heart on your neck trying to froze your ring
I had to get a me a new bitch to hold the pain
We was in Hawaii looking at the rain
She smiling happy but I'm laughing 'cause her new man a lame
(broke boi, broke boi, broke boi, broke boi)
That just goes to show me money don't attract a thing (real shit)
Stuck to the plan even though you used to go with my mans
Oh get over it

[Chorus]
I know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it
You'll find another life to live
I swear that you'll get over it
I know you're sad and tired
You've got nothing left to give
You'll find another life to live
I know that you'll get over it

[Verse 2]
I tied up my RAF you strapped up your Rick
Diamonds on your neck, ice all on my wrist
Complement my style
She don't want me I'm running wild
You know I respect her on that level
She don't want me then I'ma let her
Go over there with that broke fella
Walk off my Saint Laurent, that leather
My new chick I swear that she better
Want me back, never (ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
That's true, that's right
She's sipping Moet, and yeah I swear it gets her wetter
My Louboutins new, so my bottoms, they is redder
No I'm not a rat but I'm all about my cheddar
Just talked to your homie she said we should be together
Gave me brain, was so insane that I made her my header
If she ever call my phone you know I gotta dead her
But I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her

[Chorus: Oh Wonder & Lil Uzi Vert]
I know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it (woah)
You'll find another life to live
I swear that you'll get over it (you'll get over it)
I know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it (no,no)
You'll find another life to live (you will)
I know that you'll get over it (oh)

[Outro: Oh Wonder & Lil Uzi Vert]
You'll get over it
You'll get over it
You'll get over it
You'll get over it
That's true, that's right
She's sipping Moet, and yeah I swear it gets her wetter
My Louboutins new, so my bottoms, they is redder
No I'm not a rat but I'm all about my cheddar
Just talked to your homie she said we should be together
Gave me brain, was so insane that I made her my header
If she ever call my phone you know I gotta dead her
But I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her



[Intro]

Ayy, ayy, gang, gang
Ayy, ayy, ayy, gang, gang
Ayy, ayy, ayy, gang, gang
Ayy, ayy, ayy, gang, gang

[Verse 1]
They say Lil Nahmir where you been at? I'm just passin' a breeze

I been coolin', layin' low, but I'm not takin' a seat
But just know a nigga back and this time I won't leave
I been runnin', runnin', runnin', gotta check me a bag
I got hunnids on my neck and I got Trues on my ass
Niggas said I'm goin' broke, well I just take it and laugh
I be speedin' in that foreign with Five-O on my ass
But I'm that nigga, I won't ever change, rubbin' off the paint
Smokin' dank, got a Uzi in my lap, I let it bang
Free Lil Tay, know he keep a 'K, but he not Tay-K
I up the chop and let it blow him, watch this bitch heat his face, I'm that nigga
And all my young niggas pullin' triggers, we gorillas
We let this bitch off until you feel us, for you niggas
That's always on IG with them yiggies, takin' pictures
Is you really gon' use 'em or you just loafin' for them bitches?
You niggas really hoes and you be acting like these bitches
You niggas say y'all silent but y'all probably in there snitchin'
Most the niggas that's around me throwin C's like they crippin'
But they do it for the twins, free Lil Corey and Lil Christian
But I'm rockin' with my shooters and that's mandatory
One up top like I'm Mozzy, bitch I keep a 40
You say I'm lackin', nigga try me, shoot you and yo' shorty
I'm cookin up in the lab like I'm Rick and Morty
40 poppa, hit a mobsta, turn your brain to pasta
Hit a opp up, dreads swangin' just like I'm a Rasta
Smokin' ganja and I'm zooted, walkin' in my Pradas
Any nigga test my gangsta nigga, I'ma pop 'em
And we ain't throwin' hands with you fuck niggas
It's one up top up in that chamber, better duck nigga
Niggas dissin' on Lil Valley, he get slumped nigga
We shoot his body then we lay him in that trunk nigga
I'm one-hundo, bitch that's on my life, I will never fold
A nigga speakin on Lil Quay, well then that nigga gotta go
I'm really small but I can fight but I'ma still up that pole
For you niggas think I'm pussy, you gon' have to show me hoe
Police always at my fuckin' crib, I don't tell 'em shit
I'm really rapping 'bout this fuckin life, that I fuckin' live
But I be coolin', tryna focus on them fuckin' dividends
But if it's money near yo' head, well I'ma fuckin get it, man

[Verse 1]
Running from the morning
Think I hit a wall
Late nights, not you
Running from the moment
So I don’t recall
Late nights, not you
Waking up in a cold sweat
Someone else in this cold bed
I’d do anything to not be alone
All alone with the ceiling
All alone with this feeling
And I wonder if I’ll ever let go

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried spending my nights under
Someone new
But the truth is
I could spend my whole life getting over you

[Chorus]
Yeah yeah yeah
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you

[Verse 2]
Drowning in my coffee
To wash the alcohol
Out my bloodstream
Sitting here I wonder
If we hadn’t been at all
Who would I be
Waking up in a cold sweat
Someone else in this cold bed
And I wonder if I’ll ever let go

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried spending
My nights under
Someone new
But the truth is
I could spend my whole life getting over you

[Chorus]
Yeah yeah yeah
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried spending
My nights under
Someone new
But the truth is
I could spend my whole life getting over you

[Chorus]
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you



[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I got, I got, I got, I got—
Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle though, ambition, flow inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got—
Realness, I just kill shit 'cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil, that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, that's him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a—
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction, burners, boosters
Burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids and
I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier's DNA
Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn't have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I'm supposed to, antisocial, extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gonna plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar & Geraldo Rivera]
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a be-, fuck your life
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the makin' of marriages

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me somethin'
You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you're in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy and walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder — these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder — our DNA

[Video Outro]
DNA, DNA
Real nigga in my DNA
Ain't no ho inside my DNA
Drippin' gold inside my DNA
Power shows inside my DNA
DNA
Real nigga in my DNA
Ain't no ho inside my DNA



[Verse 1: Lettie Lutz]
I am not a stranger to the dark
"Hide away," they say
"'Cause we don't want your broken parts"
I've learned to be ashamed of all my scars
"Run away," they say
"No one'll love you as you are"

[Pre-Chorus: Lettie Lutz]

I know that there's a place for us
For we are glorious

Another round of bullets hits my skin
Well, fire away 'cause today, I won't let the shame sink in
We are bursting through the barricades
And reaching for the sun

Yeah, that's what we've become
(Yeah, that's what we've become)

[Pre-Chorus: Lettie Lutz and Ensemble]
Won't let them break me down to dust

And I know that I deserve your love

There's nothing I'm not worthy of
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Lettie Lutz]
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
This is brave, this is bruised
This is who I'm meant to be, this is me

[Chorus: Lettie Lutz, Ensemble, Both]
Look out 'cause here I come
(Look out 'cause here I come)
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum
(Marching on, marching, marching on)
I'm not scared to be seen

[Verse 1]
Got a boy back home in Michigan
And he tastes like Jack when I'm kissing him
So I told him that I never really liked his friends
Now he's gone and he's calling me a bitch again
There's a guy that lives in the garden state
And he told me that we'd make it 'til we graduate
So I told him that the music would be worth the wait
But he wants me in the kitchen with a dinner plate

[Pre-Chorus]
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that we're meant to be
But jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best of me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the same mistakes, yeah
Always make the same mistakes 'cause

[Chorus]
I'm bad at love (ooh-ooh)
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one (ooh-ooh)
That could finally fix me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love

[Verse 2]
Got a girl with California eyes
And I thought that she could really be the one this time
But I never got the chance to make her mine
Because she fell in love with little thin white lines
London girl with an attitude
We never told no one, but we look so cute
Both got way better things to do
But I always think about it when I'm riding through

[Pre-Chorus]
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that I'm in too deep
And jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best in me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the same mistakes, yeah
Always make the same mistakes 'cause

[Chorus]
I'm bad at love (ooh-ooh)
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one (ooh-ooh)
That could finally fix me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, you know, you know, you know
I'm bad at love (ooh-ooh)
I'm bad at love (ooh-ooh)
I'm bad at love (ooh-ooh)

[Bridge]
I know that you're afraid I'm gonna walk away
Each time the feeling fades
Each time the feeling fades
I know that you're afraid I'm gonna walk away
Each time the feeling fades

[Chorus]
You know I'm bad at love (ooh-ooh)
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one (ooh-ooh)
That could finally fix me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love (ooh-ooh)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, you know, you know, you know

Oh, can you hear my heart say
Ooohhhh, ooh
No, you ain't nobody 'til you got somebody
You ain't nobody 'til you got somebody

[Verse 2]
And I hope I never see the day
That you move on and be happy without me
Without me
What's my hand without your heart to hold?
I don't know what I'm living for
If I'm living without you

[Pre-Chorus]
All my friends, they know and it's true
I don't know who I am without you
I've got it bad, baby

[Verse 1]
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

[Verse 2]
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I

[Verse 1]
I know you're out in Cabo
Hanging with your brother
Wishin' that I was your bottle
So I could be close to your lips again
I know you didn't call your parents and tell 'em that we ended
'Cause you know that they'd be offended
Did you not want to tell 'em it's the end?

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know we're not supposed to talk
But I'm getting ahead of myself
I get scared when we're not
'Cause I'm scared you're with somebody else
So, I guess that it's gone
And I just keep lying to myself
Oh, I can't believe it, I...

[Chorus]
I miss you, yeah, I miss you
I miss you, yeah, I miss you, oh, I do
I miss you, yeah, I miss you
Though I’m tryin’ not to right now

[Verse 2]
You weren't a fan of pictures
So I hardly ever took 'em
Got them saved in my mind from the bedroom
So that way I can't forget your skin
So I saved all the texts
All of the best over the years
Just to remind myself of how good it is, or was

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know we're not supposed to talk
But I'm getting ahead of myself
I get scared when we're not
'Cause I'm scared you're with somebody else
So, I guess that it's gone
And I just keep lying to myself
Oh, I can't believe it, I...

[Chorus]
I miss you, yeah, I miss you
I miss you, yeah, I miss you, oh, I do
I miss you, yeah, I miss you
Though I’m tryin’ not to right now

[Bridge]
So I saved all the texts
All of the best over the years
Just to remind myself of how good it is
Yeah, I saved all the texts off of my ex
Minus the tears
Just to remind myself of how good it is, or was
'Cause I...

[Chorus]
I miss you, yeah, I miss you
I miss you, yeah, I miss you, oh, I do
I miss you, yeah, I miss you
Though I’m tryin’ not to right now
I can't help it, I just...
Though I’m tryin’ not to right now
I can't help it, I just...

Letra de "Dura"[Intro]
(Me gusta mi reggae)
Tiritiritiririti-Daddy
(Evo Jedis)

[Pre-Coro]
Cuando yo la vi
Dije, "Si esa mujer fuera para mí"
Perdóname, te lo tenía que decir

[Coro]
'Tás dura, dura
Dura, dura, dura
Que estás dura, mano arriba porque tú te ves bien
'Tás dura, mamacita, te fuiste de nivel
Dura, mira como brilla tu piel
'Tás dura, dímelo, dímelo, ¿cómo es que e'?
'Tás dura, yo te doy un veinte de diez
'Tás dura, dura, dura

[Verso 1]
Tú eres la máquina, la máquina de baile
Si no tiene' a nadie vente pa' mi' brazos, caile
Ese perfume se siente en el aire
Algo como Argentina, tú me traes los Buenos Aires
'Tá poderosa, media escandalosa
Habrán muchas mujeres pero tú eres otra cosa
Si fuera un delito eso de que estás hermosa
Te arresto en mi cama y te pongo las esposas
Tienes el toque, toque, toque
Miren el material, edición especial
Tienes el toque, toque, toque
Perdóname, te lo tenía que decir

[Coro]
'Tás dura, dura
Dura, dura, dura
Que estás dura, mano arriba porque tú te ves bien
'Tás dura, mamacita, te fuiste de nivel
Dura, mira como brilla tu piel
'Tás dura, dímelo, dímelo, ¿cómo es que e'?
'Tás dura, yo te doy un veinte de diez
'Tás dura, dura, dura

[Puente]
Me gusta como mueve ese ram-pam-pam
Mi mente maquineando en un plan-plan-plan
Si me deja, en esa curva le doy pam-pam
Cuál es tu receta no sé, 'tá pa' comerte bien
Me gusta como mueve ese ram-pam-pam
Mi mente maquineando en un plan-plan-plan
Si me deja, en esa curva le doy pam-pam
Tu belleza retumba, las otras pa' la tumba

[Verso 2]
Uno, dos y tres, vamo' a darle
La envidia que se calle
Saludos a to'as las nenas que paralizan la calle
¿Cómo tú te llamas? ¿de dónde tú eres?
Dame el número pa' entrar contigo en detalles
Y tienes el toque, toque, toque
Pareces una estrella formando el alboroto
Tienes el toque, toque, toque
Se cae el internet cuando subes una foto

[Pre-Coro]
Cuando yo la vi (dímelo, baby girl)
Dije: "Si esa mujer fuera para mí" (pa' mí esa baby)
Perdóname, te lo tenía que decir

[Coro]
'Tás dura, dura
Dura, dura, dura

[Verse 1]
Lighting stog after stog, I choke on the smoke
They tell me to quit, don't listen what I'm told
Help me forget that this world is so cold
I don't even know what I'm chasin' no more
Tell me what I want, just keep searchin' on
It's never enough, cup after cup
Blunt after blunt
I wouldn't give one if I could find a fuck, ha, ha, ha, uh
In the cut and I put that on my momma
And my bitch called talkin' 'bout some drama
I swear there ain't no time for women on the come up
It's either the pussy or the commas

[Chorus]
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

[Verse 2]
Uh, yeah, push the gas, get a motherfuckin' nose bleed
She ain't never met a youngin' do it like me
She got a man but she says she really like me
She doin' things to excite me
She sendin' all her friends snaps of my new tracks
'Cause all these hoes know whats about to come next
I hit my plug up, got the paper connect
I drop a couple bands I just wanna go...

[Chorus]
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

[Bridge]
Knowing all of this, it just don't make a difference
I'm just talking shit to the ones that'll listen
I come with the heat man, I swear I'm never missing
And I'm still the same and I swear I'm never switching
Knowing all of this, it just don't make a difference
I'm just talking shit to the ones that'll listen
I come with the heat man, I swear I'm never missing
And I'm still the same and I swear I'm never switching

[Chorus]
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
Cold with the flex



[Verse 1]
First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh
Second things second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look to me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

[Chorus]
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

[Verse 2]
Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I was choking in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down
And rained down, like...

[Chorus]
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

[Bridge]
Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flame
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down
And rained down, like...

[Chorus]
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

[Verse 1]
Can't keep my hands to myself
Think I'll dust 'em off, put 'em back up on the shelf
In case my little baby girl is in need
Am I coming out of left field?

[Chorus 1]
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I been feeling it since 1966, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

[Verse 2]
Got another mouth to feed
Leave it with a baby sitter, mama, call the grave digger
Gone with the fallen leaves
Am I coming out of left field?

[Chorus 2]
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I been feeling it since 1966, now
Might've had your fill, but you feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

[Verse 3]
We could fight a war for peace
(Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now)
Give in to that easy living
Goodbye to my hopes and dreams
Start flipping for my enemies
We could wait until the walls come down
(Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now)
It's time to give a little to the kids in the middle
But, oh until it falls
Won't bother me

[Bridge]
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming back?

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, yeah
Your love is an abyss for my heart to eclipse, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

[Chorus 3]
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I've been feeling it since 1966, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Might've had your fill, but I feel it still

Acting like we wasn't more than a summer fling

[Chorus: SZA]

Searchin' for you like love
Only thing keepin' me from droppin' you right now
Right now (love)
Only thing keepin' me by your side
Only thing keepin' me by your side now

[Skit]
But see, Solána, if you don't say something, speak up for yourself
They think you stupid, you know what I'm saying?



[Verse]
Diplomatic immunity, fuck 'em
All that peace and that unity
All that weak shit'll ruin me, fuck 'em, yeah
'Cause niggas started talkin' to me like I'm slowin' down
Opinions over statistics, of course
Gassed off journalistic
Come at me and all you'll get is the ballistic report
Booked a private room at Wally's, waiter twistin' the cork
I got multi-colored rings like the Olympics, of course
At award shows, cuttin' through the tension, of course
Girls huggin' me then askin' me, "What scent that is, boy?"
I be walkin' around the Six like I invented it, boy
Yeah, who am I? The do or die
The one with the fewest lies and the truest ties
They try to compare us, but
Like a job straight outta high school there's no you and I
I taught you everything you know, now you got student pride
All factual, I call the house "the embassy"
The studio "the chapel", I hate to travel
I just pulled up on Solána show, the girl's a natural
I knew her way back when Hollywood was international
Yeah, the furthest I've been, that's word to my ends
Word to the flags that belong in the hood of my Benz
Very presidential, I broke all the codes for zonin' in my residential
I broke spirits that I never meant to
My body isn't much of a sacred temple, with vodka and wine
And sleep at the opposite times
Promise shit is gettin' outta line like when you make a stencil
Or gettin' outta line like when you break a pencil
Violatin' the Treaty of Versailles
Champagne is the alias, but no cease and desist in I
I refuse to comply with regulations
I listen to heavy metal for meditation, no silence
Like Sanders on the Detroit Lions
Get a run around and I'll bury you where they won't find ya
Motor City Casino, I'm at the cage with my old license
They tell me "don't worry, I got your money" like Osirus
(I'm the Osiris of this shit)
Dirty 30, workin' on me
Tired of women that may tag me in pictures airin' my dirty laundry
Catering is from Giorgio Baldi, Robyn's favorite
Shit is nice, but I prefer Madeo
Calamari rings and tomato
I got the sauce and now shorties keep claimin' preggo
Wakin' up at 6 PM like, "Where does the day go?"
Forecastin' tornadoes, brainstormin' retaliation at dinner tables
2010 was when I lost my halo
2017 I lost a J. Lo
A Rotterdam trip had me on front page though
I had to lay low, Hot Topic like your everyday clothes
Closed off but I could never stay closed
Billboard awards, I claimed 13 out in Vegas like Sureños
Black excellence, but I guess when it comes to me it's not the same though, all goodie
That just pushed me to do the things we all couldn't
Niggas stakin' out the crib, it's all gravy
Protection that God gave me
Shit is complex like short niggas 'round tall ladies
I gotta watch who I'm talkin' to like it's all-ages
I've seen buddin' careers turn to sit around and talk about other careers, judgin' their peers
Knowledge from niggas who did not contribute to none of this here
Cover my ears, my security government tier
Yeah, advance the venue so we know the exits
Check the guest list
If opps make an appearance at least it's expected
Tell 'em I don't wanna link like a broken necklace
I'll be in better company with my own reflection
Mirror, mirror, on the ceiling of my suite in the Royal Palace
The TV playin' Al Jazeera
Inshallah, I hope the mission keeps on gettin' clearer
Whenever, wherever, OVO will always be together like Shakira

[Outro]
I love, I love
I love, I love it
Baby, I



[Chorus: Quavo]

If Set say he set then I set it (Set)
If Take say he set then I set it (Take)
Shoot for my niggas like Belly (shoot)
Shoot for my niggas like Belly (baow)

[Chorus: Quavo]
Ice tray, young nigga flooded (ice ice ice, yeah)
If a nigga hatin', call him Joe Budden (pussy)
Coupe outside and it's press button (skrt skrt)

Ice tray the gang (ice), ice tray the gang, fuck it
Ice tray the gang (woo), ice tray the gang (ice)
Ice tray the gang (yeah), ice tray the gang, fuck it

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Uhh, ayy, diamonds look like candy corn
Sent a chain to Melbourne, no mail, it's airborne
Diamond on this chain with the flash like it's shootin' porn
Five karat ring, them lil' pointers tell me where you're goin'
Chopper sing like Anita Baker, ooh
Hand around the neck when I fuck, Undertaker
If my diamonds had a voice it would sound like Fantasia
Two million dollars on my jewelry, big appraisal
Um, nigga ball like DeRozan, huh
AP skelly fully frozen, huh
Right wrist cause commotion
Big rocks on my wrist, so white need a whole pint of lotion
Diamonds be wet like the ocean
Want a watch like this pussy, it's gon' cost you 'bout a pretty token
Big karats and they pokin'

[Chorus: Quavo & Lil Yachty]
Ice tray, young nigga flooded (ice ice ice, yeah)
If a nigga hatin', call him Joe Budden (pussy, fuckin' pussy)
Coupe outside and it's press button (skrt skrt)
Got that nigga mad 'cause your bitch fuckin' (hah), fuck it
Ice tray the gang (fuck it), ice tray the gang (woo)
Ice tray the gang (ice), ice tray the gang, fuck it
Ice tray the gang (woo), ice tray the gang (ice)
Ice tray the gang (yeah), ice tray the gang, fuck it



[Verse 1]
She wants to get married, she wants it perfect
She wants her granddaddy preaching the service
And she wants magnolias out in the country
Not too many people, save her daddy some money

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Ooh, she got it all planned out
Yeah, I can see it all right now

[Chorus 1]
I'll wear my black suit, black tie, hide out in the back
I'll do a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
I'll try to make it through without crying so nobody sees
Yeah, she wanna get married
But she don't wanna marry me

[Verse 2]
I remember the night when I almost kissed her
Yeah, I kinda freaked out, we've been friends forever
And I'd always wonder if she felt the same way
When I got the invite, I knew it was too late

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I know her daddy's been dreading this day
Oh, but he don't know he ain't the only one giving her away

[Chorus 1]
I'll wear my black suit, black tie, hide out in the back
I'll do a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
I'll try to make it through without crying so nobody sees
Yeah, she wanna get married
But she don't wanna marry me

[Bridge]
Bet she got on her dress now, welcoming the guests now
I could try to find her, get it off of my chest now
But I ain't gonna mess it up, so I wish her the best now

[Chorus 2]
So I'm in my black suit, black tie, hiding out in the back
Doing a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
I'll try to make it through without crying so nobody sees
Yeah, she wanna get married
Yeah, she gonna get married
But she ain't gonna marry me
Whoa, but she ain't gonna marry me, no



[Verse 1]
Cold 'cause she has been here before
She doesn’t cry anymore, no looking back
No, she doesn't go to the bar
Too many lovers she's scarred, and they want her back

[Chorus]
She loves control, she wants it her way
And there's no way she'll ever stay unless you give it up (give it up)
She loves control, she wants it her way
And all it takes is just one taste, you wanna give it up (give it up)

[Verse 2]
Bold, you know she lives for the thrill
You know she lusts for the kill, so they won't come back
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Don't, don't you try taming the storm
Don't say you haven't been warned (oh)
'Cause she won't like that, like that

[Chorus]
'Cause she loves control, she wants it her way
And there's no way she'll ever stay unless you give it up
She loves control, she wants it her way
And all it takes is just one taste, you wanna give it up (give it up, give it up for love)

[Post-Chorus]
She loves control (control, hey)
She loves control (control, hey)

[Bridge]
Say what you want
But the way she kills you makes you feel alive
And you know that it feels right

[Chorus]
She loves control, she wants it her way
And there's no way she'll ever stay unless you give it up
She loves control, she wants it her way
And all it takes is just one taste, you wanna give it up

[Post-Chorus]
She loves control (control, hey!)
She loves, she loves
She loves, she loves
Oh, you know that she loves it; she can't live without it, no
She loves control (control, hey)
Control, hey

Passionate from miles away

Leavin'
You're just doing that to get even
Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now
They keep fallin' apart

[Chorus]
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no

[Outro: Zoë Kravitz]
Um, trying to think of the right thing to say

I made love to a stripper (stripper), first I had to tip her (phrrr)
Twenty thousand ones (woo), she said I'm that nigga (I am)
I said, "I'm that nigga, bitch, I already know it" (I know it)
I come with bad weather (ksh), they say I'm a storm (ayy)
VVS's in my charm, that's a Roc-A-Fella chain
I was sendin' bricks to Harlem back when Jay was still with Dame
I'm in Phillipe Chow (what?), I got a Patek on (okay)
Got a stripper with me, she picked up the check, homes (phrrr)
She gon' fuck it up, fuck it up (fuck it up)

[Verse 1]
I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

[Pre-Chorus]
Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

[Chorus 1]
I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

[Verse 2]
I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

[Chorus 2]
I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

[Bridge]
I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

[Chorus 3]
I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise till death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

[Outro]
Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go



[Verse 1]
Like a rainy Sunday morning makes me want to stay in bed
Twisted up all day long
You're my inspiration, girl
You take me places, put the words right into these songs

[Bridge]
Stealing kisses under cover, babe
See forever when I see your face
And I swear God made you for me

[Chorus]
You make it easy loving up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my saving grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy

[Verse 2]
You took all my rough around the edges
Never let it ruffle up your feathers, angel
Yeah I'm down for life, you got me wrapped around your finger
And I like it just in case you can't tell

[Chorus]
You make it easy loving up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my saving grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy

[Bridge]
Stealing kisses under cover, babe
See forever when I see your face
And I swear God made you for me

[Chorus]
You make it easy loving up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my saving grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy
You make it easy



[Intro: Future]
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon shoot you

[Hook: Big Sean]
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Don’t owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me 'cause I'm homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me ‘lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like a edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I’m never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out 'cause I’m enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time, mane
(Thank you God, God bless you, thank you so much)

[Hook: Big Sean]
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Look, I woke up in beast mode
With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though
(Never sold my soul, never will never have)
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory, I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything except worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I’m on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I’m Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga, I don’t act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga, I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot “count to ten” me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen court rooms and court sides, ain’t too many seen both sides
Nigga, fuck what you know
Nigga, I’m takin' back control
The underdog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off, so

[Hook: Big Sean]
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Outro: Kanye West & Big Sean]
Bounce back, bounce, bounce
Bounce back, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bitch, bounce (Yeah)
Is you a real one?
Is you a real one?
Real one
Real one
Is you a real one?
Real one
Real one

[Verse 1]
Got a girl from the south side, got braids in her hair
First time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell off my chair
Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats

[Chorus]
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

[Verse 2]
The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt
But I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help
Got hips like honey, so thick and so sweet
It ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets

[Chorus]
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

[Bridge]
We're out here in the boondocks
With the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass
With my lips on hers
On the highway to heaven
Headed south of her smile
Get there when we get there
Every inch is a mile

[Chorus]
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

[Outro]
I'ma take it slow
As fast as I can
Body like a back road
Drivin' with my eyes closed

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Future]
I wanna be your endgame
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team (whoa, whoa, whoa)
I wanna be your endgame, endgame

[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Future]
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies (yeah)
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah (git, git)
And I heard about you, ooh (yeah)
You like the bad ones, too

[Verse 1: Future]
You so dope, don't overdose
I'm so stoked, I need a toast
We do the most, I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin' a boat
I got a reputation, girl that don't precede me (yeah)
I'm one call away whenever you need me (yeah)
I'm in a G5 (yeah), come to the A-Side (yeah)
I got a bad boy persona, that's what they like (what they like)
You love it, I love it, too 'cause you my type (you my type)
You hold me down, and I protect you with my life

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Future]
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love, you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say (I know what they all say)
But I ain't tryna play

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I wanna be your endgame (endgame)
I wanna be your first string (first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your endgame, endgame

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
Knew her when I was young
Reconnected when we were little bit older, both sprung
I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me, in rumors, I'm knee-deep
The truth is, it's easier to ignore it, believe me
Even when we'd argue, we'd not do it for long
And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits, and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities
I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July
I've passed days without fun, this endgame is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say, yeah
But I ain't tryna play

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I wanna be your endgame (endgame)
I wanna be your first string (wanna be your first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your endgame, endgame

[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Future]
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies
Hey, big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah
And I heard about you, ooh
You like the bad ones, too

[Verse 3: Taylor Swift]
I hit you like bang, we tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em
Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy
I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
And I can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul
It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold
You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
So here's the truth from my red lips

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Future, & Ed Sheeran]
I wanna be your endgame (endgame)
I wanna be your first string (me and you, first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (be your A-Team now, A-Team)
I wanna be your endgame, endgame
I wanna be your endgame (oh, I do)
I wanna be your first string (first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your endgame, endgame

Two cups, toast up with the gang
From food stamps to a whole 'nother domain
Out the bottom, I'm the livin' proof (Super)
Ain't compromising, half a million on the coupe
Drug houses, lookin' like Peru
Graduated, I was overdue
Pink molly, I can barely move
Ask about me, I'm gon' bust a move
Rick James, thirty-three chains
Ocean air, cruisin' Biscayne
Top off, that’s a liability
Hit the gas, boostin' my adrenaline

Four-door Maybach, I drive anything
Buy my Range, make 'em go insane
(Oh my Lord, praise him be)
My guillotine, drank promethazine
TEC and beams, go to those extremes
Parliament, calamari Wednesday
Parlay in Vegas, we was in attendance
Before the business, Theodore lenses
Theo-Dur prescriptions, focus on the missions
Intermission, never take a break
Switch states, touch down, foreign plates
Ain't no way, ain't no fuckin' way
We call the play, we didn't come to play
Rob the bank, we gon' rob the game
They gang, we gang
But they are not the same (Freebandz)

[Chorus]
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Rep the set, gotta rep the set

Gas gone, never nod off

Watch out, watch out, watch out, yeah
That's my shot, that's my shot, that's my shot, yeah
Spendin', I'm spendin' all my fuckin' pay



[Hook]
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh

[Verse 1]
She's falling but she doesn't think he'll catch her
'Cause her last relationship was a disaster
Accusations everyday, she didn't know why
All her calls would be ignored, he's on his own time
Should've ended it before it started
All she ever got was broken hearted
He was cheating on her, trying to flip it back on her like a victim
Now she all alone and starting over
Now she got baggage on her shoulder
But the new guy really loves her
She loves him, but she doesn't trust herself anymore

[Hook]
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh

[Verse 2]
Despite her past, she can't help the attraction
He tells her that he's nothing like the last one
He redefines in every way what love is
She fell for him and hasn't gotten up since
Every now and then, she goes off, though
Beating on his chest like a bongo
He understands she's coming from a hurt place
Answers all the questions on her survey
Doesn't get jealous, doesn't break trust
Doesn’t call her, "Hoe" after hang-ups
Give her everything she ever wanted
And even though she still feels haunted

[Hook]
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh

You love it when I fall on my face
Don't act so surprised when
I'm in, oh, rightful places
Ain't it righteous? Amen (amen)

This time around, there's still time to turn it around

To be drunk and in love in New York City
Midnight into morning coffee, burning through the hours talking
Damn

I knew from the first time, I'd stay for a long time, 'cause
I like me better when, I like me better when I'm with you

[Verse 2]
I don't know what it is but I got that feeling
Waking up in this bed next to you swear the room, yeah, it got no ceiling
If we lay, let the day just pass us by
I might get to too much talking, I might have to tell you something
Damn

[Chorus]
I like me better when I'm with you

I knew from the first time, I'd stay for a long time, 'cause

[Intro]
First things first: rest in peace Uncle Phil
For real, you the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant, I'ma be a better you
Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville, fulfilled
Listen, even back when we was broke, my team ill
Martin Luther King woulda been on Dreamville
Talk to a nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Verse 1]
No role models and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed
By the baddest bitch, not Trina but I swear to God
This bitch'll make you call your girl up
And tell her, "Hey, what's good?"
"Sorry I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good."
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, "Nah, I was the same without it."
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
Before I started callin' bitches "bitches" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
You wasn't sweatin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Verse 2]
I want a real love, dark skinned Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga, I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do'
Nigga, you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt 'fore she leave
I'ma need my shirt back (nigga, you know how it go)

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Interlude: George W. Bush]
There's an old saying in Tennessee—I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee—that says, fool me once… shame on… shame on you. Fool me, you can't get fooled again.

[Bridge]
Fool me one time, shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you
Fool me one time, shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you

[Verse 3]
My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script, the bitch probably couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret, could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

Baddest bitch and she Spanish, I fly her to Calabasas
We get nasty, I'm her daddy, she know a nigga ain't average
Ain't nothin' wrong with fake asses, bitch, turn around, let's make magic
I'm geekin', uh-huh, I'm on it, don't look at me like you want it, no
Tell 'em that we ain't stuntin', in fourth down we ain't puntin' it
King of District Columbia, can't come here without a permit
This shit really a jungle, gorillas and anacondas
Hey, hey, Young Jefe holmes

[Chorus: Brent Faiyaz]
She see money all around me
I look like I'm the man, yeah
But I was down and out like last week
Tell me where have you been?
You came out of hiding, girl
Don't act like I'm your man
You just a fan, you don't hold rank
Don't hold no rank



[Intro: Kyle + Lil Yachty]
Man, fuck
What's wrong Kyle?
Man, these kids, man, talkin' shit, makin' me feel bad
Man, fuck them kids, bro! Look around, bro, look at life
Man, you're right
Mmm, you see? You see these fine bitches over here?
Yeah, woah…
You see these trees man? You see this water?
I guess it is okay
Come on, man, you got so much more to appreciate, man
Man you know what, y-you're right…
You damn right I'm right, I can't remember a time I was god-damn wrong
Man, thanks, Lil' Boat
Hey man, that's what I'm here for

[Verse 1: Kyle]
I ain't been gettin' high...
Well maybe a little, baby, I don't wanna lie
I know when you text me, girl, I don't always reply
Well you're not an angel either, you can't even fly
I notice, you think that you know shit
All this shade that's comin' at me, I wonder who throws it
They can't see the vision, boy they must be out of focus
That's a real hot album homie, I wonder who wrote it, oh shit
Otay, pray them niggas go away
Always hella clowns around it look like Cirque Du Soleil
This is not the album either, these are just the throwaways
This shit still so cold when it drop, it's gonna be a mothafuckin' snow day
Ayy, boy is good and he knows it, he don't say it, he shows it
I'm just like DeRozan, if I shoot it, it goes in
I am in Cali just coastin', get 'em so wet they need coasters
I got a selfie with Oprah, I just ain't never post it
And I'm in my happy place posted, I ain't frown since '06
I ain't cried since '01, my pad like Six Flags and your house is no fun
You can come back to mine though, your friend ain't cute but it's fine though
We gon' end on a high note

[Chorus: Kyle]
I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind
Oh, I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind

[Refrain: Kyle]
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I...

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
She said she 21, I might have to I.D. that
All my bitches come in pairs like balls in my nutsack
I remember ridin' around the city in a Hatchback
Lookin' for a problem with my young goblins
I'ma send a model home with her neck throbbin'
I done made so much money that it's non-stoppin'
Got my brothers on my back like the last name
I remember tellin' everyone I couldn't be tamed
Woah, six months later I had snapped and now I'm in the game
Went from fake chains to diamonds in another lane
Went from "Can you take me here?" to screening out the lane
Went from "Damn this nigga lame" to remember my name
So I remember all the people who ain't fucked with me
They went to college, now all them niggas is history
Upgraded from gold to diamonds in my teeth
Riding deep in the van, like we lookin' for a mystery (Raggy!)
So don't fuck with me
No, lately I been livin' like luxury
Boat and Kyle stick together like piano keys
And on my mother's mother I won't fuck a bitch without a damn rubber

[Chorus: Kyle]
I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind
Oh, I...I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind

[Refrain: Kyle]
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I...

Tired of feelin' like I'm trapped in my damn mind
Tired of feelin' like I'm wrapped in a damn lie
Tired of feelin' like my life is a damn game
Nigga really wanna die in the night time

[Verse: XXXTENTACION]
Only time I feel pain, when I'm feelin' love
That's why it's tatted on my face that I'm damn numb
Only time I'm in my mind, when I'm all alone
That's why I'm never really alone in the night time
Change hoes like clothes, I can't get attached
'Cause these hoes fire starters like lit matches
I've been feelin' really lost, duckin' all attachments
I don't really go outside 'cause I hate traffic
I don't wanna go outside, get caught in traffic

Tired of feelin' like I'm trapped in my damn mind
Tired of feelin' like I'm wrapped in a damn lie

Tired of feelin' like I'm trapped in my damn mind
Tired of feelin' like I'm wrapped in a damn lie
Tired of feelin' like my life is a damn game
Nigga really wanna die in the night time
Tired of feelin' like I'm trapped in my damn mind
Tired of feelin' like I'm wrapped in a damn lie
Tired of feelin' like my life is a damn game

Grips on your waist, front way, back way

(Verse 1)
Yeah I know that the woes and the weight of the world
Can get in side our minds and be too much sometimes, I know

From the roller coaster ride beat you up inside, baby don't
But if you ever feel that way, don't you ever hesitate, cause

You got my number you can call on me
If you're in trouble put the fall on me
When you're mad you can take it out on me

Wanna take you out on the town on my dime anytime, tell me when you're free

Straight up to my face, straight up to my face

[Verse 1]
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Look like you hidin' your problems
Really you never was solid
No, you can't "son" me
You won't never get to run me
Just when shit look out of reach

Like one, three, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
That's when they smile in my face
Whole time they wanna take my place

Skrrt
And more chune for your headtop
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?



[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Look, my nigga this is dedication, this is anti-hesitation
This a real nigga celebration, this a Dime Blocc declaration
Fifty-Ninth and Fifth Ave, granny's house with vanilla wafers
This the remedy, the separation, 2Pac of my generation
Blue pill in the fuckin' Matrix, red rose in the gray pavement
Young black nigga trapped and he can't change it
Know he a genius, he just can't claim it
'Cause they left him no platforms to explain it
He frustrated so he get faded
But deep down inside he know you can't fade him
How long should I stay dedicated?
How long 'til opportunity meet preparation?
I need some real nigga reparations
'Fore I run up in your bank just for recreation

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
Dedication, hard work plus patience
The sum of all my sacrifice, I'm done waitin'
I'm done waitin', told you that I wasn't playin'
Now you hear what I been sayin', dedication
It's dedication, look

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I spent my whole life thinkin' out the box
Boxin' homies three-on-one, got DP'ed but I ain't drop
Chirp on me, here I come, brrt, spin around the block
They blurped on me, said I ran a stop sign but that's a lie
I spent my whole life starin' at the stage
Playin' Sega, daddy smokin' sherm, mama playin' spades
Catchin' vapors, grandma said I'd get some Jordans for my grades
That's my baby, when she died my heart broke a hundred ways
I spent my whole life tryna make it, tryna chase it
The cycle of a black man divided, tryna break it
You take a loss, shit don't cry about it, just embrace it
Minor setback for major comeback, that's my favorite
My nigga L said: "You do a song with Nip, K. Dot he a better crip"
I said he a man first, you hear the words out his lips?
About flourishing from the streets to black businesses?
Level four yard livin' given to false imprisonment
Listen close my nigga, it's bigger than deuces and fours my nigga
Since elementary we close my nigga, yeah, straight like that
I give you the game, go back to the turf and give it right back
For generations we been dealt bad hands with bad plans
Prove your dedication by hoppin' out Grand Am's
I'm at the premiere politickin' with Top, Nip, and Snoop
Damn, Pac watchin' the way we grew, from dedication

[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar]
If it ain't congratulate then it look like hate
If it ain't congratulate then it look like what, Nipsey?
Hol' up!

[Verse 3: Nipsey Hussle]
This ain't entertainment, it's for niggas on the slave ship
These songs just the spirituals I swam against them waves wit
Ended up on shore to their amazement
I hope the example I set's not contagious
Lock us behind gates but can't tame us
Used to be stay safe, now it's stay dangerous
'Cause ain't no point in playin' defense nigga
That's why I dove off the deep end nigga, without a life jacket
Couple mil, tour the world, now my life crackin'
Cook the books, bring it back so it's no taxes
Royalties, publishing, plus I own masters
I'll be damned if I slave for some white crackers
I was mappin' this out, I hit the heights backwards
Hoppin' out the eighty-five in Reebok classics
Ran a couple marathons just to get established
To make it happen, you got to have it

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
Dedication, hard work plus patience
The sum of all my sacrifice, I'm done waitin'
I'm done waitin', told you that I wasn't playin'
Now you hear what I been sayin', dedication
It's dedication

I got that bag on me nigga, like I’m Jansportin'
He dropped his mixtape, thought I woulda repost it

[Verse 1: P.T. Barnum]
Ladies and gents, this is the moment you've waited for (woah)
Been searching in the dark, your sweat soaking through the floor (woah)
And buried in your bones there's an ache that you can't ignore
Taking your breath, stealing your mind
And all that was real is left behind

[Pre Chorus 1: P.T. Barnum]
Don't fight it, it's coming for you, running at ya
It's only this moment, don't care what comes after
Your fever dream, can't you see it getting closer
Just surrender 'cause you feel the feeling taking over
It's fire, it's freedom, it's flooding open
It's a preacher in the pulpit and you'll find devotion
There's something breaking at the brick of every wall
It's holding all that you know, so tell me do you wanna go?

[Chorus: Ensemble & P.T. Barnum]
Where it's covered in all the colored lights
Where the runaways are running the night
Impossible comes true, it's taking over you
Oh, this is the greatest show
We light it up, we won't come down
And the sun can't stop us now
Watching it come true, it's taking over you
Oh, this is the greatest show

[Verse 2: P.T. Barnum]
(Woah) colossal we come these renegades in the ring
(Woah) where the lost get found in the crown of the circus king

[Pre Chorus 2: Ensemble & P.T. Barnum]
Don't fight it, it's coming for you, running at ya
It's only this moment, don't care what comes after
It's blinding outside and I think that you know
Just surrender 'cause you're calling and you wanna go

[Chorus: Ensemble & P.T. Barnum]
Where it's covered in all the colored lights
Where the runaways are running the night
Impossible comes true, intoxicating you
Oh, this is the greatest show
We light it up, we won't come down
And the sun can't stop us now
Watching it come true, it's taking over you
Oh, this is the greatest show

[Post-Chorus: P.T. Barnum & Lettie Lutz]
It's everything you ever want
It's everything you ever need
And it's here right in front of you
This is where you wanna be (This is where you wanna be)
It's everything you ever want
It's everything you ever need
And it's here right in front of you
This is where you wanna be
This is where you wanna be

[Chorus: Ensemble, Phillip Carlyle, Lettie Lutz & P.T. Barnum]
Where it's covered in all the colored lights
Where the runaways are running the night
Impossible comes true, it's taking over you
Oh, this is the greatest show
We light it up, we won't come down
And the sun can't stop us now
Watching it come true, it's taking over you
This is the greatest show
Where it's covered in all the colored lights
Where the runaways are running the night
Impossible comes true, it's taking over you
Oh, this is the greatest show
We light it up, we won't come down
And the walls can't stop us now
I'm watching it come true, it's taking over you
Oh, this is the greatest show

[Bridge: Phillip Carlyle & Anne Wheeler]
'Cause everything you want is right in front of you
And you see the impossible is coming true
And the walls can't stop us (now) now, yeah

This is the greatest show (Oh!)
This is the greatest show (Oh!)
This is the greatest show (Oh!)
This is the greatest show (Oh!)
This is the greatest show (Oh!)

Don't make me wait another day
'Cause passion is passion
You know it just as well as me

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, let's stop running from love
Running from love
Let's stop, my baby

Running from us
Let's stop, my baby

[Chorus]
Oh my, my, my

[Verse 1]
Hello, hello
I'm not where I'm supposed to be
I hope that you're missing me
'Cause it makes me feel young
Hello, hello
Last time that I saw your face
Was recess in second grade
And it made me feel young

[Chorus]
Won't you help me sober up?
Growing up, it made me numb
And I want to feel something again
Won't you help me sober up?
All the big kids, they got drunk
And I want to feel something again
Won't you help me feel something again?
How's it go again?

[Verse 2]
"Goodbye, goodbye,"
I said to my bestest buds
We said that we'd keep in touch
And we did our best
All my new friends
We smile at party time
But soon we forget to smile
At anything else

[Chorus]
Won't you help me sober up?
Growing up, it made me numb
And I want to feel something again
Won't you help me sober up?
All the big kids, they got drunk
And I want to feel something again
Won't you help me feel something again?
How's it go again?
How's it go again?

[Bridge: Rivers Cuomo]
My favorite color is you
You're vibrating out my frequency
My favorite color is you
You keep me young and that's how I wanna be
My favorite color is you
You're vibrating out my frequency
My favorite color is you
You keep me young and that's how I wanna be

[Verse 1]
Hello, hello
I'm not where I'm supposed to be
I hope that you're missing me
'Cause it makes me feel young
Hello, hello
Last time that I saw your face
Was recess in second grade
And it made me feel young

[Pre-Chorus]
And I want to feel something again
I just want to feel something again
How's it go again?

[Chorus]
Won't you help me sober up?
Growing up, it made me numb
And I want to feel something again (my favorite color is you)
Won't you help me sober up?
All the big kids, they got drunk
And I want to feel something again (my favorite color is you)
Won't you help me feel something again? (my favorite color is you)
Can I finally feel something again?
How's it go again?



[Verse 1: Andrew Taggart]
Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much
And that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends
It was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

[Pre-Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

[Post-Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

[Verse 2: Halsey]
You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that Blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no call
Now I'm lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Halsey]
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

[Post-Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Halsey]
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Halsey]
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

[Post-Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Halsey]
We ain't ever getting older
(No, we ain't ever getting older)
We ain't ever getting older
(No, we ain't ever getting older)
We ain't ever getting older
(We ain't ever getting older)
We ain't ever getting older
(No, we ain't ever getting older)
(We ain't ever getting older)
(No, we ain't ever getting older)



[Intro: Mr. Talkbox]

[Pre-Chorus: DJ Dahi & Kendrick Lamar]
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired, fire)
All I want tonight is just get high (high, high, high)
Girl, you look so good, it's to die for (die for)
Ooh, that pussy good, it's to die for (on fire)

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar & Rihanna]
It's a secret society
All we ask is trust (all we ask is trust)
All we got is us
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Kung Fu Kenny now
My resume is real enough for two millenniums
A better way to make a wave, stop defendin' them
I meditate and moderate all of my wins again
I'm hangin' on the fence again
I'm always on your mind
I put my lyric and my lifeline on the line
And ain't no limit when I might shine, might grind
You rollin' with it at the right time, right now
(Only for the dollar sign)

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Bad girl RiRi now
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, leave it now
On your pulse like it's EDM
Gas in the bitch like it's premium
Haul ass on a bitch all in the fast lane
Been a bad bitch way before any cash came
I'm established, hundred carats on my name
Run the atlas, I'm a natural, I'm alright

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Rihanna]
I'm a savage, I'm a asshole, I'm a king
Shimmy ya, shimmy ya, shimmy ya rah (yeah)
You can tell your nigga he can meet me outside (yeah)
You can babysit him when I leave him outside
Ain't no other love like the one I know
I done been down so long lost hope
I done came down so hard I slowed
Honestly forever, all a real nigga want

[Pre-Chorus: DJ Dahi & Kendrick Lamar]
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired, fire)
All I want tonight is just to get high up (yeah)
All I want is, all I want is

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar & Rihanna]
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
10-4, no switchin' sides
Feel somethin' wrong
You actin' shifty, you don't ride
With me no more, I need
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it money? Is it fame? Is it weed? Is it drink?
Is it comin' down with the loud pipes and the rain?
Big chillin', only for the power in your name
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it love for the streets when the lights get dark?
Is it unconditional when the 'Rari don't start?
Tell me when your loyalty is comin' from the heart

[Verse 5: Rihanna & Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me who you loyal to
Do it start with your woman or your man? (Mmm)
Do it end with your family and friends? (Mmm)
How you loyal to yourself in advance?
I said, tell me who you loyal to
Is it anybody that you would lie for?
Anybody you would slide for?
Anybody you would die for?
That's what God for

[Pre-Chorus: DJ Dahi]
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired, fire)
All I want tonight is just to get high up
(All I want is, all I want is)

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar & Rihanna]
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
10-4, no switchin' sides
Feel somethin' wrong
You actin' shifty, you don't ride
With me no more, I need
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

[Outro: Rihanna]
It's so hard to be humble
It's so hard to be
Lord knows I'm tryin'
Lord knows I'm dyin', baby



[Verse 1: Kane Brown]
You say what if I hurt you, what if I leave you
What if I find somebody else and I don't need you?
What if this goes south, what if I mess you up?
You say what if I break your heart in two, then what?

[Pre-Chorus: Kane Brown]
Well I hear you girl, I feel you girl, but not so fast
Before you make your mind up, I gotta ask

[Chorus: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close, what if I lean in?
And the stars line up, and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days, baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?

[Verse 2: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
What if the sky falls (sky falls)
Or the sun stops burnin'?
We could worry about them what ifs 'til the world stops turnin'?
Or I could kiss you (you should kiss me)
What if you liked it? (bet I'd like it)
Well we ain't never gonna know unless we try it

[Chorus: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close, what if I lean in?
And the stars line up, and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?
Awe yeah
C'mon

[Bridge: Kane Brown]
You say what if I hurt you, what if I leave you?
What if I find somebody else and I don't need you?
Damn

[Chorus: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close, what if I lean in?
And the stars line up, and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?

[Outro: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
Away (away)
What if?



[Chorus]
Tryna hide from the cameras, I ain't going outside today
Couldn't find Hi-Tec, so I'm drinking on Act today
I'ma pull up in style, we gon do a drive by in the wraith
I'ma take it to trial, pray to Lord I beat the case

[Verse 1]
That money be callin' I don't do no talkin', so get the fuck outta my face
Gotta tech and a chopper, with a hundred thousand dollars up in the wraith
You know I ain't slippin', you know that I'm with it, I'll shoot him right up in his face
Three say that I'm trippin' you know that I'm drippin'
I'm wrapped in saran today
I just bought a brand new watch from God, I ain't put it on yet
I don't care bout no bitch, I ain't giving her shit, spend it all on my homies
I put on my son, from my car to my house, everything, i own it
When it come to that money you know I ain't stun, I be on it
I just got a pet monkey, cashed out on a tiger
But really don't want it, my son don't like him
He say that we beefin, you know I'll fight em'
My clip full of thunder, you know I'll strike 'em
Wanna join NBA, go and catch you a body
Free Kevin Gates, it's a murder for hire
Double G gang on the front of my title
I ran up my Glock and I bought me a rifle

[Chorus]
Tryna hide from the cameras, I ain't going outside today
Couldn't find Hi-Tec, so I'm drinking on Act today
I'ma pull up in style, we gon do a drive by in the wraith
I'ma take it to trial, pray to Lord I beat the case

[Verse 2]
I jump out at your house I ain't shootin' from the corner
Ben bought me a bitch but I really don't want her
I don't do no cappin' I keep it one hunnid
Right now I'm recordin' with ten thousand on me
He say he want smoke but I know he don't want it
Shoot him and his bitch and I up one of his homie
You know how I'm feelin' I don't got to say it
Face every problem all by my lonely

[Chorus]
Tryna hide from the cameras, I ain't going outside today
Couldn't find Hi-Tec, so I'm drinking on Act today
I'ma pull up in style, we gon do a drive by in the wraith
I'ma take it to trial, pray to Lord I beat the case

[Verse 1]
I jumped up out the Wraith, Kodak bought a Wraith

[Verse 2]
I told you niggas I'm gon' be that fuckin' nigga
Everything be good 'til you doin' better than 'em
They wanna see a nigga shot or see me in the system
All you niggas out here poison like snake venom
Codeine in my liver, rockin' Balenciaga denim
I'm booted even when I'm sober, I don't need a jigga
They sendin' all my niggas on a fuckin' journey
I told that baby to come over 'cause I'm fuckin' horny
My mama told me: "Kill these niggas, son, keep it goin'!"
I'm thug to the bone, but I'm still her baby boy
Lil Kodak, boy they hate to see you in a foreign
They miss when you was in that 'Yota kickin' door

[Verse 1]
Well, you almost had me fooled
Told me that I was nothing without you
Oh, but after everything you've done
I can thank you for how strong I have become

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you brought the flames and you put me through hell
I had to learn how to fight for myself
And we both know all the truth I could tell
I'll just say this is I wish you farewell

[Chorus]
I hope you're somewhere prayin', prayin'
I hope your soul is changin', changin'
I hope you find your peace
Falling on your knees, prayin'

[Verse 2]
I'm proud of who I am
No more monsters, I can breathe again
And you said that I was done
Well, you were wrong and now the best is yet to come
'Cause I can make it on my own
And I don't need you, I found a strength I've never known
I'll bring thunder, I'll bring rain, oh-oh
When I'm finished, they won't even know your name

[Pre-Chorus]
You brought the flames and you put me through hell
I had to learn how to fight for myself
And we both know all the truth I could tell
I'll just say this is I wish you farewell

[Chorus]
I hope you're somewhere prayin', prayin'
I hope your soul is changin', changin'
I hope you find your peace
Falling on your knees, prayin'

[Bridge]
Oh, sometimes I pray for you at night
Someday, maybe you'll see the light
Oh, some say, in life, you're gonna get what you give
But some things only God can forgive

[Chorus]
I hope you're somewhere prayin', prayin'
I hope your soul is changin', changin'
I hope you find your peace
Falling on your knees, prayin'

She the one that bring them rain drops (rain drops)
We go back, remember criss-cross and hopscotch? (hopscotch)
You the one that hold me down when the block's hot (hot)
I make your dreams come true when you wake up (dream)
And your look's just the same without no make-up
Had to pull up on your mama, see what you're made of (mama)
Ain't gotta worry 'bout 'em commas 'cause my cake up
You can run inside my life from that fame bus (skrt)
'Cause I promise, when we step out you'll be famous (yeah)
Modern day Bonnie and Clyde what they named us (why?)
'Cause when we pull up — brt-brt! — all angles

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Uh, she beat her face up with that new Chanel
She like the price, she see the ice, it make her coochie melt
When I met her in the club I asked her who she felt
Then she went and put that booty on that Gucci belt
We don't got no label
She say she want bottles, she ain't got no table
She don't got no bed frame, she don't got no tables
We just watchin' Netflix, she ain't got no cable, okay though
Plug, plug, plug, I'm the plug for her
She want a nigga that pull her hair and hold the door for her
Baby, that's only me, bitch, it okay with me
Baby, okay, okay though

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Lookin' for the one?
Well, bitch, you're lookin' at the one
I'm the best yet, and yet my best is yet to come
'Cause I've been lookin' for somebody
Not just any fuckin' body
Don't make me catch a body
That's for any and everybody
Oh my God, she hit me up all day, get no response
Bitch, you blow my high
That's like turnin' gold to bronze, roll my eyes
And when she on the Molly she a zombie
She think we Clyde and Bonnie
But it's more like Whitney and Bobby
God, forgive me! Tunechi F finessin', I'm a legend
Straight up out the Crescent
Fly your bae down for the Essence
For the record I knew Khaled when that boy was spinnin' records
Mula Gang, winnin' record
I'm just flexin' on my exes, oh God

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber & DJ Khaled]
Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth

CashMoneyAP
Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Verse 1]
Get in my way and try to block me, I'ma show aggression
Slide on your block like Danny Glover with a lethal weapon
I fucked your thot, she gave me top, I guess that's my confession
Got no regrets, I made mistakes, but I learned from my lessons
Trappin' by the stu, villains pull up to the coupe
My car ain't got no roof, thought this shit was bulletproof
I can't feel my face, smokin' on Gorilla Glue
Zoomin' in the coupe, that's the shit I like to do
These is yellow diamonds, shinin' like I'm Pikachu
I'm a boss nigga, get that bag and make the moves
No, I don't like to lose, so I be goin' in, yeah
I'm tryna cop a Benz, yeah, pull up and drop like ten, yeah
You tryna chase the life (what?) well I'm tryna chase the bands, yeah
She wanna fuck with friends, yeah, I got 'em in the trance, yeah

[Chorus]
Ayy, but now they tell me I switched up
Take this Backwood to the face, then grab my cup
Shawty say she comin' through, she on the way to fuck
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love
Ayy, I stack it up, can't get enough
Seen your shawty with you, she look at me and she blush
I'm a jiggy nigga, I don't take her out for lunch
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love
Ayy, bitch, not a lot of love
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love
Ayy, bitch, not a lot of love
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love

[Verse 2]
Not a lot of love
Rollin' in the coupe and she was rollin' off the drugs
Lookin' for the one, girl, you know that I'm the plug
I be booted up with my shooters in the truck
Ayy, and broski keep it and it's tucked
Nigga talkin' 'bout it, but he never runnin' up
Put this shit in motion, so I'm never stayin' stuck
Don't be actin' starstruck every time they show you love

[Chorus]
Ayy, but now they tell me I switched up
Take this Backwood to the face, then grab my cup
Shawty say she comin' through, she on the way to fuck
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love
Ayy, I stack it up, can't get enough
Seen your shawty with you, she look at me and she blush
I'm a jiggy nigga, I don't take her out for lunch
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love
Ayy, bitch, not a lot of love
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love
Ayy, bitch, not a lot of love
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love



[Verse 1]
You say you got a girl
Yeah, how you want me?
How you want me when you got a girl?
The feelin' is reckless
Of knowin' it's selfish
And knowin' I'm desperate
Gettin' all in your love
Fallin' all over love, like
Do it 'til it hurts less
Hangin' out the back, all up in your lap
Like is you comin' home? Is you out with her?
I don't care long as you're here by
10:30, no later than
Drop them drawers, give me what I want

[Chorus]
My man is my man, is your man
Heard it's her man too
My man is my man, is your man
Heard that's her man
Tuesday and Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
I just keep him satisfied through the weekend
You're like 9 to 5, I'm the weekend
Make him lose his mind every weekend
You take Wednesday, Thursday
Then just send him my way
Think I got it covered for the weekend

[Verse 2]
I gotta say I'm in the mood for a little bit more of that
I mean I'm saying what kind of deal, just two days?
I need me at least 'bout four of them, more of them
More you on me, on us
Just tell me you want me, yeah
Monday and I'll be at your door, ready to take her place
Ready to give you, what you've been missin' on weekdays
What you've been waitin' for
10:30, no later than
Drop them drawers, I know what you want

[Chorus]
My man is my man, is your man
Heard it's her man too
My man is my man, is your man
Heard that's her man
Tuesday and Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
I just keep him satisfied through the weekend
You're like 9 to 5, I'm the weekend
Make him lose his mind every weekend
You take Wednesday, Thursday (don't worry 'bout none)
Then just send him my way (don't worry 'bout none)
Think I got it covered for the weekend

[Verse 1]
Strung out falling from the big time
Welcome to the infinite black skies
Brain cleansed fractured identity
Fragments and scattered debris

[Hook]
Thought contagion
Thought contagion

[Verse 2]
Fall down learn when to count it out
Prop me up before I black out
Withdraw before you're out of time
A clean slate and buried war crimes

[Pre-Hook]
You've been bitten by a true believer
You've been bitten by someone who's hungrier than you
You've been bitten by a true believer
You've been bitten by someone's false beliefs

[Hook]
Thought contagion
Thought contagion

[Verse 3]
They'll never do what you want them to
Give it up and watch them break through
It's too late for a revolution
Brace for the final solution

[Hook]
Thought contagion

[Pre-Hook]
You've been bitten by a true believer
You've been bitten by someone who's hungrier than you

Thought contagion

[Outro]
Strung out falling from the big time
Welcome to the infinite black skies
It's too late for a revolution

[Intro]
I'm Lil Tay-K, I don't think you want no action
You want action, you get turned into past tense
Your boys deep? Well, let's get to subtractin'
Smith & Wesson made my 9 with some compassion

[Chorus]
Fuck a beat, I was tryna beat a case
But I ain't beat that case, bitch I did the race (skrt, skrt)
Beat it up, where I nut? Shorty face
Eli blast crackin' 4s like a vase
Pop a nigga then I go out my way (skrrrt)
Do the dash then I go out the way
Rob a nigga shoes, rob a nigga lace
We tryna see a hunnit bands in our face
Fuck a beat, I was tryna beat a case
But I ain't beat that case, bitch I did the race (skrt, skrt)
Beat it up, where I nut? Shorty face
Eli blast crackin' 4s like a vase
Pop a nigga then I go out my way (skrrrt)
Do the dash then I go out the way
Rob a nigga shoes, rob a nigga lace
We tryna see a hunnit bands in our face

[Verse 1]
Pimp gon' be eatin' good noodles every day
Bitch I'm drawin' doodles, Tay-K paint the way
Choppa tear your dudies into fish fillet
I woke up too moody, who gon' die today?
Shoot a fuckboy in his motherfuckin' face
We cookin' up, boy, you don't wanna go dat way
Gotta go dat way, you get robbed for your rackades
Gotta go dat way, boy you not gon' be happy
I tote 50s, I'm a shooter like Young Pappy
Bitch try to rob, we make her dance, Michael Jackson
We was plottin', y'all was tryna get the pack in
Get the pack in, you get robbed for a fraction
I'm Lil Tay-K, I don't think you want no action
You want action, you get turned into past tense
Your boys teeth? Well, let's get to subtractin'
Smith & Wesson made my 9 with sub-compaction

[Chorus]
Fuck a beat, I was tryna beat a case
But I ain't beat that case, bitch I did the race

But I ain't beat that case, bitch I did the race (skrt, skrt)

[Outro]
See it in my mothafuckin' face



[Verse 1: Young P.T.]
I close my eyes and I can see
The world that's waiting up for me
That I call my own
Through the dark, through the door
Through where no one's been before
But it feels like home

[Pre-Chorus: Young P.T.]
They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy
They can say, they can say I've lost my mind
I don't care, I don't care, so call me crazy
We can live in a world that we design

[Chorus: Young P.T.]
'Cause every night I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
A million dreams for the world we're gonna make

[Verse 2: Young P.T.]
There's a house we can build
Every room inside is filled
With things from far away
The special things I compile
Each one there to make you smile
On a rainy day

[Pre-Chorus: Young P.T.]
They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy
They can say, they can say we've lost our minds
I don't care, I don't care if they call us crazy
Runaway to a world that we design

[Chorus: P.T. Barnum]
Every night I lie  in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
A million dreams for the world we're gonna make

[Bridge: Charity Barnum, with P.T. Barnum]
However big, however small
Let me be part of it all
Share your dreams with me
You may be right, you may be wrong
But say that you'll bring me along
To the world you see
To the world I close my eyes to see
I close my eyes to see

[Chorus: P.T. Barnum, Charity Barnum, both]
Every night I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
A million dreams, a million dreams
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
A million dreams for the world we're gonna make

[Outro: P.T. Barnum & Charity Barnum]
For the world we're gonna make



[Verse 1]
Dirty looks from your mother
Never seen you in a dress that color, no
It's a special occasion
Not invited, but I'm glad I made it, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me apologize
I'll make up, make up, make up, make up for all those times
Your love, I don't wanna lose
I'm beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', I'm beggin' you

[Chorus]
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?
Just wait, can you come here please? 'Cause I wanna be with you
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?
Just wait, could you come here please? 'Cause I wanna be with you

[Verse 2]
Can we talk for a moment?
Got these feelings that I'm tired of holdin' on
Wasn't tryna get wasted
I needed more than three or four to say this, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me apologize, yeah
I'll make up, make up, make up, make up for all those times (all those times)
Your love, I don't wanna lose
I'm beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', I'm begging you

[Chorus]
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?
Just wait, can you come here please? 'Cause I wanna be with you
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?
Just wait, could you come here please? 'Cause I wanna be with you

[Bridge]
You say I'm just another bad guy
You say I've done a lot of things I can't undo
Before you tell me for the last time, yeah
I'm beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin' you

[Chorus]
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?
Just wait, can you come here please? 'Cause I wanna be with you
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?
Just wait, could you come here please? 'Cause I wanna be with you

[Verse 1]
I'm jealous, I'm overzealous
When I'm down I get real down
When I'm high I don't come down
But I get angry, baby, believe me
I could love you just like that
And I can leave you just as fast

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But you don't judge me
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too
No, you don't judge me
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too

[Chorus]
'Cause I got issues, but you got 'em too
So give 'em all to me and I'll give mine to you
Bask in the glory, of all our problems
'Cause we got the kind of love it takes to solve 'em
Yeah, I got issues
And one of them is how bad I need you

[Verse 2]
You do shit on purpose
You get mad and you break things
Feel bad, try to fix things
But you're perfect, poorly wired circuit
And got hands like an ocean
Push you out, pull you back in

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause you don't judge me
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too
No, you don't judge me
'Cause you see it from the same point of view

[Chorus]
'Cause I got issues, but you got 'em too
So give 'em all to me and I'll give mine to you
Bask in the glory, of all our problems
'Cause we got the kind of love it takes to solve 'em
Yeah, I got issues
And one of them is how bad I need you

[Bridge]
I got issues, you got 'em too
And one of them is how bad I need you
I got issues, you got 'em too

[Chorus]

So give 'em all to me and I'll give mine to you
Bask in the glory, of all our problems

And one of them is how bad I need you (You got 'em too)
Yeah, I got issues (I got issues)

And one of them is how bad I need you



[Verse 1]
Light a candle
Turn all the lights down low
Baby, let's just lose control, lose control
I can handle every single curve, you know
That I love you, let me show you, oh

[Chorus]
Fall into me, let me breathe the air you breathe
I can take you anywhere you wanna be
When it comes to us every single touch is something special
When we're wrapped up in those sheets
Yeah, we're winning, we're losing
When we're losing sleep

[Verse 2]
Real life, when it's this good don't you know
We don't need to dream at all
Baby, so...

[Chorus]
Fall into me, let me breathe the air you breathe
I can take you anywhere you wanna be
When it comes to us every single touch is something special
When we're wrapped up in those sheets
Yeah, we're winning, we're losing
When we're losing sleep

Fall into me, let me breathe the air you breathe
I can take you anywhere you wanna be, yeah
When it comes to us every single touch is something special
When we're wrapped up in those sheets
Yeah, we're winning, we're losing
When we're losing sleep
When we're losing sleep
Yeah, we're winning, we're losing

[Outro]
Light a candle
Turn all the lights down low



[Verse 1]
Well, I got some Coke in my bourbon
Surfin' the room like Swazye
No, I ain't drunk, I'm amazin'
Yeah, I got that laid way, way back, back in my swagger
X-Factor, feelin' no pain, I'm at the top of my game

[Pre-Chorus]
Darlin', you can't crash my party with your sorry's and what are we's
Don't start rainin' on my Mardi Gras parade for a minute
I ain't even fixin' to listen to your guilt trippin'
You're forgettin', girl, you made your bed and didn't want me in it (Hey!)

[Chorus]
Whoa, girl, simmer on down a notch
Ain't nobody makin' you watch me get my forget you on
No, girl, can't touch my good as gold
I know it's difficult to see me on a roll
But hey, you broke up with me
Yeah, what can I say, babe, you broke up with me

[Verse 2]
Guess you don't know what you want
'Til you see 'em movin' on
Making lonely look like freedom
Baby, don't even act like I'm doing something wrong
If my song comes on and I get lost on that dance floor
In somebody's arms that ain't yours

[Pre-Chorus]
You can't crash my party with your sorry's and what are we's
Don't start raining on my Mardi Gras parade for a minute
I ain't even fixin' to listen to your guilt trippin'
You're forgettin', girl, you made your bed and didn't want me in it (Hey!)

[Chorus]
Whoa, girl, simmer on down a notch
Ain't nobody makin' you watch me get my forget you on
No, girl, can't touch my good as gold
I know it's difficult to see me on a roll
But hey, you broke up with me
Yeah, what can I say, babe, you broke up with me

[Bridge]
For real, babe, ain't tryin' to rub it your face
I'm just breakin' off a little cold hard truth
It is what it is, girl, you did whatcha did, girl
I'm just doin' what a bachelor do

[Pre-Chorus]
Darlin', you can't crash my party with your sorry's and what are we's
Don't be raining on my Mardi Gras parade for a minute
I ain't even fixin' to listen to your guilt trippin'
You're forgettin', girl, you made your bed and didn't want me in it (Hey!)

[Chorus]
Whoa, girl, simmer on down a notch
Ain't nobody makin' you watch me get my forget you on
No, girl, can't touch my good as gold
I know it's difficult to see me on a roll
But hey, you broke up with me
Yeah, what can I say, babe, you broke up with me

You broke up with me
Yeah, what can I say, babe?
You broke up with me



[Jenny Lind]
I'm trying to hold my breath
Let it stay this way
Can't let this moment end
You set off a dream with me
Getting louder now
Can you hear it echoing?
Take my hand
Will you share this with me?
'Cause darling without you

All the shine of a thousand spotlights
All the stars we steal from the nightsky
Will never be enough
Never be enough
Towers of gold are still too little
These hands could hold the world but it'll
Never be enough
Never be enough

For me
Never, never
Never, never
Never, for me
For me
Never enough
Never enough
Never enough
For me
For me
For me

All the shine of a thousand spotlights
All the stars we steal from the nightsky
Will never be enough
Never be enough
Towers of gold are still too little
These hands could hold the world but it'll
Never be enough
Never be enough

For me
Never, never
Never, never
Never, for me
For me
Never enough
Never, never
Never enough
Never, never
Never enough
For me
For me
For me

For me



[Intro: News Cast & (Lil Pump)]
You can see Lil Pump wandering the halls of a school carrying huge bags of pot
Turns out that school was a local Catholic elementary school
A teacher gets slapped with a bag of marijuana in this video
(Yeah, Lil Pump, ooh, yeah, yeah, huh, brr)
And the rapper’s name is Lil Pump

[Bridge]
Yuh, Lil Pump

[Chorus]
I got fast cars, bad bitches and designer clothes
Couple thousand on my wrist and my neck is on froze
Spanish bitches' butt naked and they twerkin' on the stove
Too much racks in my pocket that my wallet can't fold
I got fast cars, bad bitches and designer clothes
I got fast cars, bad bitches and designer clothes
Couple thousand on my wrist and my neck is on froze
Too much racks in my pocket that my wallet can't fold

[Verse]
Drive the 'Rari off the lot, fuck my wrist up with the pot
Bitch, this shit will never stop (brr), presidential on the clock
Couple hoes up on a yacht, I can not fuck with the opps
Bitch, I made it to the top, go to class, I'm on the drop, ayy
Went to the gun store and I bought a rocket (ooh)
One million dollars, cash hangin' out my pocket (damn)
All these diamonds drippin' on me, feelin' like a water faucet
Broke niggas hatin' on me, man, this shit need to stop it
Lil' Pump the freshest nigga comin' out my city
Hit AOD's and I'm blowin' straight fifties (brr)
In the kitchen whippin' Whitney, sippin' lean, I lost my kidney
Ain’t nobody fuckin' with me off the Xan', I squeeze a titty, ayy
Dropped out of school, hopped in a private jet (brr)
Bitch, I'm on the lean, I can't pop no Percocet (no)
I got more money than your father, you can be upset
I'm worth a couple millions, bitch, you know I love to flex

[Chorus]
I got fast cars, bad bitches and designer clothes
Couple thousand on my wrist and my neck is on froze
Spanish bitches' butt naked and they twerkin' on the stove
Too much racks in my pocket that my wallet can't fold
I got fast cars, bad bitches and designer clothes
I got fast cars, bad bitches and designer clothes
Couple thousand on my wrist and my neck is on froze
Too much racks in my pocket that my wallet can't fold



[Verse 1]
I'm tryna put you in the worst mood, ah
P1 cleaner than your church shoes, ah
Milli point two just to hurt you, ah
All red Lamb’ just to tease you, ah
None of these toys on lease too, ah
Made your whole year in a week too, yah
Main bitch out your league too, ah
Side bitch out of your league too, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
House so empty, need a centerpiece
20 racks a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face man I love my baby
You talking money, need a hearing aid
You talking bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain

[Chorus]
Look what you've done
I’m a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy

[Verse 2]
Every day a nigga try to test me, ah
Every day a nigga try to end me, ah
Pull off in that Roadster SV, ah
Pockets overweight, gettin' hefty, ah
Coming for the king, that's a far cry, ah
I come alive in the fall time, I
No competition, I don't really listen
I’m in the blue Mulsanne bumping New Edition

[Pre-Chorus]
House so empty, need a centerpiece
20 racks a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face man I love my baby
You talking money, need a hearing aid

[Verse 3]
Let a nigga brag Pitt
Legend of the fall took the year like a bandit
Bought mama a crib and a brand new wagon
Now she hit the grocery shop looking lavish
Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan
Girls get loose when they hear this song
100 on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars

[Pre-Chorus]
House so empty, need a centerpiece
20 racks a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face man I love my baby
You talking money, need a hearing aid
You talking 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain

[Chorus]
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done

Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy



[Verse 1]
I'm findin' ways to articulate the feeling I'm goin' through
I just can't say I don't love you
'Cause I love you, yeah
It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold
But tonight I'm gon' let you know
Let me tell the truth
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You know what I'm thinkin'
See it in your eyes
You hate that you want me
Hate it when you cry
You're scared to be lonely
'Specially in the night
I'm scared that I'll miss you
Happens every time
I don't want this feelin'
I can't afford love
I try to find a reason to pull us apart
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect
And I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh!

[Chorus]
Even though we're going through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby
I would die for you
Baby I would die for you, yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm finding ways to manipulate the feelin' you're goin' through
But baby girl, I'm not blamin' you
Just don't blame me too, yeah
'Cause I can't take this pain forever
And you won't find no one that's better
'Cause I'm right for you, babe
I think I'm right for you, babe

[Pre-Chorus]
You know what I'm thinkin'
See it in your eyes
You hate that you want me
Hate it when you cry
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect
And I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh!

[Chorus]
Even though we're going through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby
I would die for you
Baby I would die for you, yeah

[Bridge]
I would die for you
I would lie for you
Keep it real with you
I would kill for you, my baby
I'm just sayin', yeah
I would die for you
I would lie for you
Keep it real with you
I would kill for you, my baby
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na

[Chorus]
Even though we're going through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby
I would die for you
Baby I would die for you, yeah babe
(Die for you)



[Intro: Drake]
Murda on the beat so it's not nice
Yeah
It’s a Habibis ting, ya?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, my side girl got a 5S with the screen cracked
Still hit me back right away, better not never hesitate
Don't come around thinkin' you gettin' saved
Tryna show the dogs brighter days
Got a torch, tryna light the way
Bitin' everybody, which is ironic
'Cause your next album probably won't ever see the light of day
Had fans, but you let 'em down
But I guess that's how you niggas gettin' down
I'm so high up I'm like, "How is niggas really gettin' down?"
I could never have a kid, then be out here still kiddin' round
Boys playin' around, where you really wanna take it now?
I got a 150,000 dollars for an afterparty
And I gave it to the killas just to break it down
Bring us up, I never take us down
But if you bring me up, then they might take you down
Fake fucked with me back then
But it's gettin' hard for you to fake it now
Fuck bein' rich when I'm forty, man, I'm tryna make it now

[Hook: Quavo]
Hell nah

Quavo, young nigga, I invented you (ugh)
Ike Turner with the left hand (Ike)
Griselda Blanco with the trap moves
Gangland with the right hand
Undertaker with the tattoos
Never listen to the class rules
Switch it up, they bit the last move (let's go!)
I'm a magnet for bad bitches
You got the goin' out sad bitches
I spent a fifty on the chain (racks)
You spent your last fifty (ugh, cash)
I got the keys to the streets
You got the key to defeat
I got the keys to the warzone (brrrapt!)
You got the key to the peace (ugh)

[Hook: Quavo]

[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
We gon' go live, we gon' go live, yep
We gon' go live, we gon' go live, yep
Gettin' loose off the Henny, 'Roc and a hint of Goose
Ocean deep in my swimmin' pool
Throwin' Dead Prez in my livin' room
Takin' shots, feelin' bulletproof
Flood my Rollie, told my bitch: "Let's go snorkelin'!"
Out in Portland, tryna get in her organs
No, I did not sign with Jay
But I still send a Tidal wave
Yeah, I might just go get the fade
Buy the du-rag and just tie the waves
Yeah, it's lit at the crib, you could stay
Me and Drake kick like Kid N' Play
The way that she servin' that cake
I gotta sit back and digest
I guess, for the fuck-shit I'm biased
I mix, double the cup when I stress
Got my momma out the basement
That's a different type of face lift
Free Max B out the bracelets
Don't hit us askin' what the wave is

[Hook: Quavo]
Hell nah

Nope, no way, nah

[Verse 1]
Don't, don't play with her, don't be dishonest (ayy)
Still not understandin' this logic (ayy)
I'm back and I'm better (and I'm better)
I want you bad as ever
Don't let me just let up
I wanna give you better
Baby, it's whatever
Somebody gotta step up
Girl, I'm that somebody, so I'm next up
Be damned if I let him catch up
It's easy to see that you're fed up
I am on a whole 'nother level
Girl, he only fucked you over cause you let him
Fuck him, girl, I guess he didn't know any better
Girl, that man didn't show any effort
Do all I can just to show you you're special
Certain it's your love that holds me together
Lately you say he been killin' the vibe
Gotta be sick of this guy
Pull up, skrr, get in the ride
Left hand is steerin' the other is grippin' your thigh
Light up a spliff and get high
Shawty, you deserve what you've been missin'
Lookin' at you I'm thinkin' he must be trippin'
Play this song for him, tell him, "Just listen"

[Hook]
Don't
Don't

[Verse 2]
Girl, said he keeps on playin' games
And his lovin' ain't the same
I don't know what to say, but
What a shame
If you were mine you would not get the same
If you were mine you would top everything
Suicide in the drop switchin' lanes
And that thing so fire, baby, no propane
Got good pussy, girl, can I be frank?
To keep it one-hundred, girl, I ain't no saint
But he the only reason that I'm feelin' this way
Givin' you the world, baby, when you get space
Pen game get me laid, baby, that's penetrate
Oh baby

[Hook]
Don't

[Verse 3: King Vory]
H-Town got a nigga so throwed
Pour up, we can party some more
Yeah, got this drank in my cup
Got a young nigga feelin' so throwed
Spit fire in a world so cold
Young money got a nigga feelin' old
Spit fire in a world so cold
H-Town got me feelin' so throwed
H-Town got me feelin' so throwed
Ride paint and we sip 'til we fold
H-Town got me feelin' so throwed
Spit fire in a world so cold
H-Town got a nigga so throwed

[Hook]
Don't



[Chorus]
Yah, it do not matter
Turned to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smokin' that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster
Turned to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smokin' that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster

[Verse 1]
Money so old, dollars spoiled
Yah, my lil bitch so spoiled
Yah, I rub her down in oil
Yah, I got money, now you know it
Yah, diamonds on my teeth
Yah, your shit look like foil
Yah, Chris Brown said these hoes ain't loyal
None of these hoes got no morals
All my niggas G'ed up
Yah, my glasses be Dita
Never thought it would be days I could kick my feet up
Never thought that she would need me that much if I leave her

[Chorus]
It do not matter
Turned to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smokin' that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster
Turned to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smokin' that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster
Turned to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smokin' that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster

[Verse 2]
All of this was faction
No time for actin', all this money lastin'
Like, go out to eat, get that blackened salmon
When I'm wit' my girl, we Pharrell and Vashtie
Wait... huh? That mean we are not lastin'
In that pussy, you know I like it rough then I'm just blastin'
Yah, tell that lil bitch that I'm really from Mars
Uh, yah, bitch, do not start
Yah, pull up, my car automatic
Yah, uh, dealt with the star, yah!

[Chorus]
It do not matter
Turned to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smokin' that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster
Turned to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smokin' that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster



[Pre-Chorus]
I said, "Girl, why you keep callin'?"
I said, "Girl, why you keep callin'?" (Yeah)
She said, "I need a new whip (yeah)
'Cause I know that you still ballin'"
She just wanna go back to the future, so I brought that girl a DeLorean
Twenty more minutes until I got' go, so I told that girl that I'm gonna slaughter it

[Chorus]
I met that girl right up at my show
Left her man in the crowd on the floor
Out of town never saw her before
Tell her "Baby, we don't got that long"
Listen, this is not my city show
But, I treat it like my city show
Twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on (yeah)
I am not slow
These girls just want me 'cause I got the dough
Pass that girl right on my friend, give and go
He pass me her friend, so they switchin' roles (yeah)

[Verse 1]
I hit it fast (fast), yeah, I hit it slow (slow)
But by the mornin', girl, I gotta go (yeah)
I gotta get ready, tonight is my show
If you okay, you might open my show
Got the big pointers right under my nose
These niggas mad 'cause I got all the dough
These niggas mad 'cause I got all the dough (yah!)
Changin' my style 'cause I got every flow
Got every girl, ain't no toppin' my hoes (yah!)
I understand that is your girlfriend, bro
But, you know I gotta keep her close
Open your legs and I keep 'em closed
Livin' life on the edge, on a tightrope
I am so clean, I might start movin' soap (yah)
Drive a new 'Rari, I don't need a new (skrrr!)
Drive a Bugatti like it's a Volvo
I got your girl and you already know (skrrr!)
Don't really like her, we friends for the most
Cuban the truck all on my choker (skrrr!)
Don't leave the crumb, got the bread, then you toast
If you start touchin' my gun, got no holst'
I put a coat on top of my coat
Only 20 minutes before the show (show)

[Chorus]
I met that girl right up at my show
Left her man in the crowd on the floor
Out of town, never saw her before
Tell her "Baby, we don't got that long"
Listen, this is not my city show
But, I treat it like my city show
Twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on (yeah)
Twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on (yeah)
I am not slow
These girls just want me 'cause I got the dough
Pass that girl right on my friend, give and go (what)
He pass me her friend, so they switchin' roles (yeah)

[Verse 2]
Damn, I just started it (started)
Man, I just started it
Oh my God, please do not bother me
Don't got enough just to order me (yeah)
I'm on that tree like an ornament
Money so long like accordion (woo)
You lied to me, wasn't sorry then
On the weekend, you was partyin'
It was just me, you was targetin' (yeah)
It was just me, you was targetin' (target)
Jump in the Porsche, I might target it (skrr)
Jump in the Lamb, I ain't parkin' it (skrrr)
Ice is so cold, I snowboard in it (blaow)
Go to my show, they applaud me in
She call my phone with emergency (ayy)
She call my phone with that urgency (ayy)

[Pre-Chorus]
I said, "Girl, why you keep callin'?" (ayy)
I said, "Girl, why you keep callin'?" (Yeah)
She said, "I need a new whip (yeah)
'Cause I know that you still ballin'" (ball!)
She just wanna go back to the future, so I brought that girl a DeLorean (yah)
Twenty more minutes until I got' go, so I told that girl that I'm gonna slaughter it (yah)

[Chorus]
I met that girl right up at my show
Left her man in the crowd on the floor
Out of town, never saw her before
Tell her "Baby, we don't got that long"
Listen, this not my city show
But, I treat it like my city show
Twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on (yeah)
I am not slow
These girls just want me 'cause I got the dough
Pass that girl right on my friend, give and go (what?)
He pass me her friend, so they switchin' roles (yah)
Yah!





Letra de "Sensualidad" Ft. J Balvin & Prince Royce[Pre-Coro: Prince Royce]
Ay baby, tu sensualidad
Me tiene al borde de la locura
Y esto no es casualidad
Te beso y sube la temperatura

Ay baby, tu sensualidad
Me tiene al borde de la locura
Y esto no es casualidad
Te beso y sube la temperatura

[Coro: Bad Bunny & J Balvin]
Baby, donde tú quieras yo paso a buscarte
Tú espérame afuera, pa' así no llamarte
No traigas paraguas como quiera va' a mojarte
La temperatura está pa' calentarte

Baby, donde tú quieras yo paso a buscarte
Tú espérame afuera, pa' así no llamarte
No traigas paraguas como quiera va' a mojarte
La temperatura está pa' calentarte

[Verso 1: Bad Bunny]
Hay muchos tras de ti pero yo siempre gano
La baby está dura y sin el cirujano
Vístete que hoy te woa' buscar temprano
Quiero que to' nos vean agarrados de mano
Con el traje que te compré
Dale prendelo, llegamos después de las tres
Yo no sé si tú mañana me vas a querer
O si después de hoy te vas a perder
Si no tú me escribes, yo te busco en el Lamborghi'
Un diablo, un beso de emoji
Yo no sé si tú mañana me vas a querer
O si después de hoy te vas a perder

[Puente: Prince Royce]
Cuando estás en mi habitación tú sientes conmigo
Como si se paralizara el tiempo
Ya es que mi intención es estar contigo
Y hacerlo hasta dejarte sin aliento

Cuando estás en mi habitación tú sientes conmigo
Como si se paralizara el tiempo
Ya es que mi intención es estar contigo
Y hacerlo hasta dejarte sin aliento

[Coro: J Balvin & Bad Bunny]
Baby, donde tú quieras yo paso a buscarte
Tú espérame afuera, pa' así no llamarte
No traigas paraguas como quiera va' a mojarte
La temperatura está pa' calentarte

Baby, donde tú quieras yo paso a buscarte
Tú espérame afuera, pa' así no llamarte
No traigas paraguas como quiera va' a mojarte
La temperatura está pa' calentarte

[Verso 2: J Balvin]
La noche llama, ya me active
Te sirvo un trago, Buchanan's, yeh
Me siento en Victoria porque ella es un ángel
Como Selena y The Weeknd, como Shakira y Piqué
Con su hoodie de Bape, siempre ando en backstage
En Francia ya la conocen, compramos todo Chanel
Ea, porque ella es mi jeva
No me la toquen porque ella es una fiera
Ie ie, ie ie, ie, ie, ie ie
Ella es tan bella, tal como la imagine
Ie ie, ie ie, ie, ie, ie ie
Es mi baby, sólo yo la puedo tener

[Pre-Coro: Prince Royce & J Balvin]
Ay baby, tu sensualidad
Me tiene al borde de la locura
Y esto no es casualidad
Te beso y sube la temperatura

Ay baby, tu sensualidad
Me tiene al borde de la locura
Y esto no es casualidad
Te beso y sube la temperatura

[Verse 1]
Baby what's on your mind
When you see me pull up in your drive?
Do you wanna go downtown?
Maybe have a little high dollar wine?
Do you wanna go out to the country?
And maybe blow all our money
On some sugar at the truckstop and some scratch-offs
See if we can lucky?
Oh, I gotta know what's goin' on
In your beautiful mind
Baby don't be shy
And tell me now

[Chorus]
Do I
Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go
Flyin' down a two lane road?
Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Do I make you wanna let your hair down?
Play a little truth or dare now?
Act just like you don't care now?
Girl when I come around tell me
Do I make you wanna?

[Post-Chorus]
Stay up 'til the sun
Howl at the moon
Baby, tell me the truth
Do I make you wanna

[Verse 2]
Karaoke in the neon light?
Go to Vegas, stay up all night?
See if we can find a cheap flight
Little 7, come 11, baby, roll those dice
Do I make you feel pretty?
Do I make you wanna lean back, lay back and kiss me?
Do you wanna roll with me
To the mountains, to the beach, to a party in the city?
Do you wanna take in a broadway show
Or maybe just lay low?
I gotta know now

[Chorus]
Do I
Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go
Flyin' down a two lane road?
Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Do I make you wanna let your hair down?
Play a little truth or dare now?
Act just like you don't care now?
Girl when I come around tell me
Do I make you wanna?

[Bridge]
Do I make you turn into somebody else?
Do you feel like you can finally be yourself?
Baby, tell me now

[Chorus]
Do I
Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go
Flyin' down a two lane road?
Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Out in the middle of nowhere now
We can take it back downtown
You know I don't care now
Just wanna take you there now
Do I
Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go
Flyin' down a two lane road?
Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Do I make you wanna let your hair down?
Play a little truth or dare now?
Act just like you don't care now?
Girl when I come around tell me
Do I make you wanna?

[Outro]
Stay up 'til the sun?
Howl at the moon?
Oh baby
Tell me do I make you wanna?
Stay up 'til the sun?
Howl at the moon?
Baby, tell me the truth
Do I make you wanna
Let your hair down?
Play a little truth or dare now?
Act just like you don't care now?
Baby
Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go flyin' down a two lane road?
Find a limb to hang your clothes on?
Oh, babe, tell me
Do I make you wanna?



[Verse 1]
Sunday morning man
She woke up fightin' mad
Bitchin' and moanin' on and on
'Bout the time I had
And by Tuesday you could say
That girl was good as gone
Then when Thursday came around I was all alone
So I went for a drive to clear my mind
Ended up at a Shell on I-65

[Chorus 1]
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
I bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day 3 night beach vacation
Deep sea seniorita fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours

[Verse 2]
Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize
When she heard about my newfound luck
On that FM dial
And it's crazy how lately now
It just seems to come in waves
What I thought was gonna be the death of me
Was my saving grace
It's got me thinking that her leaving
Is the only logical reason

[Chorus 2]
That I got the last spot in the Hooters' parking lot
And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart
She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call
And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club raffle
Won a used 4-wheeler and three free passes
For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours

[Bridge]
Well I've been on one hell of a redneck roll
For three weeks now
And it all started on the day that she walked out

[Chorus 1]
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
Bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
And I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day 3 night beach vacation
Deep sea seniorita fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours

Bitch, you outta line, why you waste my time?
I'm tryna smoke, tryna get high, see it in my eyes
I know she playin' both sides, that bitch tellin' lies
But my dick give her a high, she down for the ride
Them hatin' bitches kill the vibe, fuck it, live your life
Bad bitches in Hawaii, umbrella with ice
10 bad bitches on my side, make 'em all my wife
Smokin' on the finest ganja, she like China white
Poppin' all these pills she said she used to it
She wanna go way up, okay baby, if you used to it
And I know that you a grown woman
And I know that you know what you're doing

I'm a street nigga, I'm supposed to really be behind bars, baby
Really wanna be faithful but this shit hard, baby
Yup, I got the pussy first and then I ignored you
You fucked another nigga, you ain't loyal
I told you bring a friend, this shit gettin' borin'
She asked me what we are, we just cordial
I'm a gangsta I can make a wet, wet turn into a pool (splash)
She help me count the money in the trap then she go back to school (school, school, school)
If a nigga ever play with bae, shit it's breaking news (pow)
She got 50 pointers on her neck, Pateks that's matchin' jewels

I get money when I want, I can fuck her if I want
Baby, you can take it off, I'm that nigga with the sauce (ayy, yeah)
Whole lot of Saint Laurent, can't remember what it cost (ayy, yeah)
Bitch, I'm feelin' like a boss, spit on it and lick it off (ayy, yeah)
You know we can run it up, tell me what you really want
I know I can break you off, come here lemme break you off
If you ever wanna fuck, can I be the one you call?
If you wanna be a star, I can tell you what it cost
I was gonna put you on, I was gonna put you on
I was gonna change your life, girl but I don't wanna break your heart

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Wet, wet, wet, wet
Wet, wet, wet, wet
Wet, wet, wet, wet

You keep hangin' 'round me, baby, you'll start talkin' like me
Got my own lingo, I can change your whole lil' ego
I be swimmin' in the money, baby, whish torpedo

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I was just hanging out
Some little west coast town
Found a bar out by the sand, so I made my way in
First thing that caught my eye, like nothing I'd ever seen
Sunburned auburn air the California dream
Yeah, she was shaking them hips
To some old motown song
I couldn't say anything so I sang along

[Chorus]
She was a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah, she's moving through my mind
I gotta know her name and I gotta see her again
She's got me wondering, yeah I'm just wondering
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?

[Verse 2]
So I just hung around this little west coast town
I dropped by every night, I stayed till closing time
My little mystery, that girl is killing me
So I put on a song just to sing along

[Chorus]
She was a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah, she's moving through my mind
I gotta know her name and I gotta see her again
She's got me wondering, yeah I'm just wondering
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
She's got me mesmerized, she's all I'm thinking about
All I think about, think about, think about

[Bridge]
So I'm right here right now
Humming this little song
If I could say a thing
I'd want you to know

[Chorus]
You were a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah, you're moving through my mind
I gotta know your name and I gotta see you again
And if you're listening, listening, listening
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
Girl, I'm hanging around this little town
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?



[Intro: Eminem]
‘Cause sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak
And when you feel weak
You feel like you wanna just give up
But you gotta search within you
And gotta find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you
And get that motivation to not give up
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall
Flat on your face and collapse

[Verse 1: Eminem]
'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
‘Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fa shizzel, my wizzel, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzels forgot, Slizzel does not give a fuck

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
André from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney — Nate, hit me!

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an emcee's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
‘Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who want some static?
‘Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

[Outro: Eminem (Nate Dogg)]
Until the roof (until the roof)
The roof comes off (the roof comes off)
Until my legs (until my legs)
Give out from (underneath me)
I will not fall, I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat me



[Verse 1: P.T. Barnum]
Right here, right now
I put the offer out
I don't want to chase you down
I know you see it
You run with me
And I can cut you free
Out of the drudgery and walls you keep in
So trade that typical for something colorful
And if it's crazy, live a little crazy
You can play it sensible, a king of conventional
Or you can risk it all and see

[Chorus: P.T. Barnum]
Don't you wanna get away from the same old part you gotta play
'Cause I got what you need
So come with me and take the ride
It'll take you to the other side
'Cause you can do like you do
Or you can do like me
Stay in the cage, or you'll finally take the key
Oh, damn! Suddenly you're free to fly
It'll take you to the other side

[Verse 2: Phillip Carlyle]
Okay, my friend, you want to cut me in
Well I hate to tell you, but it just won't happen
So thanks, but no
I think I'm good to go
'Cause I quite enjoy the life you say I'm trapped in
Now I admire you, and that whole show you do
You're onto something, really it's something
But I live among the swells, and we don't pick up peanut shells
I'll have to leave that up to you

[Chorus: Phillip Carlyle]
Don't you know that I'm okay with this uptown part I get to play
'Cause I got what I need and I don't want to take the ride
I don't need to see the other side
So go and do like you do
I'm good to do like me
Ain't in a cage, so I don't need to take the key
Oh, damn! Can't you see I'm doing fine
I don't need to see the other side

[Verse 3: P.T. Barnum]
Now is this really how you like to spend your days?
Whiskey and misery, and parties and plays

[Phillip Carlyle]
If I were mixed up with you, I'd be the talk of the town
Disgraced and disowned, another one of the clowns

[P.T. Barnum]
But you would finally live a little, finally laugh a little
Just let me give you the freedom to dream and it'll
Wake you up and cure your aching
Take your walls and start 'em breaking
Now that's a deal that seems worth taking
But I guess I'll leave that up to you

[Bridge: Phillip Carlyle]
Well it's intriguing, but to go would cost me greatly
So what percentage of the show would I be taking?

[P.T. Barnum]
Fair enough, you'd want a piece of all the action
I'd give you seven, we could shake and make it happen

[Phillip Carlyle]
I wasn't born this morning, eighteen would be just fine

[P.T. Barnum]
Why not just go ahead and ask for nickels on the dime

[Phillip Carlyle]
Fifteen

[P.T. Barnum]
I'd do eight

[Phillip Carlyle]
Twelve

[P.T. Barnum]
Maybe nine

[Phillip Carlyle]
Ten

[Chorus: Both]
Don't you wanna get away to a whole new part you're gonna play
'Cause I got what you need, so come with me and take the ride
To the other side
So if you do like I do
So if you do like me
Forget the cage, 'cause we know how to make the key
Oh, damn! Suddenly we're free to fly
We're going to the other side
So if you do like I do
(To the other side)
So if you do like me
(We're going to the other side)
'Cause if we do we're going to the other side
We're going to the other side



[Verse 1]
I can't count the times
I almost said what's on my mind
But I didn't
Just the other day
I wrote down all the things I'd say
But I couldn't
I just couldn't

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I know that you've been wondering
Mmm, so here goes nothing

[Chorus]
In case you didn't know
Baby, I'm crazy bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know

[Verse 2]
The way you look tonight
That second glass of wine
That did it
There was something 'bout that kiss
Girl it did me in
Got me thinking
I'm thinking

[Pre-Chorus]
One of the things that I've been feeling
Mmm, it's time you hear em

[Chorus]
In case you didn't know
Baby, I'm crazy bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know

[Bridge]
You've got all of me
I belong to you
Yeah you're my everything

[Chorus]
In case you didn't know
I'm crazy bout you
I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
Yeah, you had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know
In case you didn't know

Fucked all of ya'll bitches so they parties don't invite me

Carti poured a 6 in the 4 of the right lean
Damn that boy, asking for some more like the Sprite clean

These boys all up in my lane I swear they keep on merging
No I cannot see a lame 'cause my Rolls Royce got curtains

I'm in love with the guap, gave it a wedding ring
And I swear I had these thots before I got the fame
And I swear I had the Glock before I got the chain

Shoutout GiGi that's my boo, she know that I claim
Shootin' at these niggas like I'm in the paint

Woke up to niggas talking like me

[Intro: Ozuna]
Uoh oh oh
El Negrito Ojos Claros
Ozuna

[Pre-Coro: Ozuna & Natti Natasha]
Miento, si te digo que en ti no ando pensando
Quisiera saber lo que estás haciendo
Te llamo pero me sale ocupado, uoh

Tú me robaste el corazón como un criminal
Bebé yo no puedo negarlo
Esto que siento por ti no puede ser legal

[Coro: Natti Natasha, Ozuna]
Criminal, cri, criminal
Tu estilo, tu flow baby, muy criminal
Criminal, uh, criminal, ah

Criminal, cri, criminal
Tu estilo, tu flow mami, muy criminal
Criminal, cri, criminal, ah

[Verso 1: Ozuna]
Ya tú me miras como que te pongo mal
De lejos yo puedo observar lo que tu mente puede pensar
Tú me dices que yo me dejo llevar
Será porque tienes un flow demasiao' de cri-criminal, baby

Similar yo la he visto por ahí
Que solo la mire de lejitos y se ponga así, salvaje
Bailame, pero con coraje
Y deja que esta pista haga que te suba el traje

[Pre-Coro: Natti Natasha]
Miento, si te digo que en ti no ando pensando
Quisiera saber lo que estás haciendo

[Verso 2: Natti Natasha]
Como tú no hace, rompe la ley
Tú eres un delito que yo quiero cometer
Si por eso dieran tiempo, perpetuar debieras ver
Para mis problemas que no quiero resolver no

Tú me encantas, yo no te quiero mentir
Tú eres para mí, no te quiero compartir
Sin mala maña, la cosa se nos daña
Tú, no te has ido y mi cuerpo a ti te extraña

[Puente: Ozuna]
Tú me miras como que te pongo mal
De lejos yo puedo observar lo que tu mente puede pensar
Tú me dices que yo me dejo llevar
Será porque tienes un flow demasiao' de cri-criminal, baby

[Coro: Natti Natasha, Ozuna]
Criminal, cri, criminal
Tu estilo, tu flow baby, muy criminal
Criminal, uh, criminal, ah

Tu estilo, tu flow mami, muy criminal
Criminal, cri, criminal, ah

[Verse 1: Daniel Caesar]
Through drought and famine, natural disasters
My baby has been around for me
Kingdoms have fallen, angels be calling
None of that could ever make me leave
Every time I look into your eyes I see it
You're all I need
Every time I get a bit inside I feel it

[Chorus: Daniel Caesar]
Oooooooh, who would've thought I'd get you
Oooooooh, who would've thought I'd get you

[Verse 2: Daniel Caesar]
And when we're making love
Your cries they can be heard from far and wide
It's only the two of us
Everything I need's between those thighs
Every time I look into your eyes I see it
You're all I need
Every time I get a bit inside I feel it

[Chorus: Daniel Caesar]
Oooooooh, who would've thought I'd get you (oh yeah, oh yeah babe)
Oooooooh, who would've thought I'd get you

[Verse 3: Kali Uchis]
And I’ll take some time
Just to be thankful
That I had days full of you, you
Before it winds down into
The memories, it’s all just memories
La-la-la-la-la

[Bridge: Daniel Caesar]
(If you've got someone you like...)
Don't you love when I come around
(...feel something that's right somebody just tell somebody)
Build you up then I take you down
(If you've got someone you like...)
Don't you love when I come around
(...feel something that's right somebody just tell somebody)
Build you up then I take...

[Chorus: Daniel Caesar]
Oooooooh, who could've thought I'd get you
Oooooooh, who could've thought I'd get you

[Outro: Kali Uchis]
This feels like summer
Boy you make me feel so alive
Just be my lover
Boy you'll lead me to paradise
